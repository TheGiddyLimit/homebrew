It's a level of detail that you don't find in many adventure stories. The food that one encounters traveling across Exandria doesn't just help immerse the audience into the story, it makes us downright HUNGRY. And this wonderfully crafted cookbook is a remarkable chance to share the wonders of Matt's imaginary cuisine and make it a tastable, cookable reality. The chefs, cooks, tasters, editors, writers, artists, and photographers who contributed to this book poured themselves into developing recipes that aren't merely homages to their favorite fantasy campaign\u2014they're actually really great dishes. And armed with the recipes in these pages, you'll be able to entertain guests with novel, and sometimes very strange, dinners, while sharing the stories of Critical Role to a new, hungry audience."

								"It began, as the best things do, with a group of friends sitting around a table.",
								"We were reading {@i The Daring Trials and Tribulations of Sir Taryon Darrington} in our book club. (If you haven't read it yourself, give it a try: it is a wild ride.) Since most of us are good with food, and a book club is hardly worth the name without snacks, we try to bring treats themed to the book we're reading. Sir Darrington does provide quite a bit of detail about everything in his adventures, including what he eats. Some of his accounts were confounding, though. For instance, a drink called {@recipe The Changebringer's Nectar|ExEx|Changebringer's Nectar} that he describes as \"maple syrup grain alcohol\" sounds terrible, but he declares it to be tasty. We were intrigued.",
								"As we mentioned, most of us are skilled at experimenting with food and having it come out well. (One of us, it must be said, is hopeless in the kitchen. She's great at complimenting the chefs, though, and she spins a good yarn.) But we found that {@creature Taryon Darrington|TDCSR|Sir Darrington's} descriptions, while evocative, weren't enough to actually cook from. We needed more information. How does one actually {@i make} this stuff?",
								"Happily, one of us was traveling through {@book Deastok|EGW|4|Deastok} soon after that, and she managed to talk the bartender at the Grumpy Lily tavern into giving up {@i two} of his recipes. He may have been willing to share his secrets because both drinks are nearly impossible to make at home, but we were undeterred. We tried. We failed. We tried again. Finally, we reproduced versions of both drinks that we were satisfied with, and we celebrated by drinking far too much of them.",
								"We had triumphed, and we wanted to do it again. Now it was bothering us: there were so many special meals, so many delicious drinks, throughout Exandria that we had never tried, never mind tried to make. We wanted more exploration, more experimentation, more recipes. We aren't cut out to be brigadiers like Taryon and his crew, but we could have adventures in our own way. We could find our own type of treasure. It turned into a hobby: go on vacation, bring back a recipe. Then it turned into a mission: who can get to Vasselheim in time for Highsummer?",
								"In our search for food, we found far more stories than we were expecting. It turns out the two are tied together more often than not, and the food is so much better when you know how it came to be. So we collected recipes, and we collected tales, and we brought them back to share with one another around the table. Before we knew it, our book club had created a book. There is so much more to explore and eat and make in this world, but it became time for us to stop sharing with one another and start sharing with you.",
								"Here, at last, is the product of our adventures, a list of our labors, little slices of this exquisite place we live in that you can re-create at home. We hope you enjoy these banquets, bites, and beverages from across Exandria\u2014and the stories behind them."

						"You may think you know what Tal'Dorei cuisine is like. {@i Oh}, you say,{@i  I've eaten at A Taste of Tal'Dorei. I've had Thordak's Pepper Poppers; it's basically like I've been to Emon. Why, the Rimelord told me I might survive his frozen death!}",
						"Or perhaps, reading this, you're forming a different impression. {@i Ah}, you're thinking. {@i They're about to dunk hard on A Taste of Tal'Dorei. Here it comes! Make sure to mention the bored theater majors pretending they're evil warlords and stuff!}",
						"So let's get this out of the way, right at the beginning: if there is a place in Exandria today that has earned its cheesy enjoyments, it's Tal'Dorei. If there is a place worthy of celebrating with overblown drama and collectible pencils, it's Tal'Dorei. Come with us on a short tour of the past, so we can remind you of the forces shaping Tal'Dorei's culture, cuisine, and dinner theater entertainment alike. Because, while all of Exandria has been through turmoil, Tal'Dorei is the place that has been most recently and thoroughly turned upside down.",
						"No corner of Exandria, of course, escaped the ravages of {@book the Calamity|TDCSR|1|The Calamity}. Afterward, the land that would become Tal'Dorei went through a time of rebuilding. The dwarves beneath the northern mountains burrowed deep to form the subterranean city of {@book Kraghammer|TDCSR|3|Kraghammer}. A group of elves who had magically transported themselves to the Fey Realm to escape the terrors of the Calamity returned to the {@book Verdant Expanse|TDCSR|3|Verdant Expanse} in the south, founding the city of {@book Syngorn|TDCSR|3|Syngorn}. Then humans crossed the Ozmit Sea and spread up the western side of Tal'Dorei, establishing settlements and fighting for power.",
						"Eventually the humans' shortsightedness and violence erupted into war. Three decades of bloodshed and tumult later, a young warrior named {@book Zan Tal'Dorei|TDCSR|1|Tal'Dorei Ascendant} reunified people under her leadership. A council was nominated to rule alongside her in the capital city of {@book Emon|TDCSR|3|Emon, the City of Fellowship}. The realm was renamed in her honor. Everyone was ready to lay down their arms and rest.",
						"But, just two years later, Errevon the Rimelord attacked the still-reeling continent. The {@book Tal'Dorei Council|TDCSR|2|Tal'Dorei Council}, {@book Syngorn|TDCSR|3|Syngorn}, and {@book Kraghammer|TDCSR|3|Kraghammer} united against the ice elemental spirit, pushed him back into the rift, and with the help of the {@book Ashari druids|TDCSR|2|The Ashari}, sealed it.",
						"The land had been permanently altered. Two formerly fertile regions were cursed and scarred by the wars, known ever after as the blighted {@book Umbra Hills|TDCSR|3|Umbra Hills} and the icy {@book Frostweald|TDCSR|3|The Frostweald}. Finally, though, a period of peace came. Tal'Dorei became an empire. Generations passed. The upheavals in the land were minor and absorbed with relative aplomb. When a wizard living in the {@book Bramblewood|TDCSR|3|The Bramblewood} botched a spell and flooded the eastern forest with a thousand surprised chickens, the enterprising folks of nearby {@book Westruun|TDCSR|3|Westruun} just shrugged and set up a new export market. The Great Feathering of 641 PD is still spoken of in mostly fond terms, a minor blip in a calm century. Still, in hindsight, it doesn't seem like enough rest.",
						"About fifty years ago, the avaricious red dragon known as {@book Thordak, the Cinder King|TDCSR|1|Thordak, the Cinder King}, laid waste to the {@book Mornset Countryside|TDCSR|3|Mornset Countryside} in the south. His banishment to the Elemental Plane of Fire lasted more than a decade, but while there, he grew stronger and formed an alliance with four other chromatic dragons. At the end of 810 PD, Thordak broke free of his planar prison, and the {@book Chroma Conclave|TDCSR|1|The Chroma Conclave} ravaged {@book Emon|TDCSR|3|Emon, the City of Fellowship}. {@book Thordak|TDCSR|1|Thordak, the Cinder King} settled amid the ruins of the capital, while his three compatriots spread out across the continent, bringing devastation wherever their attention landed.",
						"And by then he only had three remaining compatriots, because the adventuring group Vox Machina had already dispatched the blue dragon Brimscythe.",
						"Eventually all the land would hear of these heroes: {@creature Champion of Ravens|TDCSR|Vax'ildan}, the thief and assassin from {@book Byroden|TDCSR|3|Byroden} who became the champion of the {@deity The Matron of Ravens|Exandria|TDCSR|Matron of Ravens, goddess of death}. {@creature Vex'ahlia|TDCSR}, Vax's twin sister, the broomstick-riding archer who became the champion of the {@deity The Dawnfather|Exandria|TDCSR|Dawnfather}, and her bear companion, {@creature Trinket|TDCSR}. {@creature Percival de Rolo|TDCSR|Percival Fredrickstein von Musel Klossowski de Rolo III}, lord of Whitestone and Vex's eventual husband, the deadly marksman and brilliant inventor who built Exandria's first firearms. {@creature Keyleth, Voice of the Tempest|TDCSR|Keyleth} of the Air Ashari, wielder of nature magic, who became the near-immortal Voice of the Tempest. {@creature Grog Strongjaw|TDCSR}, the hulking half-giant brawler, who forged the weapons that defeated a god. {@creature Scanlan Shorthalt|TDCSR}, teller of tales, singer of sorcerous songs, and master of the {@spell Mordenkainen's Magnificent Mansion|PHB|magical mansion}, who became the champion of the {@deity The Knowing Mentor|Exandria|TDCSR|Knowing Mentor}. And {@creature Pike Trickfoot|TDCSR}, warrior and healer of the {@deity The Everlight|Exandria|TDCSR|Everlight}, who brought most of the group back from the dead, some of them multiple times.{@footnote [*]|{@creature Taryon Darrington|TDCSR}, the arcane builder and author from Wildemount and original spark of inspiration for this book, joined the group after their defeat of the {@book Chroma Conclave|TDCSR|1|The Chroma Conclave}. He left a short time later to form the heralded Darrington Brigade.}",
						"Together, wielding force, diplomacy, leadership, and a set of truly legendary arms and armor, Vox Machina slew the remaining four dragons of the {@book Chroma Conclave|TDCSR|1|The Chroma Conclave}. It took them only four weeks.",
						"But in those weeks, so much damage had been done. Countless people were dead, thousands of acres of crops were destroyed, supply routes and food stores across the continent were strained to their breaking point. The stability and structure of Tal'Dorei had been turned on its head. Again.",
						"And now, today, is a time of rebuilding in Tal'Dorei. Again. Many find themselves focusing inward, away from the wider world. The year after {@book Thordak|TDCSR|1|Thordak, the Cinder King} and his allies were slain, news arrived: Vox Machina was confronting a lich who threatened the existence of everyone in Exandria. {@i Where is this lich?} the people of Tal'Dorei asked. {@i Across the sea, in Issylra}, came the answer. {@i Well, then}, people responded, {@i we'll worry about that trouble when it gets here}. Since then, a generation of relative quiet has come and gone, but Tal'Dorei has not had nearly enough rest.",
						"This, finally, brings us to the food of Tal'Dorei today, and we are honored to bring you the recipes that follow. From {@book Whitestone|TDCSR|3|Whitestone} in the north to the {@book Rifenmist Jungle|TDCSR|3|Rifenmist Jungle} in the south, we have gathered dishes of every size, from a quick snack to a breakfast feast. Tal'Dorei's grand institution of greasy pub food is of course represented. The bounty of Tal'Dorei's lush forests is referenced with several instances of tree nuts, though we have limited ourselves to the common varieties and would not recommend delving into the {@book Verdant Expanse|TDCSR|3|Verdant Expanse} in search of fey-touched food. Even the Great Feathering gets a nod, as we feature chicken in several of our selections (though poultry has also become trendy on the continent in recent decades, after word spread that {@creature Scanlan Shorthalt|TDCSR} was partial to it).",
						"But those are just ingredients, and what ties Tal'Dorei cuisine together is more a matter of culture. For that, let's return to contemplating everyone's favorite historically themed dinner theater. Because A Taste of Tal'Dorei, when you get down to it, understands the continent it is celebrating.",
						"Amid the spectacle and the breading, the thing that A Taste of Tal'Dorei gets most right is the emphasis on comfort. {@i Enjoy your drinks. Pack in the food. It's been hard out there, and it will be hard again. The rest will never last long enough, not nearly. But in here, while we're eating, it's okay. Hoist that souvenir tankard high. We will all survive the Rimelord's frozen death.}",
						"And so, we invite you to make these meals in the same spirit. Whether it's pastries or pies, meat or mayonnaise, we hope these dishes can bring you a moment of respite in a rough world, a taste of Tal'Dorei in a troubled time. Cheers.",

								"After halting an evil god's incursion into the Lightless Lands Below, joining the Vasselheim hunting guild the Slayer's Take, liberating the city of Whitestone from the rule of Delilah and Sylas Briarwood, defeating five dragons, and along the way, resurrecting their party members from death ten separate times, the heroes of Vox Machina needed a break from adventuring. But they found that they couldn't sit idle. So half of the team\u2014{@creature Vex'ahlia|TDCSR}, {@creature Pike Trickfoot|TDCSR|Pike}, {@creature Keyleth, Voice of the Tempest|TDCSR|Keyleth}, and {@creature Taryon Darrington|TDCSR|Taryon}\u2014decided to use their skills at hunting fearsome beasts, channeling the divine, harnessing the elements, and building robots to...open a bakery. The result was the {@book Slayer's Cake in Whitestone|TDCSR|3|8. Slayer's Cake Bakery}!",
								"The bakery's opening seasons were somewhat {@footnote bumpy,*|One notable bump: the time their new hire turned out to be a bounty hunter who promptly kidnapped Taryon.} but the renown of its founders and the ongoing refinements to their recipes paid off. The Slayer's Cake is now loved across Tal'Dorei and beyond. Even though the bakery is branching out into new territories, access to its wares is still limited: if you can't get to Whitestone, Emon, or {@book Nicodranas|EGW|4|Nicodranas}, you're out of luck.",
								"Until now.",
								"Here you will find the original, proprietary recipes for three of the Slayer's Cake's most notable delicacies. The spicy smoothness of {@recipe Slayer's Cake Sun Treats|ExEx|Sun Treats}. The tangy creaminess of {@recipe Everlight-as-Air Scones|ExEx}. And, of course, the nutty deliciousness of {@recipe Trinket's Bear Claws|ExEx} (with a cinnamon kick, if you prefer them Nicodranas-style). They can now be yours at any time, no adventuring required.",

						"Let's leave Tal'Dorei now, crossing the Ozmit Sea north and west, heading for Issylra, the birthplace of civilization. Before we can understand this storied land and its cuisine, we need to briefly review the long, awe-inspiring, often troubled relationship between Exandria, the gods, and magic. Of course, we at Exquisite Exandria are not authorities on the deep mysteries of the universe, so we'll begin with some sweeping generalities.",
						"In the time of the {@book Founding|TDCSR|1|The Founding}, the gods shaped the many peoples of Exandria, gifting them morsels of their divine power to help them survive. Magic was born. With the aid of magic, the mortal races developed tools to not just survive but thrive. Civilizations were founded, and the people of those civilizations remembered to thank the gods for their gifts. Organized religion was born.",
						"{@book The Founding|TDCSR|1|The Founding}, however, was not the beginning of Exandria's history. The gods found Exandria, already extant, with a race of elemental titans called the Primordials already living there. Angered with the gods, their people, and their meddling with the land, {@book the Primordials rose up and attacked|TDCSR|1|Wrath of the Primordials}. The people called to their gods for help.",
						"Some of the gods said no. They sided with the Primordials against their divine brethren, becoming what we now refer to as the {@table Betrayer Gods|TDCSR}. A terrible conflict followed, ending with the gods thereafter known as the {@table Prime Deities|TDCSR} locking the {@table Betrayer Gods|TDCSR} away in other planes of existence. Afterward, as civilization once again thrived, the people of Exandria knew for sure: These were gods that loved them. These were gods worthy of their loyalty.",
						"But time passed, and people forgot. Magic flourished beyond all previous bounds, unlocking ever more secrets. Huge cities like {@book Aeor|EGW|4|Aeor Crash Site} and Avalir rose from the ground and flew. Arduous tasks could be accomplished in an eyeblink. What does being a god mean, when anyone who studies the arcane hard enough can stop time or create life? As civilization's thriving soured into indulgence, mortals decided they wanted to find out. Some attempted to become gods. One, the {@deity The Matron of Ravens|Exandria|TDCSR|Matron of Ravens}, even succeeded. In the misguided experimentation that followed, the {@table Betrayer Gods|TDCSR} were freed. God fought god once again, with disastrous results. During {@book the Calamity|TDCSR|1|The Calamity} that followed, at least two-thirds of the population of Exandria was killed, lands were left barren, and most traces of civilization were destroyed.",
						"Except for Vasselheim. The rest of Issylra became, and largely remains, untamed wilderness, but Vasselheim survived. After banishing the {@table Betrayer Gods|TDCSR} again, the {@table Prime Deities|TDCSR} chose to lock themselves beyond the Divine Gate, removing their ability to act directly upon Exandria. Vasselheim, the Dawn City, was where they made this announcement. Vasselheim was the last city standing after the gods warred, Vasselheim was where the gods departed this plane of existence, and Vasselheim, the people swore, was where the gods would be forever remembered.",
						"After the departure of the gods, an event known as the Divergence, many things started anew. The calendar, to name one example, began counting years PD, \"Post Divergence.\" But Vasselheim endured, Vasselheim remembered, and that continues to this day.",
						"Vasselheim refuses to make the mistakes of its ancestors. Arcane magic\u2014the kind not directly inspired by the divine, the kind that brought about {@book the Calamity|TDCSR|1|The Calamity}\u2014is banned within the city. Each of the major sections of the city is dedicated to a Prime Deity: the Abundant Terrace to the {@deity The Wildmother|Exandria|TDCSR|Wildmother}, goddess of nature; the Quadroads to the {@deity The Lawbearer|Exandria|TDCSR|Lawbearer}, goddess of civilization; the Braving Grounds to the {@deity The Stormlord|Exandria|TDCSR|Stormlord}, god of glory and strength; the Silver Talon's Reach to the {@deity The Platinum Dragon|Exandria|TDCSR|Platinum Dragon}, god of justice and protection; and the Duskmeadow District to the {@deity The Matron of Ravens|Exandria|TDCSR|Matron of Ravens, goddess of death}. Other {@table Prime Deities|TDCSR} are also worshipped in temples across the city, such as the {@deity The Dawnfather|Exandria|TDCSR|Dawnfather}, god of the sun, summer, and time; the {@deity The Changebringer|Exandria|TDCSR|Changebringer}, goddess of freedom and adventure; and the {@deity The Everlight|Exandria|TDCSR|Everlight}, goddess of compassion and redemption.",
						"But now it's time to focus on the food. Issylra has always been a cold place of isolated settlements, so the cuisine has developed from that mentality. Even in times of plenty, food in such a place never stops being precious. Heavy emphasis is placed on hunting, marking the seasons, and avoiding waste, all to ensure that food stores are sufficient and life is sustained. But the people of Issylra also use meals as a form of worship. There are, of course, the celebratory feasts throughout the year to honor one or more of the {@table Prime Deities|TDCSR}. The food served at these religious meals is usually elaborate, requiring hours of preparation and meticulous attention. Especially in Vasselheim, though, most everyday dinners are also sit-down affairs, not necessarily somber, but certainly ritualized and formal. With each bite, whether consciously or subconsciously, the people of Vasselheim renew their vow. {@i We remember and thank the gods who saved us. We honor their magic and practice no other. We remember the hubris that nearly destroyed us. We will never forget again.}",
						"In the following pages, we have collected a range of these commemorative dishes. For those times when you're in the mood to celebrate good company or a good harvest or if you just want to try some unusual cookies, home cooks and professional chefs across Issylra have opened their recipe books to help. All they ask is that you do as they do when they sit down to eat: Remember your blessings, and learn from your mistakes.",

						"Now we travel south, away from the cold wilderness of Issylra to a continent of very different extremes: Marquet.",
						"Pre-Divergence, Marquet was lush from coast to coast, a mix of dense jungles and arable plains. {@book The Calamity|TDCSR|1|The Calamity} changed the nature of much of the land here, as it did elsewhere. Weird magics twisted the jungles into dangerous fey-touched wilderness, shattered the plains into jagged mountain ranges, and obliterated the settlements. One elven city in particular, Cael Morrow in the northeast, drew the wrath of the Betrayer God known as {@deity the Ruiner|Exandria|TDCSR|The Ruiner}. He drove his spear clean through the city and the ground below, detonating a third of the continent in one gigantic strike. The cities and jungles that were in the way exploded into rubble and dust, which settled to become the sands of the Rumedam Desert.",
						"Given this disastrous change\u2014destruction all around, the loss of most staple food sources, and altered landscapes that were now actively trying to kill the inhabitants in many new ways\u2014the people of Marquet responded with variations on a theme: exploration. Some left the continent entirely and struck out across the seas, founding the settlements that would become the {@book Menagerie Coast in Wildemount|EGW|4|Menagerie Coast}, and financing the growth of {@book Emon|TDCSR|3|Emon, the City of Fellowship} in Tal'Dorei. But many Marquesians set out to explore their old home anew.",
						"Crossing the newly formed desert, hopeful traders discovered an oasis at the former site of Cael Morrow. They sunk wells and established caravan routes. Travelers began to arrive and to stay. What began as a simple trade post soon grew into a thriving community\u2014and just as soon after, it began to descend into thievery and abuse. Then a mysterious, seemingly immortal figure named J'mon Sa Ord appeared and brought the city into order. Ank'Harel, meaning \"Jewel of Hope\" in {@language Marquesian|EGW}, was officially founded under their leadership. J'mon Sa Ord has ruled there ever since, providing the stability and protection that has allowed Ank'Harel to flower into the cultural center of the continent.",
						"Striking into the Oderan Wilds in the northwest, explorers found five huge rock spires rising from the dense canopy. Some theorize that the spires were once a single mountain, rent during {@book the Calamity|TDCSR|1|The Calamity}. Other fanciful souls tell tales of a stone titan buried beneath the earth, with only the fingers of one hand left sticking aboveground to mark their passing. Whatever the case, the spires offered stable land above the dangerous jungle floor, and rock rich with metal, ore, and gems. Builders and miners went up and into the spires, and the city of Jrusar was born.",
						"The nature of these two cities, both trading hubs\u2014one a desert oasis and the other an oasis of rock amid the wild jungle\u2014made them natural melting pots. Both cities opened skyports, allowing safer travel along the trade routes, and both drew settlers from across Marquet and eventually across Exandria. These settlers naturally brought their cultures with them: their worship, their dress, their language, and their food.",
						"Some stayed in the cities. Others struck out, continuing to explore and reclaim the continent. Deeper in the Oderan Wilds, settlements like Heartmoor Hamlet used the jungle to their advantage in growing new crops, while the most adventurous settlers began tasting the fruits of the odd, fey-touched trees. Across the Rumedam to the north, at the base of the Aggrad Mountains, is the Bay of Gifts. The mild weather and sandy beaches make that stretch of coast perfect for a port and also a vacation, and the city of Shammel was born to serve both needs. Across Marquet, settlements took hold once again, in friendly and unfriendly land alike, driven by the spirit of exploration and experimentation.",
						"You don't have to look far to find that spirit infusing the cuisine of this amazing continent. Forests full of bizarre fruit trees, and soil yielding unusual, unpredictable crops? It's fine; stick 'em in some salads or brew 'em up for stew. Deserts infested with huge acid-spitting bugs? You could avoid them\u2014or you could hunt them and use their spit to make alcohol. Sure, there were failed experiments. Many of them. But what we hear about today, beyond cautionary tales like \"never eat skirath meat without cooking it thoroughly,\" are the successful ones, and the {@i most} successful ones are famous across Exandria. This is why you get folks from Wildemount who swear by a Marquesian cooking spice, and folks in Tal'Dorei whose favorite treat is a Marquesian cake.",
						"And so we bring you the following recipes, successful experiments and worthwhile explorations all. Without leaving your kitchen, you can wander into the labyrinthine neighborhoods within the spires of Jrusar, delve into the jungles of the Oderan Wilds, traverse the markets and caravans of Ank'Harel, venture into the Rumedam Desert, or relax by the Bay of Gifts. Sample famous spices and infamous brews, try a strange new vegetable or two, or just make a fantastic sandwich. Whatever you choose, enjoy the journey, and be pleased.",

						"Finally, we travel back the way we came, north and east over the Lucidian Ocean to Tal'Dorei, and then past it, across the Ozmit Sea, to Wildemount. Wildemount is a continent that, in the best of times, thrives on its interconnectedness. This has huge appeal to us, of course, because one of the many magical things about food is its ability to bring people together. But before we can expand on that theme, we need to set the table, as it were, by skimming briefly back through some of Wildemount's worst, most divided times.",
						"We'll start with the continent's most literal divide: the {@book Ashkeeper Peaks|EGW|4|Ashkeeper Peaks}. East of the Peaks is {@book Xhorhas|EGW|4|Wastes of Xhorhas}, the land that saw the bitter end of {@book the Calamity|TDCSR|1|The Calamity}. Here, the {@table Prime Deities|EGW} brought the fight to {@book Ghor Dranas|EGW|4|Rosohna (Ghor Dranas)}, the city of the {@table Betrayer Gods|EGW}. By the time the fighting was done, {@book Ghor Dranas|EGW|4|Rosohna (Ghor Dranas)} was in ruins, and the land for miles around was cursed, poisoned, and infested with monstrosities. Yet from this destruction came an unexpected ray of hope, a literal light in the darkness. A society of elves living deep under {@book Ghor Dranas|EGW|4|Rosohna (Ghor Dranas)}, inspired by a deity they called the {@deity The Luxon, The First Radiance|Exandria|EGW|Luxon}, made their way to the surface and claimed the ruins as their own. The house, or den, of Kryn united the other families under their name, founding the {@book Kryn Dynasty|EGW|3|Kryn Dynasty} that endures to this day with the aptly named {@book Rosohna|EGW|4|Rosohna (Ghor Dranas)}, or \"Rebirth,\" as its capital city. Strong magic allows the elves to cast the city in perpetual night, shielding their eyes from the full strength of the sun. That magic is one of many ever-present reminders of how different the Dynasty is from the rest of Wildemount, and rumor and superstition still thrive centuries later. Outside of {@book Xhorhas|EGW|4|Wastes of Xhorhas}, in fact, many insist on calling {@book Rosohna|EGW|4|Rosohna (Ghor Dranas)} \"Ghor Dranas\" to this day.",
						"Among those who assumed ill intent of the {@book Kryn|EGW|3|Kryn Dynasty} were the rulers of the {@book Dwendalian Empire|EGW|3|Dwendalian Empire}, the neighboring power that controls much of the land west of the Ashkeepers. In a throwback to the beliefs that sparked {@book the Calamity|TDCSR|1|The Calamity}, the Dwendalian kings have declared that divine magic and most religious worship are trickery and deceit. The Kryn's worship of the {@deity The Luxon, The First Radiance|Exandria|EGW|Luxon}, therefore, is considered deeply threatening. Most recently, the {@book Cerberus Assembly|EGW|3|Cerberus Assembly}, the powerful mage faction that advises the throne, joined King Bertrand Dwendal in proclaiming that the Dynasty had evil designs on Empire lands. The fear this stoked helped king and assembly keep the people of the Empire under totalitarian control for decades.",
						"When two of the {@item Luxon Beacon|EGW|Luxon beacons}, the Kryn's most precious artifacts, went missing, the Kryn sent two soldiers to the Empire city of {@book Zadash|EGW|4|Zadash} to attempt their recovery. The attempt went bad, the Empire declared war, armies deployed from both sides, and the well-being of the people of Wildemount teetered in the balance.",
						"But less than a year later, the war between the {@book Kryn Dynasty|EGW|3|Kryn Dynasty} and the {@book Dwendalian Empire|EGW|3|Dwendalian Empire} was over. A group of adventurers known as the Mighty Nein had succeeded in brokering talks between the two peoples. The beacons were found and returned, political prisoners were exchanged, and an uneasy peace was declared. Two months later, again spurred by the Mighty Nein, the {@book Cobalt Soul|EGW|3|Library of the Cobalt Soul} opened investigations into evildoing by the mage Trent Ikithon and the Assembly.",
						"In the span of a season, this motley group of friends had stopped a war and felled a pillar of corruption at the heart of a totalitarian government. They had tipped the balance of a continent from aggression to cooperation, from division to connection. Their deeds aren't as well documented as those of Vox Machina, but word has trickled in from across Wildemount that the Nein aren't merely diplomats or spies. They rescued a small town from a harmful cult, killed a group of slavers, and closed dangerous abyssal rifts beneath the city of {@book Asarius|EGW|4|Asarius, the City of Beasts}, to name but a few of their heroic acts. They've been as far south as {@book Darktow|EGW|4|Darktow}, where they were seen conversing with the Plank King, and as far north as {@book Uthodurn|EGW|4|Uthodurn} in the {@book Flotket Alps|EGW|4|Flotket Alps}. They were even rumored to be exploring frigid {@book Eiselcross|EGW|4|Eiselcross}, searching for the ruined flying city of {@book Aeor|EGW|4|Aeor Crash Site}. They've got members from the Empire, from southern {@book Xhorhas|EGW|4|Wastes of Xhorhas}, from the neutral {@book Menagerie Coast|EGW|4|Menagerie Coast}, from the lawless {@book Greying Wildlands|EGW|4|Greying Wildlands}, and possibly from the {@book Kryn Dynasty|EGW|3|Kryn Dynasty} itself. So who are they, really?",
						"There's Caleb Widogast, rumored to be Trent Ikithon's former student\u2014a mage who can manipulate gravity, command flame, and create invisible towers, who was often seen in the company of his magical cat, Frumpkin. Beauregard Lionett\u2014a hand-to-hand fighter from the Empire town of {@book Kamordah|EGW|4|Kamordah} and expositor of the {@book Cobalt Soul|EGW|3|Library of the Cobalt Soul}\u2014is also the heir of a successful wine family. Yasha Nydoorin is a fierce brawler from south {@book Xhorhas|EGW|4|Wastes of Xhorhas}, a devotee of the {@deity The Stormlord|Exandria|TDCSR|Stormlord}, and Beau's partner. Jester Lavorre, the healer from {@book Nicodranas|EGW|4|Nicodranas} on the {@book Menagerie Coast|EGW|4|Menagerie Coast}, has a famous sweet tooth and is the daughter of the renowned courtesan known as the Ruby of the Sea. Fjord Stone, an accomplished sailor from the {@book Menagerie Coast|EGW|4|Menagerie Coast} who now fights in the {@deity The Wildmother|Exandria|TDCSR|Wildmother's} name, is also Jester's partner and a rumored one-time pirate captain. Veth Brenatto, known for a time as Nott the Brave, uses her thief's skill set, deadly crossbow, and tricky magic to protect the ones she loves, including her husband and son. Caduceus Clay, healer of the {@deity The Wildmother|Exandria|TDCSR|Wildmother}, joined the group from the {@book Savalirwood|EGW|4|Savalirwood} in the {@book Greying Wildlands|EGW|4|Greying Wildlands}, and his comforting presence and healing touch kept everyone alive more than once. The Mighty Nein have also been seen with a colorful horned swordsman and, on a few occasions, with {@book Essek Thelyss|EGW|3|Shadowhand Essek Thelyss}, a mage high in the {@book Kryn Dynasty's|EGW|3|Kryn Dynasty} pecking order. Counting those two would bring us to a very satisfying total of nine, but since \"Mighty Nein\" just means \"Big No,\" we suspect that's a coincidence.",
						"In any case, the Mighty Nein represents the best of Wildemount culture: a huge range of people, side by side, who lose none of their uniqueness. All these lands, all these cultures, exist next to each other across the continent. The militaristic, rule-bound Empire; the striving, driven Dynasty; the fiercely independent {@book Menagerie Coast|EGW|4|Menagerie Coast}; and the wild lands that surround them can, and should, continue to salute and respect each other.",
						"And so we've taken our cue from the Nein and brought you a range of dishes from north, south, east, and west: a drink from {@book Deastok|EGW|4|Deastok} next to one from {@book Aeor|EGW|4|Aeor Crash Site}, meat pies from {@book Xhorhas|EGW|4|Wastes of Xhorhas} next to mushroom toast from the {@book Savalirwood|EGW|4|Savalirwood}. Sweet and savory, vegetarian and meat-loving, heavy and light, alcohol-free and so-alcoholic-it-might-actually-explode. Do we need to fight over which one is right, which one is best? {@i Nein}.",

Continue to whisk until the mixture comes to a simmer, 6 to 8 minutes. Simmer, whisking occasionally, until the mixture is thickened and the consistency is a smooth and velvety gravy, 7 to 10 minutes.

Turn off the heat, remove the bowl from the saucepan, and carefully wipe any water off the bottom of the bowl. Place the bowl on a dry kitchen towel or trivet.

Add the slab bacon, skin side down, and turn to coat in the cooking liquid. Place the baking dish on a baking sheet, cover the dish with foil, and braise in the oven for 1 hour. Remove the baking dish from the oven, turn the bacon over, cover again with foil, and continue to braise until the bacon is tender, about 1 more hour. Remove from the oven and turn off the heat. Remove the foil and let the bacon cool completely in the liquid, about 2 hours.",
				"Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and set aside. Remove the bacon from the braising liquid and cut crosswise into ¼-inch-thick slices. Arrange the bacon slices on the prepared baking sheet in a single layer. Skim and discard the excess fat from the top of the braising liquid and transfer the remaining liquid (about 1½ cups / 360ml) to a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then lower the heat to a strong simmer and cook until reduced to ½ cup / 120ml, 20 to 25 minutes. Pour the thin glaze into a small bowl and stir in the remaining 2 tablespoons of honey. Set aside while you preheat the oven; the glaze will thicken up slightly as it sits.",
				"Preheat the oven to 425°F / 220°C. Brush the tops of the slab bacon with some of the glaze and bake until the glaze is bubbling and the bacon is lightly caramelized in spots, 7 to 10 minutes. Gently turn the bacon slices over, brush with more glaze, and cook until the second side is lightly browned and caramelized, 5 to 7 additional minutes. Brush any remaining glaze onto the bacon, then transfer to a serving plate.",
				"Place a cooling rack on top of a baking sheet and set aside. Fill a large cast-iron skillet with ½ inch of canola oil and bring to 350°F / 175°C over medium-high heat. While the oil is heating up, crack 3 of the eggs into a shallow bowl, season with salt and black pepper, and whisk until smooth. In a second shallow bowl, stir together the flour and a large pinch of salt and black pepper. In a third shallow bowl, stir together the cornmeal, panko bread crumbs, granulated garlic, paprika, cayenne pepper, 1½ teaspoons of salt, and a couple of grinds of black pepper.",
				"Dip the sliced tomatoes first in the flour, then the eggs, and then the cornmeal mixture to coat completely. In batches, fry until golden brown and crispy, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to the cooling rack to catch excess oil, and season liberally with salt.",
				"In a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat, warm a thin layer of canola oil until it begins to lightly shimmer. Carefully crack 4 of the eggs into the skillet and cook until the whites are mostly set and starting to brown around the edges and the yolks are still very soft, 2 to 3 minutes. To help the egg whites cook more evenly, tip the skillet slightly so that the oil pools to one side of the skillet, and spoon the hot oil over any of the uncooked egg whites. Continue spooning the oil over the egg whites until they are cooked to your liking. Transfer the fried eggs to a large platter and cook the remaining 4 eggs, adding more oil to the skillet if needed. Season the eggs with salt and pepper and serve immediately alongside the glazed slab bacon and fried tomatoes."

				"For those travelers who get too deep in their cups, there are always inns like the Nestled Nook. Innkeeper Yorda will set you up with a warm bed for the night and a warm breakfast in the morning (or whenever you manage to get downstairs). Yorda has a range of foods on offer, but it's the meat selection that really sets the Nestled Nook apart. We've recreated two of her most popular dishes here: brats and bacon. Note how they both meet a need that less experienced innkeepers might overlook: namely, portability. The brat comes in a convenient bun, so we'd suggest eating that one first. You can stick the bacon in your pocket for later."

When the little girl offered to grant a wish in return, Madame Parcata made an ill-advised choice, wishing to have great fame and worth. As payment in kind for her inhospitable greed, she was turned into a huge purple jewel, as big as an apple. This is the story behind the delicacy known as the Purple Jewel Cake of Marquet, beloved by people across Exandria, including Vox Machina's {@creature Pike Trickfoot|TDCSR}. The story changes depending on the teller, but all agree on two things: the part about the apple is important, and the cake is delicious."

The tavern stayed open, free of stench clouds, and unattacked by ducks, so...probably?} which we have recreated here."

				"The Lavish Chateau in {@book Nicodranas|EGW|4|Nicodranas} is a lovely place to stay: big fancy meals, big fancy drinks, big fancy beds. But what really sets the Chateau apart is their signature performer and courtesan: Marion Lavorre, the Ruby of the Sea. Her charms have delighted guests and clients for decades, but her performances are not long, and her private time is expensive. Many who drop by the Chateau for a meal or a drink therefore leave without getting to see her. Not wishing to resort to something as tacky as merchandise, the Chateau's management arrived at a way to give all guests a small taste, if you will, of the Ruby of the Sea experience. This special cocktail was designed to refresh and relax in equal measure, just like the Ruby herself."

There, enchantments allow the orchards and farmlands to be harvested year-round. With all foods in season at all times, the celebration of Wild's Grandeur in Vasselheim features heaps of fresh vegetables made into gorgeous dishes. One favorite treat is this succotash, a riot of colors and flavors that is traditionally served by the gallon from cauldrons; we've sized it down to a family portion that will fit in a skillet."

One of her favorite treats is crunchy bugs, such as these crickets. Now, both we and Yasha understand that not everyone is delighted by the idea of eating bugs. You can do this with chickpeas instead; they just take longer to dry. One other note: The spice mix isn't true to Moorland-style roasted crickets; rather, it's inspired by the way Yasha's bugs were served during Jester's elaborate magical feasts, an old childhood favorite given new life."
