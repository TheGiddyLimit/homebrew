								"In the foreword to the cookbook that ties into the world of {@i Game of Thrones}\u2014yep, such a book exists\u2014George R. R. Martin decided to reveal a secret. He admitted, in hushed tones, that he kind of... can't cook. \"There 'tis,\" he wrote, \"my shameful secret.\" He did, however, declare\u2014perhaps unnecessarily, as it's indisputable\u2014that he excels at writing. About food, too. So well about the latter, in fact, as to cause his readers to salivate profusely. {@i I have in the arsenal at my fingertips}, George announced in so many words, {@i what every writer truly needs:} \"Big, meaty nouns, crisp, fresh verbs, and a nice seasoning of adjectives and adverbs.\"",
								"I couldn't agree more. We may, nonetheless, take a moment to commiserate with Martin. He enjoys food\u2014as do I. This is obvious from his eminently Epicurean physique\u2014as is mine. But if he had a hankering for Dornish \"Duck with Lemons\" or \"Trout Wrapped in Bacon\" from the aforementioned cookbook, someone else would likely need to prepare them for him. He alone may not manage.",
								"As for myself\u2014to say it once and for all time\u2014I don't have this problem. Bah, in addition to savoring his words, I've done the same with the dishes from his world. I've already cooked the trout as well as the Dornish duck. I managed just fine with the \"Honeyed Chicken\" hailing from Winterfell, too. Next, I plan to make and serve the \"Quails Drowned in Butter\" from King's Landing. And I'm sure to go on to cook many other Westerosi dishes.",
								"Indeed, dear readers, I can cook. I know how to, and I enjoy doing it. And I don't mind boasting that there are few culinary mysteries to which I'm not privy. Wearing an apron, chef's knife in hand, I fear no creature, no fish, no fowl, no vegetable. It also seems I manage just fine with writing. My nouns aren't lean and dry, my adverbs are far from bland, and my adjectives, well, they're hardly of the garden variety. And when I write about food or its preparation, believe you me, I know the whats, hows, and whys. I'd say I'm thoroughly versed in them, in fact.",
								"I'm fully aware this book has more to do with the games than it does with {@i my} work, but I'd wager gamers retain an interest in fantasy literature\u2014in books and in how they come to be. But what the hell, this is my foreword, so I'll write what I please.",
								"A fundamental trait of the fantasy genre is something I like to call \"the realism of the unreal.\" As it describes worlds and events drawn from myth, legends, or fairy tales, {@i fantasy} breaks completely free of the fairy-tale paradigm, negating the unreal while simultaneously suspending rationality. It forces readers to immerse themselves in the world of a story and accept said world as real.",
								"My approach to making my fantasy neverland real was first and foremost through its economies. I was careful to shape economic issues to be both relevant and credible. Industries small and large, craftsmanship, farming, mining, trade and trade policies, monetary and fiscal mechanisms, banking, money, and financial operations\u2014I granted all these a prominent place in my \"unreality\" in order, in fact, to render it real. Because, even in our reality, what is more real than economies? People, be it in our world or fantasy worlds, have to make a living.",
								"And to live they must eat.",
								"I understood economics because I had made it my field of study. As to cooking\u2014I knew both how to do it and I liked doing it. To write about what one knows and what one enjoys... is there anything easier?",
								"All\u2014or nearly all\u2014of the culinary descriptions in my {@i Witcher} universe sprang from events in my own life. They're tied to memories\u2014oft of the nostalgic variety. And I wrote them, I admit, with the ignoble intent of eliciting a Pavlovian response in readers: to make their mouths water, their stomachs rumble.",
								"Take Queen Calanthe's feast in \"A Question of Price.\" Seated at a palace banquet table, Geralt wrestles with the shell of an enormous {@i ociężnik} (tran. crayfish or lobster). Hats off to any who know that {@i ociężnik} is an old Polish word for a langouste. Countless times I myself have wrestled with the shells of lobsters and other shellfish\u2014their bits taking to the air on many an occasion.",
								"In \"The Bounds of Reason,\" Geralt and Borkh Three Jackdaws treat themselves to some crayfish. It's a moment of personal culinary nostalgia. I have childhood memories going back, {@i ahem,} about seventy years... of large hauls of crustaceans and the feasts that followed. Hundreds of huge, red crayfish piled on tables, crayfish soup topped with crayfish croutons. I could go on... But those days are gone. As is {@i Astacus astacus}, the noble crayfish. For all practical purposes the species is extinct in our corner of Europe. If it hasn't vanished entirely just yet, the day fast approaches when it will.",
								"In the fifth novel of the {@i Witcher} series, {@i Lady of the Lake}, we have a feast hosted by Duchess Anarietta of Toussaint. At the center of the table lies an overgrown sterlet, a roasted heron on its back, a gold ring in the heron's beak. No, I won't pretend that I've ever prepared such a lavish display. Rather, I borrowed the roasted heron and the knightly vows made upon it from Maurice Druon's {@i The Accursed Kings}.",
								"But that table in Toussaint was also laden with mistle thrushes and fieldfares. Once hunted for sport, both these bird species are now protected. Serious hunters looked down on them as game. Yet they were eagerly hunted by youths wielding bolt-action rifles that took shells the size of cigarette filters, filled with shot the size of poppy seeds. You don't see rifles like this anymore, and to try these small fowl you must travel to Italy, where they're available in stores and served up at fine restaurants.",
								"I drew the crowning touch of the duchess's banquet, the {@i Magna bestia}\u2014a formidable roast moose\u2014from Zygmunt Gloger's {@i Old Polish Encyclopedia}. It is said this same dish was served at many a feast in Polish magnate homes. Annals contend that Stanisław Lubomirski, a nobleman, served something similar at a feast held during Polish-Swedish negotiations in 1635. I truly wonder how that looked. What's certain is that preparing a meal of this magnitude in today's kitchens would be simply impossible. Even in Sweden, where moose are still hunted and consumed.",
								"{@i Season of Storms,} too, incorporates its fair share of culinary curios. In the novel, Geralt makes his way to the {@i Natura Rerum}, an inn renowned for its kitchen. I compiled its menu from real recipes. As regards the \"Turbot in Squid Ink\" recommended to Geralt, I can claim to have made it myself, both ingredients being readily available these days. For anyone interested, turbot is a challenge to gut, clean, and fillet. But get it done, and you can look forward to something delicious.",
								"The sardines Dandelion and Geralt dine on in Kerack are a Portuguese specialty known as {@i sardinhas assadas.} While Milan, Italy, is where I had to go to find the fish soup Dandelion offers Geralt in the port. To cobble together this soup, one must invest a bit of effort and go to some trouble. The trouble is the tub gurnard, a fish from the {@i Triglidae} family. It's essential to the recipe, the soup is simply not the same without it.",
								"And then there's the dwarven rustic potato soup (Polish: {@i zalewajka}) described in one of Eleanor Rhundurin-Pigott's famed cookbooks. {@i Perfect Mahakaman Cuisine: The Precise Science of Preparing Meat, Fish and Vegetable Dishes}... is, mind you, a nonexistent book, entirely made up. To ask for it at a bookstore would be about as sensible as asking for a copy of the {@i Necronomicon}. That said, the soup itself is one hundred percent real. It's a traditional Polish soup, rooted in the times of our {@i Promised Land}{@cite Promised Land - Łódź|TWOC|*}, consumed as it was by the textile workers of the Scheibler, Geyer, and Poznański factories. The smell of {@i zalewajka} is the smell of the city of Łódź. It's the smell of my childhood, me, a second-generation {@i Lodzermensch}. The recipe as outlined in {@i Season of Storms} is, BTW, complete and accurate. It can easily be used to prepare the dish. Any capable and thrifty innkeeper could manage it.",
								"It was nice of the authors to honor my original recipe for \"{@recipe Mahakaman Zalewajka|TWOC}\" with a place in this book. I thank them both.",
								"I compiled quite a few fancy dishes\u2014some of them entirely made-up\u2014for the menu of the royal wedding feast in Kerack. I couldn't stop at oysters, sea urchins, sautéed crab, and sea bass with saffron, so I added \"Honeyed Knee of Swan.\" Chronicles of old tell of such \"knees\" being served in Moscow during the coronation banquet of the False Tsar Dmitriy I and his wife Marina Mniszech in 1606. {@i Se non è vero, è ben trovato.} Though they may have been tasty, I'd nevertheless advise leaving swans in peace.",
								"Aaand, almost forgot. I also added \"Grilled Honey-Browned Monkfish\" to the menu of the wedding feast at Kerack. It's a version of an actual dish. Those interested in trying it need only to google the recipe for \"Queue de lotte rôtie au balsamique et miel\" and have at it.",
								"At long last, dear readers, we come to {@i Baptism of Fire} and the fish soup that Geralt and his companions prepare and slurp down on an islet on the Yaruga River. The sheer number of times I've actually made this soup! In my kitchen at home, out in the wild, on fishing trips, on sunny days, under the stars, in rain and snow. In expensive Berghoff pots and in blackened, bubbling campfire cauldrons. I've made it from pike heads, carp, roach, perch, flounder, ruffe, North American catfish and God only knows what else. General rule: start by boiling fish trimmings in a vegetable broth. Strain that thoroughly and add the larger bits from gutting\u2014heads, tails, fins, spines, and bones\u2014to the strained broth. Cook it again to obtain a double broth, which you strain once more. Then add the \"edible\" fish bits\u2014meaning the pieces you actually want to eat\u2014to this strained double broth, and keep cooking to make a tripled-up soup. I'll refrain from listing specific herbs and spices, since {@i de gustibus} and so forth. Just season it richly and make it fiery. You may\u2014after the Hungarian fashion\u2014add a sizable portion of onion fried with good {@i edes fűszerpaprika}. I'll say it again\u2014the soup works just as well around a campfire as it does on a table set for a holiday.",
								"The recipe for \"{@recipe Redanian Fish Soup|TWOC}\" in this book fits nicely within the canon I've delineated. Give it a try\u2014it's worth it!",
								"But I've digressed enough\u2014high time to make something to eat. I think I'll try the \"{@recipe Fried Kaszanka with Egg|TWOC|Fried Kaszanka and Egg}\" described in this book. I get {@i kaszanka} (blood sausage) from my favorite store\u2014it's the real thick Łódź-style blood sausage. Egh, I pity the nations and regions that have never known a thick Łódź {@i kaszanka.} They go about their lives in blissful ignorance. As for mushrooms, I have them on hand\u2014penny buns and other boleti I forage from the Tuchola Forest and then dry. The added egg is, I admit, new to me... I've never had it with {@i kaszanka}. But it's worth trying everything you can, it's worth experimenting\u2014after all, the kitchen is no place for pedants. So I'll go ahead and slap an egg on my blood sausage\u2014call it a nod to the authors of this fine book.",
								"And on that optimistic note, I'll stop. I'm grabbing {@i The Witcher Official Cookbook} and heading to the kitchen."

						"You might not always notice the importance of food in pop culture products, but when culinary motifs are skillfully implemented in stories, they add much more than mere decoration. The finding, making, and eating of food provides relatable insight into a given world and its culture, and into the specific characters doing the finding, making, or eating. Thanks to this, universes gain layers, depth, and believability, promoting greater immersion among the audience. Culinary themes often serve as a backdrop to stories, setting the scene for plots to develop through dialogue and intrigue, or propelling the action forward through countless tavern quarrels and fight scenes during which characters use what's at hand in combat\u2014from cutlery, mugs, bowls, and bottles, to jars of preserve.",

When he lived with Yennefer she would occasionally throw jars of preserve at him in anger. Jars she had received from clients. Yennefer had no idea how to make preserve\u2014her magic was fallible in that respect."

						"In {@i The Witcher} stories\u2014whether written on the page and brought to life in the imagination or visualized on screen\u2014one encounters a familiar yet distorted world composed of various elements drawn from European folklore and culture. Slightly twisted versions of well-known fairy tales and legends, dropped into a fantasy setting, are a hallmark of {@i The Witcher}. These captivating reimaginings of classic stories we dimly remember from childhood form a rich background to the events and problems of the vivid, often morally ambiguous universe Geralt of Rivia explores.",
						"In creating this book, we followed a similar path. Drawing guidance and inspiration from the books and games that have captivated us, we also looked to the folklore and customs of our proverbial backyard, blending them with unique {@i Witcher} accents and a few new topical touches of our own. We allowed ourselves a bit of freedom due to our culinary leitmotif which we emphasized not only through accurately selected and \"placed\" recipes, but also with fictional stories of how our narrator learned them. We found creating these short tales, limited only by our imagination, to be both a joy and a tricky task as we had to adapt our research and inspirations in tasty, entertaining ways, all the while retaining the tone of the literary source.",
						"To tell our stories, we needed the right guide to take you on a journey through the cookbook's pages. Though we added a small sentimental surprise to the last chapter of the book, we deliberately let go of trying to step into a known character's shoes, be it Geralt or Dandelion, and having them, through their prism, lead you through the narrative. We shifted the burden of the story onto another set of shoulders.",
						"Our narrator is a new character, a cartographer from distant Kovir with a penchant for culinary exploration. She is the ideal candidate to be our guide across the Continent, traveling as a tourist with an outlander's perspective. In this sense, she is very much like we are. Because she hasn't been involved in any known previous events, she has the freedom to simply explore these newly visited lands and engage with their inhabitants. Though it may seem as if our narrator becomes embroiled in unusual situations rather often, we believe she credibly fits into the stylings, settings, and events of the expansive {@i Witcher} world. For it is this world's geographic diversity that influenced our book's composition, divided as it is into chapters dedicated to specific regions, each chapter leading you through a given stage of the narrator's journey.",
						{
							"type": "hr"
						},
						"The visual aspect of bringing these stories and recipes to life was equally crucial, thus we put all our passion and commitment into even the smallest detail to reflect the specificity of {@i the Witcher} world for its longtime fans and to showcase it to those just discovering it. We endeavored to capture the ambiance of each place through thematic illustrations, decorative ornaments and, above all, photographs. Some of these elements refer to cultures familiar to us, be it Scandinavian accents on the frosty Skellige Isles or the charming blend of French and Italian stylings as we move into Toussaint. Naturally, the narrator's visits to White Orchard and Velen simply had to feature references to our Polish roots, represented by colorful, regional folkloric elements and Slavic accents.",
						{

						"\"Something Ends, Something Begins\" is a fitting aphorism as our work on this cookbook comes to an end, while for you, dear reader, a culinary journey across the Continent begins. We sincerely hope that what we've produced will be warmly received as a worthy complement to the {@i Witcher} world. The story within strives to take you on a brief, somewhat sentimental journey. Yet you cannot fill your belly with words, so be brave and venture into your own kitchen with this book as your companion to experience for yourselves the rich, we daresay, diversity of flavors and aromas in the cuisine of the {@i Witcher} world."

						"Gaunter O'Dimm, known otherwise as the Man of Glass, proclaimed that in many matters, the culinary arts among them, time is the most important ingredient. It certainly is crucial for this cookbook. Just imagine the tempting smells of a hearty, warm, long-brewed stew served in a roadside tavern after a long journey, pleasantly appeasing your hunger and soothing the stresses of your day with each flavorful bite. So we encourage you to embrace that very concept and the carefree feeling you may get when you have a surfeit of it. Specifically, we encourage you to spend unhurried time in your kitchen enjoying the art of home cooking, and to celebrate time together over meals prepared in the {@i Witcher} style, with this cookbook as your companion.

We have in mind such things as dried herbs and spices, nuts, dried fruits, dried mushrooms, honey, apple cider vinegar, groats, oils, and flours.",

Most of these ingredients can be ordered online or found at specialized European delis or natural food markets.",

Extend the freshness of unused or extra herbs by storing as follows: sprinkle a doubled-up paper towel with water and wrap it around the fresh herbs. Put the wrapped herbs into a plastic bag, seal it, and refrigerate for up to two weeks.",

								"Use starchy, round potatoes rather than russet potatoes, which vary widely in size and shape.",

Sometimes we call for more uncommon equipment such as a potato masher, grater, fine-mesh strainer, whisk, tongs, wire rack, mortar and pestle (or you can use a food processor instead), basting or pastry brush, or ovenproof dish with lid. Although not available on the Continent, we also mention some modern conveniences such as electric ovens, aluminum foil, and plastic wrap.",

								"Good kitchen hygiene is essential. Use separate cutting boards for raw meats and clean them afterward with hot water. To sterilize jars for brining cucumbers or making sourdough, thoroughly wash lids and jars with dishwashing liquid and rinse with hot running water. Then place the jars and lids inside a large pot to prevent splashing or spilling, and pour boiling water over the lids and inside each jar twice. Use heatproof tongs to remove the lids and jars. Set them aside until they're fully dry.",

								"Store unused fresh yeast in the freezer. Crumble the yeast into an airtight container, cover, and freeze. When needed, measure the required amount of frozen crumbled yeast into a bowl and let sit at room temperature until thawed.",
								"When using flour, pay attention to hydration levels and refer to visual cues as per the instructions to make sure your dough has the right consistency. You can add more water if the dough is too dry or sprinkle in more flour if the dough is too moist.",
								"Don't waste any leftovers! For example, you can always throw some extra vegetables into any stew or use discarded leek parts to make a broth.",
								"Treat our recipes as guidance rather than as a strict set of rules. And remember to trust your senses. Following our tested recipes will give consistent results, but variations in the size or amount of any ingredients, the type of pan, stove, or oven, and other factors may slightly affect your results.",
								"We provide visual cues and photos for reference so that you can adjust heat and cooking times to get the desired level of browning, properly cooked meat, and tender but not overdone veggies; adjust the thickness of stews and soups by adding more water or broth to thin them, or simmering without a lid to thicken; adjust the balance of sour and sweet tastes to your liking by using more or less salt, spices, acids, or sweeteners."

								"The Continent is a colorful and intricate mosaic of lands, with the numerous variations and shades of its smaller parts combining to create an impressive pattern. It reminds me of a vibrant kitchen\u2014of intermingling tastes and intertwining smells, braided as cultures are across regions and localities in everyday life."

						"Every country has its customs, and every family has its traditions. Once upon a time, my relatives began regularly collecting kitchen notes\u2014about all sorts of dishes, from simple home recipes to those learned on journeys to far-off lands. Over many years, these loose pages turned into a bulging volume full of culinary family secrets handed down from generation to generation, a trove of priceless wealth holding traces of the past, present, and possibly the future\u2014so, a kind of eternity. It has always been a sentimental keepsake for me, a connection to the heart of my home: the kitchen and the family table there. This kitchen table\u2014thick and solid, made from sturdy oak, equipped with drawers and compartments\u2014may be a bit worn and a little cracked across its surface, but it has been a faithful family companion through everyday meals and evening feasts alike. It's an enchanted place where we are transported to various corners of the Continent ... both by tales languidly told and the flavors and smells of the dishes in our recipe collection.",
						"There was some space left in our family cookbook\u2014empty pages waiting to be filled with new recipes, ingredients, and culinary stories from beyond the environs of my home in Kovir. Until recently, I could only explore the world with the help of my family's abundant library of maps or my beloved books and volumes of poetry. My favorite among them has always been {@i The Blue Pearl} by Essi \"Oeillet\" Daven\u2014I draw inspiration from the author's beautifully written ballads, and her daring character gives me courage when I face the unknown. This would very much be so when it came time for me to step across my home's doorstep and open a new chapter in the family cookbook for my own journey\u2014a story that I would not have believed possible not long before.",
						"For there came a day when our mapmaking workshop received a commission ... straight from the ducal court of Toussaint, no less! We were to enrich the palace walls there with a tasteful rendering of the known world. There was nothing extraordinary about this in itself; for years, we have been sought out for the meticulous work we produce in our atelier. Occasionally, our expert drafters travel by merchant ship or caravan to clients' elegant halls and chambers to produce their intricate handicrafts on the spot. Yet for the first time, I was entrusted with representing the family and so accepted this invitation to travel due south\u2014from our workshop in Lan Exeter to the palace halls in Beauclair.",
						"At dawn, I boarded a merchant ship in Kovir and crossed the salty sea waves under fluttering sails. Arriving in the bustling port of Novigrad, however, I did not transfer to a vessel that would take me immediately to Beauclair, I simply could not deny myself the pleasure of visiting relatives who have lived within Vizima's walls for years. Nor could I forego the opportunity to extend my journey by several weeks with a view to exploring the neighboring lands and beyond ... Places I had hitherto known only from family tales, the details of which I had chiefly imagined, now lay before me as stops along my journey. I set out to taste new flavors and experience life in every town, village, and tavern I would have the good fortune to visit. I resolved that no mishaps nor even fateful surprises would make me stray from my chosen course, even were it to lead me to where the devil says goodnight...",
						"So I followed a trail of delicious foods around the Continent. As my grandpapa is wont to say, the proof of the pudding is in the eating. Rest assured, I did so with gusto, be it along the sandy tracks of the Northern Realms or on the Skelige Isles' frosty, windy shores. And, eventually, indeed, in Toussaint's sun-warmed valleys, at once verdant and golden, amidst the fairy-tale beauty that reigns there.",
						"Though ingredients and recipes were without a doubt my chief interest throughout my journey, the culinary arts draw folk of all sorts. Thus, I also gathered, or at times just overheard, the stories, gossip, and rumors of those who dined beside me. They were travelers and local folk\u2014from fatigued royal messengers and dignified officials, through halfling scholars, carefree bards, and dwarven merchants, to even the occasional assimilated elf. And if innkeepers are to be believed in the rumors they proffer, their patrons at times included more mysterious figures oft concealed beneath hoods\u2014mages, sorceresses, or the monster slayers known as witchers...",

								"To satisfy these longings I needed but a bit of courage. Having found this, I went on to enjoy the culinary wonders of distant lands and to discover with my own palate positively captivating recipes offering flavorful surprises.",
								"Previously hidden in far-away corners of the world, I have brought them home. Carefully recorded in my journal, I share these secrets now from my beloved family's kitchen."

						"Emerging from a literal maze of paths and shallow levees, I found myself standing at a crossroads\u2014the first sign that I had reached Velen. In this land, wooden chapels line the roads, guiding travelers along their way like eerie will-o'-the-wisps. Guarded by the old oak Rarog, king of the local forest, the crossing reeked of damp that had wafted in from the region's mist-shrouded swamps. Unsurprisingly, local superstition holds this scrap of land to be teeming with mysterious netherworldly forces. But for some wayfarers, a different face of Velen peers through the haze of dust churned up by horses' hooves: one speckled with wooden cottages, tidy pastures and fields cultivated by generations of persistent farmers. Over time, villages in the region began to exchange goods and wares in a show of neighborly support, much to the benefit of Velen's simple cuisine. Once limited in terms of ingredients, dishes throughout the region soon evolved, while ever retaining enough unique rustic flavor to invigorate and delight any city-dweller's palate. And though Velen has for years battled vile gossip and blows to a reputation now darker than the devil himself, it is worth putting such whispered tales aside to stop at the Inn at the Crossroads, or to dine at a local family's table, so as to experience the region's warm hospitality.",

								"Folk wisdom cautions us to hope for the best yet be ever ready for the worst\u2014which in my case proved to be the fickle and changeable weather I encountered in Midcopse. A sudden downpour drove me to the local ealdorman's door. The kind-hearted host and his wife invited me to stay for a meal. As regional custom would have it, \"Guests in the house are gods in the house.\" Their humble dwelling stood fragrant with resinous wood, dust, and a savory golden decoction bubbling enticingly on the whitewashed stove. The cottage's wooden shutters and beams groaned softly as the wet weather outside heightened my desire for a few sips of what I hoped would prove a delicious, warming soup. As it turned out, the hearty broth of meat, vegetables, and herbs owed its flavor to the vegetables being roasted and to a splash of vinegar. Served with a generous helping of tender noodles made by the ealdorman's wife, the soup's aroma whisked me back to my grandmother's cozy homestead, a memory I will forever hold dear.",

								"Folk tales of birds abound in the North, and Velen proved no exception. Storks nesting on rooftops or swallows building dwellings within homestead walls are not pests, but marks of good fortune. A sharp eye, however, will note that alongside such lucky omens many buildings bear the scars of raids and wars. Yet these less peaceful and less prosperous times gave rise to some beloved local recipes as well. Their hand forced by circumstance, resourceful locals from Lindenvale and nearby villages nonetheless concocted filling dishes using only the simplest ingredients. For example, this sauerkraut and pea stew. Customarily boiled in a large cauldron, the rich stew is meant to last for days. It is oft served with dumplings or bread, while in happier, more abundant years it is enriched with bacon. In Velen, in these times, one might find a small, scrumptious portion left out in a clay pot for household sprites\u2014kind imps that, in exchange for food and shelter, come nightfall help with daily chores.",

In the case of the Crossroads 'twas a lucky charm fashioned from a piece of a hanged man's rope! The rumor was that the innkeep's relatives would dip the rope into the roasted grain infusion, believing that whosoever tasted a drink thus \"seasoned\" would be certain to return for another round.

At the time of my visit, the hut's occupant was Yagna, who had a black rooster as her companion and clearly no patience as a cook. While ferreting through items left behind by a sorceress predecessor of hers (some signed by \"Keira M.\" in an elegant hand), Yagna had discovered a recipe for an exquisite beef stew.

Until our chance meeting, that is. I never travel without a collection of critical provisions and have never seen any reason not to share my knowledge. So I imparted a few kitchen tips and shared several sachets straight from the Zerrikanian Spice Company in Novigrad, and soon I had turned from Yagna's unannounced guest into her culinary savior.

A fragrant dish of browned cabbage leaves wrapped around a savory filling of barley, meat, and mushrooms, the rolls were served topped with a velvety dill cream sauce. The conversation {@i à table} revolved around recent scientific achievements at the Academy, art gallery openings, and paintings by old masters and rising stars alike\u2014a topic about which the guests from the auction house were especially excited. Of course, there was no avoiding the Vegelbuds' boasting about their most recent acquisitions for their many estates. I thus heard quite a bit of praise for my family's craft. Suddenly, I was inundated with requests from the other guests wishing to take advantage of my presence! So I employed a strategy of polite yet tight-lipped answers and sought mostly to hide behind my plate ... the better to enjoy its delectable contents.",

The feast included a special wedding dessert called a {@i korowaj}, in this case served, not quite in line with tradition, in the form of smaller buns. The fluffy yeast-leavened buns made from milk, eggs, honey, and butter hid a smooth cheese filling enriched with dried fruit bits soaked in mead. When preparing this treat, it is traditionally good practice to use water drawn from seven rivers and milk from the best cow in the village.

The largest trading port on any shore of the Great Sea, the Free City of Novigrad stands proudly astride the Pontar River delta in the kingdom of Redania. There, breezes from the docks and fish market mingle with the rich smell of spices and pastries from market stalls. Together, they create a tangle of sweet-and-salty aromas that crisscross like trade winds in the city's muddy alleys and cobbled streets. These tendrils of scent meander past granaries, port cranes and soaring tenements housing powerful merchant and craft guilds. Finally, they reach the heart of the city\u2014the bustling market square. If it's a feast you seek, the Golden Sturgeon, the Kingfisher, the Spear Blade and the acclaimed Chameleon are happy to oblige. In each of these establishments, troubadours' ballads blend with the clinking of gold coins and pewter cups. And they are just a few of the many eateries, taverns, inns and canteens that entice visitors.

When those craggy cliffs emerged from the mist at long last, I knew I had reached my destination\u2014a refuge anchored firmly amidst the swirling storm. I had been fortunate. The waves of the Great Sea surrounding the Skellige Isles are notoriously fickle guides for merchant ships from afar and local longships alike, known to the islanders as drakkars. For most inhabitants of the Continent, this archipelago off the coasts of Verden and Cintra might well be the edge of the world, a strange place shrouded in myth and legend. Though the Isles are indeed difficult to reach, once you arrive, the fog of superstition lifts quickly and you discover a land that is home to numerous proud, independent clans and many a boundless, breathtaking vista. From my brief time walking those rocky shores and heathered trails\u2014gazing at cloud-draped mountains, snow-capped peaks and cliffsides swarmed by squawking gulls\u2014I came to realize that the harsh conditions of the archipelago spare none. Not least a landlubber like myself. With windburned cheeks and frozen bones comes a wolfish appetite\u2014something easily remedied in one of Skellige's many taverns. Often, while warming myself by a crackling fire, I learned just how many of their dishes celebrate the bounty of the sea.

Before long, I was enjoying the savory aroma and flavor of their signature meat-and-spinach patties served with fried miniature cabbages and a thick blueberry-plum jam.

As I helped myself to a serving, topped with melted cheese, honey-caramelized apple, and a spicy horseradish sauce, I eavesdropped on a group of matrons, scolding their brood nearby.

Roasted buckwheat, tender meat, and onion, beneath a thick smothering of mustard-cheese sauce ... By the gods ... With my belly full and my body warmed, the festive fervor took hold of me, too.

An idyllic enclave for common folk, nobility and palace visitors alike, it is where drink and dance flow seemingly without end.

The Toussantois serve wine alongside all meals, in ornamental chalices, of course, but also use it as an ingredient in many of the duchy's traditional dishes. The region's cuisine is, quite simply, artistry on a fork. Even specialties enjoyed mostly by the common rabble are treasured and desired by the duchy's nobility and wellborn. And, as I expected, revels within the city walls grow to new heights of lavishness as holidays approach, be it {@i Yule}, {@i Belleteyn} or, perhaps most importantly, the Festival of the Vat.

While at the library, with the court librarian's aid, I familiarized myself with its vast collection of maps. My aim was to draft the most accurate representation of the Continent to date. While consulting with the chamberlain, I was surprised to hear that my pace of work and apparent academic fervor might prove a disruption to the palace's serene air. \"'Work doth one ennoble,'\" he said, \"'while sloth doth one gratify'\u2014a local mantra, if you will.

While working in the palace library, I was fortunate enough to meet a group of future architects, all Beauclair natives. They became my guides and dining companions, introducing me to some of the best eateries tucked away in the city's nooks and corners. And so it happened that my boisterous new comrades, enthusiasts of the famed architect Faramond, led me to the Pheasantry\u2014a culinary and cultural experience {@i de rigueur}. I encouraged them to draw on their local wisdom and choose for me a dish that, to their minds, would capture the tavern's spirit. So I promptly sampled the Pheasantry's exquisitely aromatic beef stew\u2014simmered with sautéed mushrooms, carrots, and onions, and further enriched with plums, the inn's secret ingredient. Served with a creamy potato purée, the stew proved worthy of its reputation and more. After the meal, my comrades and I moved to a table on the terrace, taking our as yet unemptied bottles of wine with us. There, we witnessed the exciting conclusion of the Great Beauclair Gwent Tournament. Truth be told, I was disappointed to see the grand finale of this tourney of wits turn into a crude brawl. Yet, as my companions casually noted, I had at least experienced Toussaint's \"true culture\" firsthand.",

Thus, on that day, I could be seen emerging from a hedge bush\u2014hair tousled, tunic rumpled\u2014proudly presenting a pheasant feather I had been tasked with finding. Accomplishing the feat meant I could attempt the next. Following the clue attached to the feather, I reached a bakery in Lolivier Square.

As I kneaded the ground almonds into my pastry dough, I nibbled on pears coated in a caramel sauce made with exquisite Est Est white wine and Zerrikanian spices. First attempt though it was, I managed to produce a perfect tart. The evaluating confectioner praised it highly, ensuring that I passed to the game's next stage.

As you might imagine, I spent most of my time in his kitchen, the air thick with the aroma of fresh herbs. Much like in my own home in Kovir, his kitchen was the favored meeting place for members of his household. His family taught me about new ingredients and recipes, and we spent much time debating the merits of using precise measurements as opposed to following one's instincts and cooking with dollops and dashes, splashes and handfuls. Naturally, I lent a hand where I could, better to penetrate the secrets of their family recipes. It was there that I learned to prepare duck confit\u2014a dish that takes time but rewards handsomely those with some patience.

Among these was their ever-popular gingerbread, based on the recipe of legendary elven chef Ra'mses Gor-Thon, for which a spot is always made on Beauclairois tables during the observance of {@i Midinváerne}. While waiting to collect my own gingerbread, I studied the original written recipe, on display inside a glass case, as well as the famous spoon key to the door of the legendary chef's workshop. The Pheasantry had drawn a crowd that day. I acquired two gingerbread loaves and took a smaller piece on a tasting plate to eat on the terrace under the Toussaint sun. As I sat, having my cake and eating it, too, I began reading a book of fairy tales I had procured at the market earlier that day. It was titled {@i Tales of the Merchant of Mirrors}. How amusing and appropriate, I thought, that the book provided such interesting perspectives on time as a culinary concept.

To taste and learn the differences between the {@i haute cuisine} of Toussaint's capital, Beauclair, and the lands beyond its walls, one need but stroll along the Sansretour River, accompanied by a chorus of cicadas. Unsure of one's path, one can always inquire with the knights-errant who regularly patrol these routes.

								"Kissel is a gooey, ruby-colored ostensible dessert with bits of cranberry, raspberry, and cherry. I was able to sample it at the Cockatrice Inn, where it tickled my taste buds so thoroughly that it came to deserve its own entry in my journal. It proved intriguing not just due to its sweet-yet-sour flavor, derived from the combination of ripe fruit with a base of red wine, but also through its unconventional use in the local cuisine. While you will find cranberry kissel served solely as a dessert on Redanian tables, in Toussaint chefs tend to approach cooking more as an art than a craft. So they use kissel as a sauce to accompany various savory dishes. Not least among them, the hare pâté I was served at the Cockatrice.",

								"The walk from the Cockatrice Inn to the Corvo Bianco vineyard was pleasant, even in the sweltering heat of the day. I was eager to sample the vineyard's wine, true, but above all to exchange a few words with its extraordinary owner. For Corvo Bianco belongs to Geralt of Rivia himself, the famous White Wolf, a witcher whose exploits are known throughout the Northern Realms, from Kovir in the far north to the Amell Mountains (and, as it turned out, beyond them) in the south. Apart from meeting the legendary monster-slayer in person, I hoped to ask him about a peculiar journal I had acquired in Oxenfurt. Sadly, I would be disappointed. When at last I arrived at the vineyard, its exceedingly polite majordomo informed me that its owner was not expected to return for weeks at the least, if not until the end of autumn, just before the first heavy snows would block the mountain passes. Crestfallen, I nonetheless accepted the majordomo's invitation to rest my weary legs. I spent a few hours in the shade of a rose-covered arbor, sipping lemonade squeezed from ripe lemons, then blended with the juice of freshly picked white grapes. This delicious mixture, common in the region, is customarily served as a refreshment during the grape harvest. Meanwhile, I listened to a story about the origins of the vineyard and the famed Sepremento wine it had once produced, and of how Geralt of Rivia came to be the property's owner, transforming the run-down estate into a once more respected and prospering one. Only once the fiery sunset had given way to the evening's cool palette did I bid farewell to Corvo Bianco's hospitality and turn my gaze and steps toward Beauclair's city gates. I did not doubt the majordomo regarding Geralt of Rivia's prolonged absence. Yet as I strode down the road I secretly hoped one of the travelers I passed would turn out to be a white-haired man with two swords on his back.",

Trapped in the city and unable to embark on the next stage of my journey, I have accepted an offer from the antique shop of an auction house to restore an old map of unknown provenance. I was working in the shop the other day when an old, weathered, leather-bound journal caught my eye. The antique dealer acquired it shortly after the Battle of Brenna, and it allegedly belonged to a fallen witcher named Coën, as evidenced by the former owner's initials inscribed inside the front cover. The surviving entries are so illegible and incomplete as to be very difficult to decipher. So it has been gathering dust in the antique shop for years, classified rather as a curio than a valuable artifact that could become the object of a vigorous bidding contest.

Add the onion, carrot, and parsley root and continue to simmer until the meat becomes soft and starts to fall off the bones, about 1 hour more. About 15 minutes before the end of cooking, add 2 tsp salt and stir gently.",
				"Meanwhile, rinse the mushrooms with cold water, place in a small bowl, cover with lukewarm water, and let soak for 40 minutes. Strain and reserve the soaking water. Set mushrooms aside.",
				"Strain the meat and vegetables, reserving the stock, and let cool. When the hare legs and chicken leg are lukewarm, pull the meat from the bones. Discard the bones, skin, bay leaves, allspice berries, and peppercorns. Transfer the meat to a big bowl, along with the cooked vegetables and bacon, and set aside.",
				"In a separate small bowl, combine the bread with some of the reserved stock and let soak for 20 minutes. Then drain the bread, squeeze out the excess liquid, and add to the bowl with the meat and vegetables.",
				"Trim and discard any connective tissue and fat residue from the livers, halve the larger livers so all the pieces are of similar size, and then pat dry with paper towels.",
				"In a medium nonstick skillet over medium-high heat, warm the vegetable oil. Add the livers and cook until browned, about 2 minutes. Then, using tongs, flip the livers (being careful not to puncture them) and cook for 2 minutes more. Turn the heat to low, add the drained mushrooms and 1 to 2 Tbsp of their soaking water, stir, and continue to cook until the water has evaporated, about 2 minutes more. Turn off the heat, season with a pinch each of salt and pepper, transfer the livers and mushrooms to the bowl with the meat and vegetables, and let cool to room temperature.",
				"When the ingredients have cooled, pass the meat-vegetable mixture through a meat grinder three times or, using a food processor, pulse the mixture until it has a smooth, uniform consistency, like a thick purée. Transfer the meat mixture to a bowl; add the parsley, marjoram, ginger, nutmeg, 1 tsp salt, and 1 tsp pepper; and, using a fork, mix thoroughly. Taste and season with additional salt and spices, if desired; it should be well seasoned at this point. Add the egg yolks and stir to incorporate.",
				"Preheat the oven to 350°F / 180°C. Line a 9 by 5-inch / 23 by 13cm loaf pan or terrine with parchment paper or grease with vegetable oil. Sprinkle with bread crumbs.",
				"Place the egg whites in a medium metal bowl, add a pinch of salt, and, using a whisk, whip into stiff peaks.",
				"Using a spatula, gently fold the egg whites into the meat mixture. Check the consistency; it should be well combined and moist but not runny\u2014a good indicator is if you hear squelching sounds when you tap the top with your fingers. If it's too dry, stir in the chicken stock as needed; if it's too moist, sprinkle in some bread crumbs. Transfer the mixture to the prepared pan, and then, using your palm, flatten the top.",
				"Bake the pâté for 15 minutes. Then turn the oven temperature to 300°F / 150°C and continue baking until golden brown on top, 60 to 70 minutes. If the top begins to get too brown, cover it with a piece of parchment paper or aluminum foil. At the end of baking, poke a wooden skewer into the middle of the pâté\u2014if the skewer comes out clean, the pâté is ready; if not, continue cooking for a few minutes more.",
				"Let the pâté cool to room temperature, then run a knife around the edges and invert onto a cutting board or serving plate. It can be served right away, but if refrigerated overnight, it will become firmer and will have a richer flavor. Serve with slices of freshly baked bread."

Just like old times ... we started with nip glasses of something strong and an appetizer from the house larder. My companions had prepared the favored snack of busy academics such as themselves: crunchy cucumbers brined with garlic, dill, and horseradish, as per the tried-and-true Oxenfurt Drinker's Club recipe. Our samplings of liquors, pickled tidbits and lard-smeared bread soon inspired a round of \"Ne'er Have I Ever,\" during which I detailed my unfortunate nekker-occasioned loss of Leftover Potato Bread in Velen\u2014to peals of laughter, I might add."

Alas, due to overfishing in the region, sturgeon had become a delicacy reserved for special occasions. So instead, I enjoyed the dish prepared with common trout. And yet ... through this unique, salt-heavy roasting method, the trout's flavor was anything but common. Delicious, tender, juicy flesh with the fragrant aromas of dill, butter, pepper, and lemon\u2014the plate's lone exotic ingredient, imported from the warmest corners of the Continent. Although the fish and salad delighted me with perfect balance, the salt crust delighted all others at my table.

Once baked, the flatbreads are served with honey, jam or cottage cheese, as is one's preference. Sitting on the fishing pier with my own batch later that morning, I enjoyed my delicious snack and the lake's calm surface, deep beneath which a water nymph is said to languish, unhappily in love with a human being.

Also, the mere varieties, vintages, and barrels on display around the dining room did wonders to arouse my curiosity.

Yet amongst all the flavor profiles I sampled, I crowned the sangria as queen cup of the evening. It is made using a unique blend of red wine, spices and sun-ripened fruit, including raspberries, blueberries, strawberries, and citruses, all of local provenance. Though most folk enjoy it as a cool refreshment on sweltering days, the barmaid explained, this fact need not mean the sangria loses its appeal come nightfall. Bottles came and went. I only noticed the time that had passed when the tavernkeep announced last call and I realized nearly all other patrons had long departed. Belly full and soul satisfied, I set out for the palace. I felt profoundly confident, at ease in my new surroundings, as if the sangria had given me almost limitless courage. Had the ghost of a headless knight errant appeared before me, I might well have asked him for a ride. Unfortunately, contrary to common belief, I've found that knights\u2014spectral or otherwise\u2014rarely appear when most needed. So I passed through the slumbering city, through the market square, and across the bridge between Old Town and the palace, the scent of blooming roses my sole companion..."

Apart from meeting the legendary monster-slayer in person, I hoped to ask him about a peculiar journal I had acquired in Oxenfurt. Sadly, I would be disappointed. When at last I arrived at the vineyard, its exceedingly polite majordomo informed me that its owner was not expected to return for weeks at the least, if not until the end of autumn, just before the first heavy snows would block the mountain passes. Crestfallen, I nonetheless accepted the majordomo's invitation to rest my weary legs. I spent a few hours in the shade of a rose-covered arbor, sipping lemonade squeezed from ripe lemons, then blended with the juice of freshly picked white grapes. This delicious mixture, common in the region, is customarily served as a refreshment during the grape harvest. Meanwhile, I listened to a story about the origins of the vineyard and the famed Sepremento wine it had once produced, and of how Geralt of Rivia came to be the property's owner, transforming the run-down estate into a once more respected and prospering one. Only once the fiery sunset had given way to the evening's cool palette did I bid farewell to Corvo Bianco's hospitality and turn my gaze and steps toward Beauclair's city gates. I did not doubt the majordomo regarding Geralt of Rivia's prolonged absence. Yet as I strode down the road I secretly hoped one of the travelers I passed would turn out to be a white-haired man with two swords on his back."

				"A settlement on the archipelago's southernmost isle, Faroe, was the final stop on my tour of Skellige. Though many of my fellow travelers decided to remain on board, I chose to visit Harviken and peek inside the island's sole tavern, a quaint spot tucked between two homesteads. As I walked past a group of apparent regulars, I glanced at the fare before them. The tavernkeep insisted I try a dish that would be \"safe for an outsider's gut,\" yet I had already set my eyes on a prize. In the end, I sat down with a plate of hard-fought herring in oil. Cranberries, pickled onions, colored peppercorns, and dill rounded off the dish nicely. Served with hearty bread to wipe up any remaining oil, this outsider left no flavor to waste."

Upon my arrival in Flovive, I decided, as usual, to sample the local cuisine while watching a musicians' parade inaugurate the festivities. At the Barrel and Bung, they served flamiche, a dish that has been the villagers' pride for years and, like everything in Toussaint, has a story behind its inception. It apparently all began with an unfortunate mishap. As a Tufo vineyard worker's wife was entering the village square, she tripped and fell, causing the eggs, cheese, and cream in her basket to blend together. A friend came to her aid and suggested they rescue the mess by removing any eggshells and baking the mish-mashed ingredients with the bread dough the friend had been kneading. The current version of flamiche enriches the traditional base of fluffy dough with its creamy filling by adding leeks stewed in local white wine. The dish is enjoyed both as a snack and as a main meal in many households throughout the duchy."

The proprietress had explained how to achieve the unpretentious yet rich flavor\u2014by grinding plenty of local greens, seeds, and oils into a paste, then toasting this with the bread and topping each warm batch with grated, mature cheese. This modest meal, often enjoyed by local workers, originates from the village of Fox Hollow, where it remains a popular choice at the Ruddy Brush Auberge. When I returned the empty basket to its owner, she invited me to sit down to an evening feast. Seated on empty wine crates and sampling appetizers made from local produce, we listened to a wandering storyteller recount some local folktales, including one about a black cat that granted seven wishes and another about a brilliant rat that ran Beauclair's most prestigious tavern, creating culinary wonders from the simplest ingredients."

At a baker's stall, the talkative owner explained the cause of the commotion whilst selling sandwiches to all those waiting. The troublemaker was apparently a squire named Pierre Gynt, who had journeyed to Mount Gorgon and the legendary Hall of the Mountain King to retrieve a jewel for his cherished mademoiselle. Pierre had returned from the cave not with a jewel, but with a curse that blighted the village with mysterious disappearances. Whatever had followed the young squire back, it no doubt complicated my plan to return to the capital. But, as my beloved nana always said, \"Just as a cat cannot lay eggs, a man cannot move a mountain.\" I decided not to fight the circumstances and to wait for the situation to resolve itself. I passed the time by chatting with the baker and sampling his open-faced baguettes. He proudly emphasized that the various toppings were his original ideas, such as creamy camembert, caramelized onions, and nuts, all on toast, or the soft bread with fresh tuna, egg, and herb paste. His opinion of the knights-errant and their handling of the present situation was far less enthusiastic. \"Those pompous twits? Only good for jousts and tourneys, I say.

One such recipe, the Golden Sturgeon's zander in thyme, served in a skillet with a creamy sauce of stewed leeks and white wine, has won recognition among the inn's regular clientele and become a staple of the menu.

Yet, through a twist of fate, I arrived during a local celebration, a time when Ard Skelligers honor the founding of their clan and family seat. As legend has it, eons ago the hero Grymmdjarr carved the castle out of seaside rock with his bare hands. So as not to anger the gods, he refused hospitality to none, leaving the door of the feast hall open at all times for natives and foreigners alike. And so, in honor of the old tradition, the door stood open for me when I arrived. Inside the feast hall, the tables overflowed with mead, roasted meats, fish, and countless other fruits of the sea. Out of the corner of my eye, I spotted a sumptuous roast ham. Thin slices had been carved from it and set atop bread rolls. As I helped myself to a serving, topped with melted cheese, honey-caramelized apple, and a spicy horseradish sauce, I eavesdropped on a group of matrons, scolding their brood nearby. They told the story of a witch near Fornhala who taints cakes with spells. Greedy, sweet-toothed children who partake of the cakes turn into exceptionally shaggy bears for the rest of their days..."

Yet the sweet objects of desire are said to be guarded by the sinister Ladies of the Wood, out to snare the more mischievous of the children. How did such an unusual custom arise among the inhabitants of the recently rebuilt village? And do the evil Crones of remote Crookback Bog actually snatch children wandering down the sweet-lined path? The stories surrounding this custom fade as time passes and change as they migrate to distant places. In one instance they are said to have inspired a folk tradition whereby villagers dress up in costumes fashioned from straw! Imagine! Yet, well-seasoned reader of stories that I am, I can say even the most improbable story almost always contains a grain of truth."

Among these was their ever-popular gingerbread, based on the recipe of legendary elven chef Ra'mses Gor-Thon, for which a spot is always made on Beauclairois tables during the observance of {@i Midinváerne}. While waiting to collect my own gingerbread, I studied the original written recipe, on display inside a glass case, as well as the famous spoon key to the door of the legendary chef's workshop. The Pheasantry had drawn a crowd that day. I acquired two gingerbread loaves and took a smaller piece on a tasting plate to eat on the terrace under the Toussaint sun. As I sat, having my cake and eating it, too, I began reading a book of fairy tales I had procured at the market earlier that day. It was titled {@i Tales of the Merchant of Mirrors}. How amusing and appropriate, I thought, that the book provided such interesting perspectives on time as a culinary concept. For time is a crucial ingredient, giving gingerbread the right consistency, conjuring the ideal crunch of the outer crust and the delicious moistness within."

After all, the Empire's borders were continually expanding to include an ever-growing list of culinary traditions. The officer treated me to more stories as we emptied more glasses of the golden liquid.

A sharp eye, however, will note that alongside such lucky omens many buildings bear the scars of raids and wars. Yet these less peaceful and less prosperous times gave rise to some beloved local recipes as well. Their hand forced by circumstance, resourceful locals from Lindenvale and nearby villages nonetheless concocted filling dishes using only the simplest ingredients. For example, this sauerkraut and pea stew. Customarily boiled in a large cauldron, the rich stew is meant to last for days. It is oft served with dumplings or bread, while in happier, more abundant years it is enriched with bacon. In Velen, in these times, one might find a small, scrumptious portion left out in a clay pot for household sprites\u2014kind imps that, in exchange for food and shelter, come nightfall help with daily chores."

Each occupant, when moving into the cottage and inheriting the items and supplies previous tenants had left behind, assumed the role of \"hedge witch,\" who local folk could turn to with their troubles. At the time of my visit, the hut's occupant was Yagna, who had a black rooster as her companion and clearly no patience as a cook. While ferreting through items left behind by a sorceress predecessor of hers (some signed by \"Keira M.\" in an elegant hand), Yagna had discovered a recipe for an exquisite beef stew. Yet her hungry ambition to sample the recipe's promised fusion of dry Zurbarràn wine and Zerrikanian spices seemed doomed to go unsatisfied, so chaotic were her attempts at it. Until our chance meeting, that is. I never travel without a collection of critical provisions and have never seen any reason not to share my knowledge. So I imparted a few kitchen tips and shared several sachets straight from the Zerrikanian Spice Company in Novigrad, and soon I had turned from Yagna's unannounced guest into her culinary savior.

Alas, as this unscheduled stop was due to be brief, we did not venture beyond the local tavern, where we travelers had accompanied our captain. I was immediately struck by the presence of local trappers, their trophies abundantly adorning the walls. I knew immediately the folk of Spikeroog would have more to offer than fish. Before long, I was enjoying the savory aroma and flavor of their signature meat-and-spinach patties served with fried miniature cabbages and a thick blueberry-plum jam. Meanwhile, at the neighboring table, villagers familiar with the archipelago's dangers advised our captain to take a new route to avoid both rough seas and sea monsters that prowl the waves."

A herald, voice clear and booming, announced the start of a spectacle\u2014a play to be staged in the ruins of the Seidhe Llygad Amphitheatre. It was rumored a theater troupe had sought to perform a controversial work with a vampire motif. Yet at the behest of the ducal court, the Imperial Academy of Drama had stepped in with a staging of {@i A Midsummer Night's Daydream}. Market stalls usually used by local artists to sell their paintings promptly disappeared from the square. They were replaced with tables and with crates filled with Vis la Crac wine. While I strolled through the milling crowd, restless with anticipation, I came across a small confectionary stand, the proprietor inviting passersby to sample his fare. Given the commotion of the festival, he explained, he had pared down his offerings to a simplified take on his popular honey croissants with plum filling. Yet, the baker assured me, these were of no lesser quality. I left the busy Gran'place Market, croissants in hand, and found a quiet nook on a side street. There, I put his claims to the test. Indeed, in the mild sweetness, buttery flakes, and delicate crispiness, I found absolutely no flaw."

This sticky situation aside, my journey passed uneventfully. Upon my arrival at the Seven Cats, I ordered a deep dish of the unusual decoction, tiptoeing to a table so as not to spill even a drop of the fragrant liquid. The tangy, greenish pickled cucumber broth was rounded out with pieces of delicate meat, creamy potatoes, sweet carrots, and a dash of aromatic dill.

Though she in truth had been collecting wild plants from roadside ditches, it was sorrel, not nettles, she was gathering for a nourishing recipe. The green-hued soup she aimed to make based on a pork-rib broth was for her brother. He had been cursed, and no one had thus far found a remedy. The poor wretch was forced to seek seclusion in a cemetery and await meals brought by his family, who would announce their arrival with the clanging of spoons hung on a string. Though the pungent, green broth initially repulsed me, the story nevertheless inspired me to include this sorrel soup recipe in my journal.

				"Soon after arriving in Beauclair, I presented myself at the palace so as to begin work on a cartographic project commissioned by the ducal court. In preparation for it, I first consulted its scope and purpose with the court chamberlain, then made frequent visits to the renowned Beauclair Library. While at the library, with the court librarian's aid, I familiarized myself with its vast collection of maps. My aim was to draft the most accurate representation of the Continent to date. While consulting with the chamberlain, I was surprised to hear that my pace of work and apparent academic fervor might prove a disruption to the palace's serene air. \"'Work doth one ennoble,'\" he said, \"'while sloth doth one gratify'\u2014a local mantra, if you will. And for us Beauclarois, gratification is sacred!\" Thus, while continuing to make visible progress in my map-making, I allowed myself ample moments of sloth as well. Come my first evening free of toil, I embarked on an exploration of the local cuisine at one of the city's many taverns\u2014The Adder and Jewels. Affiliated with a winery, the establishment was housed in a townhouse cellar and came highly recommended by courtiers and palace servants alike. The wine list was impressive, while the dishes based on the recipes of the legendary elven chef Ra'mses Gor-Thon proved more than a match. Gor-Thon's once-lost culinary legacy had been rediscovered years before. The tavernkeep who came into possession of his records had incorporated the chef-of-yore's last surviving recipes into the menu. As I pored over it, I found myself torn between the Étoile Blanche Pasta and a crayfish boil. In the end, my passion for noodles proved decisive. The wide ribbons were served with a range of tasty additions\u2014fried turkey marinated in exotic spices and yogurt, aromatic chanterelles, sweet tomatoes, a handful of arugula, and a creamy ricotta cheese. Paired with a red wine from the Pomerol Vineyard, it proved the very gratification I had set out to find."
