				"This trap requires a spellcaster to carve a specific sequence of Abyssal runes into a doorframe using demon blood and diamond dust. The person who carves the runes chooses a passphrase in Abyssal. When the passphrase is spoken aloud (whispering counts) within 15 feet of the door, the trap is rendered inert for 1 minute.",
				"When the final rune is carved, the sequence fades into the doorframe. The runes can be spotted with a DC 15 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check, but a character can feel the runes if it runs its hand along the frame and succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check. A character who knows Abyssal can determine the passphrase with a DC 15 Intelligence check, though sometimes the passphrase is more difficult to discover and a clever carver may hide it in a riddle within the runes. Dealing 50 damage to the door's frame renders the trap inert until it is repaired. The AC for the doorframe depends on the material of which it is made (wood AC 15, stone AC 17, metal AC 19).",
				"Any non-fiend creature who walks through the door triggers the trap. The creature is transported into a random area of the Abyss and witnesses unspeakable horror. That creature must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save it takes 55 ({@dice 10d10}) psychic damage. On a success it takes half damage. The creature returns on the side of the doorframe from which it entered at the end of its next turn."

At the start of the round when the room becomes too narrow for a creature (once the walls are touching for Medium and smaller creatures) that creature is {@condition restrained} and it must make a DC 17 Strength saving throw. Creatures who fail take 55 ({@dice 10d10}) bludgeoning damage and creatures who succeed take half damage. Once the walls touch they grind against each other for two rounds.
