The drawing uses your finger to make marks as if it were a piece of charcoal, ink quill, or paintbrush (your choice). The marks you make can be in any color. Any drawing made by the ring can be easily smudged or washed away without leaving any marks behind. The ring can have up to a total of 5 square feet covered with drawings in this way at any time. Drawing more than that begins to erase the previous marks, and any mark left after 24 hours of being made is magically erased.",

										"Caius the Wizard has a keen interest in magic items. At the start, all he has is the {@skill Arcana} skill and big dreams. Let's walk through how turn those into a magic item.",
										"Caius the Wizard happens to be a level 4 wizard in this moment in time. Strangely, he's the only human in his party, and his lack of {@sense darkvision} has been holding them back.",
										"So, Caius decides to embark on making a set of {@item Goggles of Night|DMG}. Let's follow his journey:",
										"First, he'll need to gather that materials. He needs googles, a {@item scroll|KTKCG} of {@spell darkvision}, a {@item common primal essence|KTKCG}, and an {@item uncommon arcane essence|KTKCG}. Goggles are easily acquired from the local merchants for a few gold pieces, the rest will be a bit trickier.",
										"A {@item common primal essence|KTKCG} isn't that hard to come by, and can be found by harvesting elementals, dragons, giants, or monstrosities, even at the humble 0\u20134 CR rating of monsters Caius has been dealing with.",
										"The {@item uncommon arcane essence|KTKCG} will require a hunt. His party takes on a CR 5 undead, but on their {@dice d100}, they roll a 64... no luck, all that was left was some mangled bones and 3 {@item uncommon poisonous reagent|KTKCG|uncommon poisonous reagents}. After a few more tries, it seems luck isn't with them. Fortunately, Caius has a plan. That {@item uncommon poisonous reagent|KTKCG} he got can be combined with an {@item uncommon curative reagent|KTKCG} and {@item uncommon reactive reagent|KTKCG} in a simple 4 hour process with {@item Alchemist's supplies|PHB} and a head source ({@footnote page 181|This homebrew only has 147 pages...}).",
										"Boiling them all down, he's left with some magical residue forming an {@item uncommon arcane essence|KTKCG}. Now all he needs is the {@item scroll|KTKCG} of {@spell darkvision}. Caius really should have this spell long since given his {@sense darkvision} shortcomings, but never got around to it. So Caius shells out 90 gp to buy a scroll of it. Not to learn it though, of course, as soon he'll never need that spell again!",
										"All the pieces are assembled. As a level 4 Wizard with 16 Intelligence and proficiency in the {@skill Arcana} skill, Caius Enchanting Modifier is 2 (his {@skill Arcana} proficiency bonus) + 3 (his intelligence modifier), so is 5 total.",
										"During his next long rest, Caius makes his first crafting check, and rolls a {@dice d20}! It's a 10. 10 + 5 = 15, so he as a success. He's 1/4th of the way done, but needs to spend the rest of that long rest sleeping.",
										"The next day he rolls again, 6! That's only 11! One failure. The next night it's a 15 for a check of 20! That's a second success. Tragedy almost strikes with the next two checks being a 4 and 2, with results of 9 and 7 respectively, that's two more failures! All of his hard work is on the edge of being lost.",
										"But Caius asks to take an extra long break at the next town. He uses the 4 hours to make his next check, taking a 10 on the roll to forestall disaster. As he wasn't too ambitious and the {@item Goggles of Night|DMG} are only {@dc 13}, that means by {@variantrule taking 10|KTKCG}, Caius has a minimum check of a 15, and it's a pass. Feeling better, now that he's no longer one checked from the whole project failing, he makes his next check on the road, and gets an 18, for a total of 24. A fourth success, and he can take his watch that night with {@sense darkvision} at long last...",
										"...unfortunately he'd been up too late working and fell asleep, so his party got ambushed anyway, but that's a story for another time!",
										"Caius the Wizard now can see in the dark as well as any pointy eared elf or long bearded dwarf! It took a bit longer than he'd hoped, but now Caius has his very first shiny magic item made by his own hands!"
