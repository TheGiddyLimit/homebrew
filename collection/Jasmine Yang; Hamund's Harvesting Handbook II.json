By now I'm sure you've all cut your teeth on the monsters and creatures featured in {@loader Volume I|collection/Jasmine Yang; Hamund's Harvesting Handbook I.json} of this series and have come back hungry for more. Well you are in luck, because I have spent the interim hunting and harvesting all of the monsters featured in that seminal work; {@book Volo's Guide to Monsters|VGM} (written by another man who appreciates the value of good branding) and have prepared yet another catalogue of the natural riches to be found in the creatures around us.",
								"But wait, there's more! I have brought back secret spells from forgotten lands, filled a list of new items to craft, and even compiled a compendium of the needy people I met on my travels in the hopes that my readers may lend them a helping hand. The book you hold is more than just an instruction manual, it is a veritable travel guide to adventure!",
								"So, indulge yourselves dear readers in the knowledge that I have gained and now pass onto you. Discover how to skin a sea spawn, gut a grung, and debone a devourer (which is quite a difficult feat considering they are almost nothing but bones). Learn how to craft powerful weapons from the spoils of your hunts, as well as wield new magic to aid you in your work. The sky is the limit in our profession, and even the old dogs among you could still stand to learn a few new tricks.",

This volume covers the monsters included in {@book Volo's Guide to Monsters|VGM}, and as before, features a complete harvesting list for each monster, as well as over 80 new magical items to craft. The rules for harvesting and crafting are unchanged, but this book does add a few more interesting pieces to add to your harvesting adventures. Premiering in this book are new NPC merchants for you to pull out on the fly, 6 new spells designed to help harvesters, as well as a job board for every monster in the {@book Monster Manual|MM} and {@book Volo's|VGM} to help DMs make harvesting-based quests on the fly. Everything has been written with balance in mind, but you are of course feel free to rebalance anything in this guide to suit your own table, or feel free to message me at {@link driftersgameworkshop@gmail.com|mailto:driftersgameworkshop@gmail.com} or hit me up on Twitter {@link @drifterworkshop|https://twitter.com/drifterworkshop} to discuss anything in this guide."

These prices are intended as a baseline only, and the DM is free to adjust these values as they see fit for their campaign. The DM is also to keep in mind that, although certain items may have high values, not all vendors may want to buy them. For example, although Devourer Skin may be worth the high price of 2,250 gp, it may be difficult to sell it to the village grocer. Sometimes, finding the right buyer for an esoteric item can be an entertaining side quest in and of itself, or simply used as a good downtime activity."

In my studies of them however, I have found that a giant's physiology is extremely malleable, allowing them to either alter themselves or be altered by environmental factors much more than the average humanoid. Perhaps this is an added feature of the Ordning, allowing individual giants greater ability to delineate themselves within their caste, or even break free from it altogether.

Upon their death, a reaction takes place immediately in the bodily fluids of a hag that makes them a vector for transmitting \"{@disease Crone's Disease|HHHVI}.\" Whenever a creature imbibes any bodily fluids from a deceased hag, they must succeed on a {@dc 15} Constitution saving throw or become infected with {@disease crone's disease|HHHVI}. A character whose harvesting check fails to harvest anything from the hag also runs the risk of contracting {@disease crone's disease|HHHVI} as they clumsily splash blood in an orifice or in an open wound.",
										"Upon contracting {@disease crone's disease|HHHVI}, 1 of the victim's facial features/body parts immediately transforms to look more hag like. For example, their nose may become hooked, or their hands become claw-like. Every 24 hours, the victim may attempt the saving throw again. On a success, the disease ends, and every 24 hours subsequently, 1 transformed feature returns to normal. On a failure, another facial feature or body part changes to become more hag-like, and the disease continues. Every 7 days, any currently transformed feature becomes permanent even after the disease is cured. At that point, only restorative magic such as that of the spell {@spell greater restoration} may return the creature to their normal appearance.",

Most of my samples of illithid experiments come from humanoids like grimlocks and duergar, so you can imagine how interesting it is to see illithid influence on the simple brain of a beast. The way their feral instincts interacts with psionic control is fascinating, and I simply cannot have enough samples. If you can bring them back in one piece, I will gladly pay you for each brain you can find."

The problem is that some of our warriors can engage in a fight with a slaad and not realise they've been infected until it is far too late. To remedy this, I want to invent a vaccine against these infections, and to do this, I need to study slaad biology a little more closely. Slaad slime would be a good start since they use it to protect their bodies; perhaps some reverse engineering can make a potion that causes the imbiber to produce antigens that kill eggs as soon as they're implanted."

It is a tradition in my family to venture out into the world and destroy orcs wherever we find them, taking their hearts back in triumph to our ancestral home. I, however, have not done so well in this regard. While I have cut through quite a few orcs, I have yet to find any special ones; those touched by the orcish pantheon. If I could bring a few of those home, even if they were not from my kills, I would be able to return with no small amount of glory."

To remedy this, I want to invent a vaccine against these infections, and to do this, I need to study slaad biology a little more closely. Slaad slime would be a good start since they use it to protect their bodies; perhaps some reverse engineering can make a potion that causes the imbiber to produce antigens that kill eggs as soon as they're implanted."

Most of my samples of illithid experiments come from humanoids like grimlocks and duergar, so you can imagine how interesting it is to see illithid influence on the simple brain of a beast. The way their feral instincts interacts with psionic control is fascinating, and I simply cannot have enough samples. If you can bring them back in one piece, I will gladly pay you for each brain you can find."

The problem is that some of our warriors can engage in a fight with a slaad and not realise they've been infected until it is far too late. To remedy this, I want to invent a vaccine against these infections, and to do this, I need to study slaad biology a little more closely. Slaad slime would be a good start since they use it to protect their bodies; perhaps some reverse engineering can make a potion that causes the imbiber to produce antigens that kill eggs as soon as they're implanted."

To remedy this, I want to invent a vaccine against these infections, and to do this, I need to study slaad biology a little more closely. Slaad slime would be a good start since they use it to protect their bodies; perhaps some reverse engineering can make a potion that causes the imbiber to produce antigens that kill eggs as soon as they're implanted."

There's not really much I can do to save them from their terrible fates, but what I can do is make sure they get a little justice for themselves before they face them. I want to keep a little shoosuva fur on me when I go watch the fights, a whiff of that will turn even the most timid animals into a rabid monster that'll tear the throat out of the next jerk that steps into the ring with them (and if I happen to make a little money betting on the underdog, then where's the harm in that?)"

I've heard that some crafty tinkers out there have figured out how to transform the tongue of a froghemoth into a weapon chain that can make your weapon an extension of your own hand. I would get it myself of course, but I'm too busy right now with more important quests."

I have made it my goal to end them once and for all, and to do that, I will need access to Gehenna. If you can get me yugoloth hearts, I can craft them into gems that will take my companions and I into that dark realm, to confront the legendary yugoloth general and destroy him."
