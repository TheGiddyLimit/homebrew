To be fair, all of the mind flayers had an interest in space. But his was different. Where the others thought as one with the Elder Brain and planned the expansion and well-being of the colony, he preferred to be consumed by his star-gazing thoughts alone. And when others viewed the stars as destinations\u2014homes for worlds to conquer\u2014he saw them as travelers, unerringly making their way through the heavens, ever so slowly. He imagined how populated some could be, and how sparse and dead others were. And yet they all looked the same from so afar. So small.",
					"He couldn't look away when he learned that some of the stars he was gazing at were already dead. Behind the veil of the slow-travelling light now he knew secretly stood a void. And who knew how many more of the stars where the same. How much of the universe was secretly quiet? A quiet and peaceful void, everlasting and yet everchanging. The remnants of the star traveling alone for some reason brought him peace. His eyes failed to see it just as the eyes of the others did. There was light after all. Everything was fine. But in his mind he could see it. And he found it intoxicating\u2014the power behind all of reality\u2014hiding from everyone.",
					"He imagined the quiet again. He could exist in it without bothering it, and without it bothering him. It he could be one with it, that peaceful quiet would make him feel whole. It would be his natural state. And he would finally find something with which he could think as one.",
					"The other mind flayers severed him from his tentacles for meddling with null elementalism\u2014the worst form of arcanism\u2014and exiled him away and alone. But that did not matter."

You reduce the damage you take from the triggering effect to 0, by shunting the harmful energy to a parallel void realm. If the spell ends before its full duration elapses, the energy returns, striking you as it would normally have, and you take as much damage as you would have taken from this spell's triggering effect. If you concentrate on this spell for its full duration, the energy is siphoned off into nothing."

For example, if you try to erase from existence a cruel warlord in order to prevent his crimes, a crueler one might take his place. Additionally, the DM could rule that this act creates an alternate timeline, and only creatures in that other timeline live in the universe where that creature did not exist."
