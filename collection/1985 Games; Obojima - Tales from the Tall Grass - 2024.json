What is known about the dara is that they are insatiably curious, a gift they claim is from their progenitor. Dara often gravitate toward being wanderers, seeking out anything that interests them, and many scrawl notes and sketches as they are observing. It's hard to know what a dara will be fascinated by next, as they are just as interested in a small bug trundling over a leaf as they are a sinuous dragon flying through the sky.",

Ventu, heartbroken at the thought of what might become of the sheep dragon just beyond the hillside, made the heroic choice to stand against the inferno on their own.",
