Dara often gravitate toward being wanderers, seeking out anything that interests them, and many scrawl notes and sketches as they are observing.

But she brought with her a hammer, for she had no intention of being eaten. A battle ensued. Aided by many spirits, Ineh smashed the fangs from Yutro's maw, scattering them to the far corners of the island. Fangless, Yutro surrendered to Ineh and retreated into the mountain. To this day, however, Yutro's fangs can be found in random places on Obojima, often embedded in the earth, in trees, or even in stone."

The story most often repeated regarding dragon root claims that wherever it is found, it marks the footfalls of a spirit dragon from a bygone age named Runivarish. Whether or not this is true, or not, locals do find it peculiar that dragon root, once harvested, will grow in the exact same spot, as if marking something. Dragon root burns hotter than most woods and coals and is therefore valuable to both brewers and smiths."

Although the outside of a scalefruit is rather unappetizing, the interior is sweet and delicious, and is easily scooped after the fruit is cut in half. Many scalefruit farmers can be easily identified as they always carry a sharp cleaver and a metal scoop. Scalefruit trees are found along the coastline as they love sandy soil. Many seaside villages have their own creative versions of scalefruit drinks that they proudly serve to travelers."

But hammer gulls are not the brightest of birds and have been known to simply drop boulders on all manner of things including houses, boats, and beachgoers. Thus, hammer gulls are considered dangerous pests by Obojimans and are chased away if they get too close for comfort. There are some who have found ways to domesticate hammer gulls and use them as mounts by hatching one of their eggs and raising them by hand. These “gull-tamers” are known throughout Obojima as being a cast of odd characters, cut from a different cloth, and usually as loony as the gulls themselves.",
