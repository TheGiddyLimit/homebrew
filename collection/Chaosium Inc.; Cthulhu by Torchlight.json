The Mythos are the invention of HP Lovecraft, a pulp writer whose stories of strange, cosmic horror inspired imaginations across the world. Lovecraft's signature creations, the dread {@i Necronomicon} and the horrid Cthulhu, have been cornerstones of horror, fantasy, and gaming for decades.",

								"The Cthulhu Mythos is based on the concept that on a cosmic level human concerns-economics, laws, religion, and morality-are irrelevant. The true nature of the universe is alien, horrifying, and ultimately uncaring. Humanity is an irrelevant byproduct of the cosmos, a random accident that has no ability to influence the course of events.",
								"Instead, the universe is ruled by entities with power far beyond human comprehension. These entities have cares, needs, and desires that are incomprehensible or nonsensical to humanity. Despite their fundamentally alien nature, humans can learn enough about their nature to call upon their power and wield it to their petty, ultimately meaningless ends. Folk who worship Mythos entities create cults dedicated to them, but such acts are empty pantomimes. Mythos entities have no need for worshippers. The \"gifts\" they offer are byproducts of their nature that happen to be useful to humans.",
								"Those who worship the Mythos inevitably lose part of their humanity as they begin to see cultural and ethical concerns as meaningless diversions from the pursuit of power. The Mythos are ultimately impossible to understand, but the terrible power they grant is very real. Wielding the Mythos slowly, but inevitably, causes a mortal to lose their grip on their ethics, morality, and ultimately their humanity. Given a glimpse into the broader cosmic order where humanity is irrelevant, cults and their leaders set aside all concerns beyond the accumulation of more Mythos secrets and the power they offer.",
								"This is the point where the player characters step into the story. In a TTRPG that features the Cthulhu Mythos, the characters are bold investigators who stumble across a cult's plot. Armed with their wits, insight, and cunning (and in the case of a fantasy RPG, a trusty sword or arcane magic), the heroes thwart a cult's ambitions and keep the world safe. The universe might be fundamentally hostile, and humanity irrelevant, but the world is a good place worth protecting. Fighting against the Mythos and its followers is the ultimate expression of hope and humanity. The dark approaches, but falls short while the heroes are on watch."
