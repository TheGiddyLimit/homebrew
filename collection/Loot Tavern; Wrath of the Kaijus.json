Compensation represents an exchange of goods  or services, as is typical of mercenaries, couriers, or assassins.

An ancient crown or a kaiju's bone would allow a historiomancer to observe the scene through the eyes of the item or the creature from which the item came.

								"As with all waterways in the Yokai Realms, the Hakuryū river, the pulsing heart of the Hakuryū Valley, is embodied by a yokai spirit: Bakuryō. Those of a more poetic persuasion describe the river's many tributaries as Bakuryō's arms, fingers, and claws; its central, sinuous lake her belly; and the raging gorge her tooth-filled maw. Whether Bakuryō is the soul of the river, its physical avatar, or just another river-dwelling yokai is a source of eternal debate. Regardless, most locals agree that Bakuryō is a gentle and noble patron of the valley\u2014most of the time, anyway.",
								"For nigh on a millennium, Bakuryō has regulated the river's flow, inciting rains in times of drought, gouging the earth to hasten the flow during floods, and shepherding the small Beasts that create the upland wetlands responsible for the river's regular and reliable current. When Bakuryō discovered that her shrines had been liberated of all their gold, she sought to find the wrongdoer. Torime, an especially avaricious dodomeki, had heard of the valley's wealth and travelled there to eat its riches. Gorging herself on the koi dragon's gold, Torime grew fat and slow, and Bakuryō was able to follow the yokai's deep footprints to a small cave where the greedy monster was dozing in a gold-induced torpor.",
								"Bakuryō snapped shut her fanged maw, waking the fiendish yokai, who ran deeper into the cave in terror. Bakuryō pursued, but was unable to navigate the twisting labyrinth and soon wedged herself between damp stone walls. With a wrench, Bakuryō pulled herself free and, in the process, flipped a chevron-shaped scale under her chin. She changed entirely, her personality, ego and id alike, becoming its exact mirror. Nobility became malice, gentleness became fury, and down became up as the Hakuryū river changed direction.",
								"Flooding. Chaos. Disaster. The paddies were drowned under muddy waters, the flow of goods downriver was halted, and the valley was split into a patchwork of disjointed islands isolated by roiling, turbulent water. Now, the locals have fled their flooded homes and cling to ancient caves hewn from the steep-sided mountains.",
								"But this is not the first time. Whether it be playing in a beaverfrog's dam, surfing down a mountainside's first snow, or searching for rare mushrooms in a damp cave, Bakuryō has flipped a scale more than once in the past. Although such events quickly fade to myth and legend, the shrines' murals recount these events and contain a hidden secret.",
								"The floor of each shrine contains a mosaic. Within that mosaic, a single, chevron-shaped scale is designed to flip upwards when the waters rise high enough. Pushing that scale back down casts the {@spell calm waters spell|WrathOfTheKaiju}, allowing the river to be forded. Moreover, the act of replacing the scale is a reminder of how to solve this disaster: flip Bakuryō's scale. The only trouble is finding her.",

However, the reality is quite different: they are shadowy puppet masters whose influence runs deep throughout the institutions of the Realms. With the pull of a string or a nudge off a cliff, laws are passed, wars are declared, and machinations are set in motion. The internal landscape is one of plots within plots, with power shifting as easily as sand.

Through gifts, flattery, and cunning competence, they secured their role as teachers of the emperors' heirs and began a careful campaign to become the emperors' only advisors. Once this was achieved, they distracted the rulers with hedonism and luxury, passing favourable laws in the emperors' name. Eventually, the Realms fell into rebellion and, sensing the turning of the tide, the Silk Purse overthrew the final emperor, Tokihito, in the name of the people. Since then, they have been remembered as saviours, rather than the conniving tyrants they were.",

Then, when the wayhouses are no longer manned and the patrols don't keep watch, they pay outlaws to raid trade caravans and villages, and even commit arson. A subsequent war of misinformation turns public opinion against the rebels, including members of the Heirs of Kirin who come to aid destitute villagers, and the Purse is welcomed back with open arms."

An ancient crown or a kaiju's bone would allow a historiomancer to observe the scene through the eyes of the item or the creature from which the item came.

Those of a more poetic persuasion describe the river's many tributaries as Bakuryō's arms, fingers, and claws; its central, sinuous lake her belly; and the raging gorge her tooth-filled maw. Whether Bakuryō is the soul of the river, its physical avatar, or just another river-dwelling yokai is a source of eternal debate. Regardless, most locals agree that Bakuryō is a gentle and noble patron of the valley\u2014most of the time, anyway.",
								"For nigh on a millennium, Bakuryō has regulated the river's flow, inciting rains in times of drought, gouging the earth to hasten the flow during floods, and shepherding the small Beasts that create the upland wetlands responsible for the river's regular and reliable current. When Bakuryō discovered that her shrines had been liberated of all their gold, she sought to find the wrongdoer. Torime, an especially avaricious dodomeki, had heard of the valley's wealth and travelled there to eat its riches. Gorging herself on the koi dragon's gold, Torime grew fat and slow, and Bakuryō was able to follow the yokai's deep footprints to a small cave where the greedy monster was dozing in a gold-induced torpor.",
								"Bakuryō snapped shut her fanged maw, waking the fiendish yokai, who ran deeper into the cave in terror. Bakuryō pursued, but was unable to navigate the twisting labyrinth and soon wedged herself between damp stone walls. With a wrench, Bakuryō pulled herself free and, in the process, flipped a chevron-shaped scale under her chin. She changed entirely, her personality, ego and id alike, becoming its exact mirror. Nobility became malice, gentleness became fury, and down became up as the Hakuryū river changed direction.",
								"Flooding. Chaos. Disaster. The paddies were drowned under muddy waters, the flow of goods downriver was halted, and the valley was split into a patchwork of disjointed islands isolated by roiling, turbulent water. Now, the locals have fled their flooded homes and cling to ancient caves hewn from the steep-sided mountains.",
								"But this is not the first time. Whether it be playing in a beaverfrog's dam, surfing down a mountainside's first snow, or searching for rare mushrooms in a damp cave, Bakuryō has flipped a scale more than once in the past. Although such events quickly fade to myth and legend, the shrines' murals recount these events and contain a hidden secret.",
								"The floor of each shrine contains a mosaic. Within that mosaic, a single, chevron-shaped scale is designed to flip upwards when the waters rise high enough. Pushing that scale back down casts the {@spell calm waters spell|WrathOfTheKaiju}, allowing the river to be forded. Moreover, the act of replacing the scale is a reminder of how to solve this disaster: flip Bakuryō's scale. The only trouble is finding her.",

								"From court scribes to adventurous archaeologists, The Chroniclers provide a service to all people of the Realms: objective record-keeping. All chroniclers take an oath of honesty and secrecy. They cannot tell a lie and, if asked, will keep secret anything they observe for a period of fifty years, recording the information on sheets of psychic paper that only the writer can read. To eject a chronicler from one's presence is at best an admission of a lack of transparency, and at worst a confession of one's will to commit deception.",
								"For the past few hundred years, The Chroniclers have recorded history without the bias found in the records that predate their existence. To aid in this objective record-keeping, mages within the order have developed historiomancy, a branch of divination magic that allows wielders to look into the past. This magic requires a focus, typically an item that was present during the events that are being investigated. An ancient crown or a kaiju's bone would allow a historiomancer to observe the scene through the eyes of the item or the creature from which the item came. This power is limited, though; the further back in time you look, the more skill is required to bring the pertinent information into focus from among the chaff of white noise.",

Historiomancy's delving into the past has earnt them friends and enemies; secrets buried for years have been unearthed, leading to innocent prisoners being released and guilty nobles being brought to justice."

								"As with all waterways in the Yokai Realms, the Hakuryū river, the pulsing heart of the Hakuryū Valley, is embodied by a yokai spirit: Bakuryō. Those of a more poetic persuasion describe the river's many tributaries as Bakuryō's arms, fingers, and claws; its central, sinuous lake her belly; and the raging gorge her tooth-filled maw. Whether Bakuryō is the soul of the river, its physical avatar, or just another river-dwelling yokai is a source of eternal debate. Regardless, most locals agree that Bakuryō is a gentle and noble patron of the valley\u2014most of the time, anyway.",
								"For nigh on a millennium, Bakuryō has regulated the river's flow, inciting rains in times of drought, gouging the earth to hasten the flow during floods, and shepherding the small Beasts that create the upland wetlands responsible for the river's regular and reliable current. When Bakuryō discovered that her shrines had been liberated of all their gold, she sought to find the wrongdoer. Torime, an especially avaricious dodomeki, had heard of the valley's wealth and travelled there to eat its riches. Gorging herself on the koi dragon's gold, Torime grew fat and slow, and Bakuryō was able to follow the yokai's deep footprints to a small cave where the greedy monster was dozing in a gold-induced torpor.",
								"Bakuryō snapped shut her fanged maw, waking the fiendish yokai, who ran deeper into the cave in terror. Bakuryō pursued, but was unable to navigate the twisting labyrinth and soon wedged herself between damp stone walls. With a wrench, Bakuryō pulled herself free and, in the process, flipped a chevron-shaped scale under her chin. She changed entirely, her personality, ego and id alike, becoming its exact mirror. Nobility became malice, gentleness became fury, and down became up as the Hakuryū river changed direction.",
								"Flooding. Chaos. Disaster. The paddies were drowned under muddy waters, the flow of goods downriver was halted, and the valley was split into a patchwork of disjointed islands isolated by roiling, turbulent water. Now, the locals have fled their flooded homes and cling to ancient caves hewn from the steep-sided mountains.",
								"But this is not the first time. Whether it be playing in a beaverfrog's dam, surfing down a mountainside's first snow, or searching for rare mushrooms in a damp cave, Bakuryō has flipped a scale more than once in the past. Although such events quickly fade to myth and legend, the shrines' murals recount these events and contain a hidden secret.",
								"The floor of each shrine contains a mosaic. Within that mosaic, a single, chevron-shaped scale is designed to flip upwards when the waters rise high enough. Pushing that scale back down casts the {@spell calm waters spell|WrathOfTheKaiju}, allowing the river to be forded. Moreover, the act of replacing the scale is a reminder of how to solve this disaster: flip Bakuryō's scale. The only trouble is finding her.",

The internal landscape is one of plots within plots, with power shifting as easily as sand.

Once this was achieved, they distracted the rulers with hedonism and luxury, passing favourable laws in the emperors' name. Eventually, the Realms fell into rebellion and, sensing the turning of the tide, the Silk Purse overthrew the final emperor, Tokihito, in the name of the people. Since then, they have been remembered as saviours, rather than the conniving tyrants they were.",

Then, when the wayhouses are no longer manned and the patrols don't keep watch, they pay outlaws to raid trade caravans and villages, and even commit arson. A subsequent war of misinformation turns public opinion against the rebels, including members of the Heirs of Kirin who come to aid destitute villagers, and the Purse is welcomed back with open arms."

An ancient crown or a kaiju's bone would allow a historiomancer to observe the scene through the eyes of the item or the creature from which the item came.

								"When the fisherfolk of Yūsha Village heard the bitan's song, it was a cause for celebration and a symbol of the ocean's respect for the villagers. The fisherfolk killed and landed the whale-like yokai in the proper fashion (see Flora, Fauna, & Things, page 121) and were astonished by the ancient beast's size; its meat would feed the village for months. The honour was immense, and the villagers knew to return its horns and bones to the sea by the next full moon to ensure the creature's soul could pass on.",
								"Unbeknownst to the villagers, the bitan had chosen Akibatsu Cove as its final resting place, a fog-shrouded reef home to the Mistraider Privateers. Seeing the bounty of the Yūshan's harvest, the pirates jumped into a sloop, manoeuvred out to the villagers, and stole their boat and catch.",
								"Except for Diloophi, an orphaned enkoh child with dreams of being a pirate, all of the fisherfolk were squeezed onto an overcrowded lifeboat and sent home empty-handed.",
								"The pirates, lazy brigands to the core, harvested only the most valuable parts of the bitan and let much of the rest rot. From the tailbone of the creature, a dwarven mage named Patchwork Wakō\u2014or Captain Patches to the Mistraiders\u2014 forged a trident capable of controlling the crepuscular mists peculiar to this coastline. Though the pirates had always used the mists to hide their raids, Captain Patches' newfound magic raised them from an occasional threat into an ever-present menace.",
								"Three weeks later, Iminada, the lord of sea beasts, made her monthly journey to the Material Plane from the immeasurable fathoms of the Sea of Songs, singing a song heard only by the souls of great marine monsters. Many dead beasts gathered to her pod, an ethereal wave of shimmering green visible only to the melancholy, but one was missing. A great and ancient bitan, the same beast that had given itself to the Yūshans, could not join Iminada; its soul was still bound to the bones of Captain Patches' trident.",
								"After a month had passed and Iminada's ghostly conference had still not found the lost bitan, the sea lord's form began to reconstitute itself on the Material Plane, the great whale's skeleton coalescing within its ethereal outline. Once manifested, she began a necrotic ritual such that the beached bitan's bones might be freed of their decaying flesh. Firstly, her mournful presence turned creatures within a mile of her that were not immersed in sea water into Undead. And secondly, she sang a song of desolation that created an unquenchable rot in all undead flesh within twenty miles. Unfortunately for creatures that floated above the water or lived close to the coast, this caused them to become collateral victims of Iminada's unwavering quest.",
								"The first to sicken were the pirates, those closest to the hub of Iminada's search. The young enkoh who had joined them was in the sea cleaning barnacles off of the hull when the whale first sang its song, a fortunate occurrence that spared the child from a grisly decomposition. Finding all the pirates dead, Diloophi took the Yūshan whaling ship and managed to navigate home, whereupon he found his village in disarray. The same sickness, though seemingly slower-acting and less severe, had taken root in Yūsha Village.",
								"A travelling cleric of the Heirs of Kirin, Kalla Chiyū, was attempting to cure the illness with no success. Healing magic simply caused rancid growth of the rotten flesh. Spells that removed curses only suspended the effects. Though the link with the song, which occurs at each high tide, has been discovered, no amount of soundproofing of the infirmary has had any effect. No one in the region knows the source of this plague, and Kalla has begged the Heirs for help.",

Feeding starving villagers, saving stranded monks, and otherwise helping those in need falls into this category. Curiosity is a desire to know more about the world. The motivation behind this can vary: a wizard may want to find new branches of magic, an orphan may wish to discover the secrets behind their parents' demise, and a visitor to the Realms may simply wish to learn of its history. Compensation represents an exchange of goods  or services, as is typical of mercenaries, couriers, or assassins. Each hook, regardless of category, can come with a monetary reward, but compensation hooks typically use the reward as the main motivation."

								"When the fisherfolk of Yūsha Village heard the bitan's song, it was a cause for celebration and a symbol of the ocean's respect for the villagers. The fisherfolk killed and landed the whale-like yokai in the proper fashion (see Flora, Fauna, & Things, page 121) and were astonished by the ancient beast's size; its meat would feed the village for months. The honour was immense, and the villagers knew to return its horns and bones to the sea by the next full moon to ensure the creature's soul could pass on.",
								"Unbeknownst to the villagers, the bitan had chosen Akibatsu Cove as its final resting place, a fog-shrouded reef home to the Mistraider Privateers. Seeing the bounty of the Yūshan's harvest, the pirates jumped into a sloop, manoeuvred out to the villagers, and stole their boat and catch.",
								"Except for Diloophi, an orphaned enkoh child with dreams of being a pirate, all of the fisherfolk were squeezed onto an overcrowded lifeboat and sent home empty-handed.",
								"The pirates, lazy brigands to the core, harvested only the most valuable parts of the bitan and let much of the rest rot. From the tailbone of the creature, a dwarven mage named Patchwork Wakō\u2014or Captain Patches to the Mistraiders\u2014 forged a trident capable of controlling the crepuscular mists peculiar to this coastline. Though the pirates had always used the mists to hide their raids, Captain Patches' newfound magic raised them from an occasional threat into an ever-present menace.",
								"Three weeks later, Iminada, the lord of sea beasts, made her monthly journey to the Material Plane from the immeasurable fathoms of the Sea of Songs, singing a song heard only by the souls of great marine monsters. Many dead beasts gathered to her pod, an ethereal wave of shimmering green visible only to the melancholy, but one was missing. A great and ancient bitan, the same beast that had given itself to the Yūshans, could not join Iminada; its soul was still bound to the bones of Captain Patches' trident.",
								"After a month had passed and Iminada's ghostly conference had still not found the lost bitan, the sea lord's form began to reconstitute itself on the Material Plane, the great whale's skeleton coalescing within its ethereal outline. Once manifested, she began a necrotic ritual such that the beached bitan's bones might be freed of their decaying flesh. Firstly, her mournful presence turned creatures within a mile of her that were not immersed in sea water into Undead. And secondly, she sang a song of desolation that created an unquenchable rot in all undead flesh within twenty miles. Unfortunately for creatures that floated above the water or lived close to the coast, this caused them to become collateral victims of Iminada's unwavering quest.",
								"The first to sicken were the pirates, those closest to the hub of Iminada's search. The young enkoh who had joined them was in the sea cleaning barnacles off of the hull when the whale first sang its song, a fortunate occurrence that spared the child from a grisly decomposition. Finding all the pirates dead, Diloophi took the Yūshan whaling ship and managed to navigate home, whereupon he found his village in disarray. The same sickness, though seemingly slower-acting and less severe, had taken root in Yūsha Village.",
								"A travelling cleric of the Heirs of Kirin, Kalla Chiyū, was attempting to cure the illness with no success. Healing magic simply caused rancid growth of the rotten flesh. Spells that removed curses only suspended the effects. Though the link with the song, which occurs at each high tide, has been discovered, no amount of soundproofing of the infirmary has had any effect. No one in the region knows the source of this plague, and Kalla has begged the Heirs for help.",

								"From court scribes to adventurous archaeologists, The Chroniclers provide a service to all people of the Realms: objective record-keeping. All chroniclers take an oath of honesty and secrecy. They cannot tell a lie and, if asked, will keep secret anything they observe for a period of fifty years, recording the information on sheets of psychic paper that only the writer can read. To eject a chronicler from one's presence is at best an admission of a lack of transparency, and at worst a confession of one's will to commit deception.",
								"For the past few hundred years, The Chroniclers have recorded history without the bias found in the records that predate their existence. To aid in this objective record-keeping, mages within the order have developed historiomancy, a branch of divination magic that allows wielders to look into the past. This magic requires a focus, typically an item that was present during the events that are being investigated. An ancient crown or a kaiju's bone would allow a historiomancer to observe the scene through the eyes of the item or the creature from which the item came. This power is limited, though; the further back in time you look, the more skill is required to bring the pertinent information into focus from among the chaff of white noise.",

Historiomancy's delving into the past has earnt them friends and enemies; secrets buried for years have been unearthed, leading to innocent prisoners being released and guilty nobles being brought to justice."

								"When the fisherfolk of Yūsha Village heard the bitan's song, it was a cause for celebration and a symbol of the ocean's respect for the villagers. The fisherfolk killed and landed the whale-like yokai in the proper fashion (see Flora, Fauna, & Things, page 121) and were astonished by the ancient beast's size; its meat would feed the village for months. The honour was immense, and the villagers knew to return its horns and bones to the sea by the next full moon to ensure the creature's soul could pass on.",
								"Unbeknownst to the villagers, the bitan had chosen Akibatsu Cove as its final resting place, a fog-shrouded reef home to the Mistraider Privateers. Seeing the bounty of the Yūshan's harvest, the pirates jumped into a sloop, manoeuvred out to the villagers, and stole their boat and catch.",
								"Except for Diloophi, an orphaned enkoh child with dreams of being a pirate, all of the fisherfolk were squeezed onto an overcrowded lifeboat and sent home empty-handed.",
								"The pirates, lazy brigands to the core, harvested only the most valuable parts of the bitan and let much of the rest rot. From the tailbone of the creature, a dwarven mage named Patchwork Wakō\u2014or Captain Patches to the Mistraiders\u2014 forged a trident capable of controlling the crepuscular mists peculiar to this coastline. Though the pirates had always used the mists to hide their raids, Captain Patches' newfound magic raised them from an occasional threat into an ever-present menace.",
								"Three weeks later, Iminada, the lord of sea beasts, made her monthly journey to the Material Plane from the immeasurable fathoms of the Sea of Songs, singing a song heard only by the souls of great marine monsters. Many dead beasts gathered to her pod, an ethereal wave of shimmering green visible only to the melancholy, but one was missing. A great and ancient bitan, the same beast that had given itself to the Yūshans, could not join Iminada; its soul was still bound to the bones of Captain Patches' trident.",
								"After a month had passed and Iminada's ghostly conference had still not found the lost bitan, the sea lord's form began to reconstitute itself on the Material Plane, the great whale's skeleton coalescing within its ethereal outline. Once manifested, she began a necrotic ritual such that the beached bitan's bones might be freed of their decaying flesh. Firstly, her mournful presence turned creatures within a mile of her that were not immersed in sea water into Undead. And secondly, she sang a song of desolation that created an unquenchable rot in all undead flesh within twenty miles. Unfortunately for creatures that floated above the water or lived close to the coast, this caused them to become collateral victims of Iminada's unwavering quest.",
								"The first to sicken were the pirates, those closest to the hub of Iminada's search. The young enkoh who had joined them was in the sea cleaning barnacles off of the hull when the whale first sang its song, a fortunate occurrence that spared the child from a grisly decomposition. Finding all the pirates dead, Diloophi took the Yūshan whaling ship and managed to navigate home, whereupon he found his village in disarray. The same sickness, though seemingly slower-acting and less severe, had taken root in Yūsha Village.",
								"A travelling cleric of the Heirs of Kirin, Kalla Chiyū, was attempting to cure the illness with no success. Healing magic simply caused rancid growth of the rotten flesh. Spells that removed curses only suspended the effects. Though the link with the song, which occurs at each high tide, has been discovered, no amount of soundproofing of the infirmary has had any effect. No one in the region knows the source of this plague, and Kalla has begged the Heirs for help.",

An ancient crown or a kaiju's bone would allow a historiomancer to observe the scene through the eyes of the item or the creature from which the item came.

								"In the time when the Yokai Realms had emperors, the Silk Purse was not the powerhouse that it is today. Like all guilds, it began life as a collection of like-minded folks\u2014merchants seeking to establish norms for their trade and speak with a singular voice. But shrewd minds among their number devised a plan. With gifts of treasure and information, they gained access to the emperor's inner circle and, from this trusted position, offered to teach the emperor's offspring the ways of trade and finance. Instead of an education, these cunning advisors spoiled the emperor's children, instilling in them a love of hedonism rather than a respect for their rule.",
								"When each emperor passed, the guildsmen offered to deal with the boring matters of state so that the newly-crowned emperor could enjoy all the pleasures available to them. The Silk Purse's High Council became the shadow rulers of the empire, while the emperor was merely a puppet. They passed greedy laws in the emperors' name, leaving the rulers none the wiser to the suffering their subjects endured, and three consecutive monarchs became known as the Egregious Emperors for the outrageousness of their rule. Sensing the unease, the Silk Purse fomented a rebellion, overthrowing the emperors in the name of the people and birthing the city-states and factions seen today. Seen as the common folks' saviour, the Silk Purse has since cemented itself as the financial lifeblood of the Realms.",
								"None of this is known, of course, for history is written by the victor. In the Pondermoss Weald, a vast forest filled with kodama and the tombs of great people, the Egregious Emperors were paid a final insult. Within the House of the Forgotten, a monastery in a distant corner of the weald dedicated to unremembered souls, the three corpses were unceremoniously inhumed. With their souls settled in a final resting place, the emperors learnt of the true happenings during their reign. They persisted as ghosts, intent on revealing the machinations of which they were previously unaware. For centuries, they wallowed in their self-pity, until, at last, an unsuspecting visitor arrived.",
								"Shan Reede, researcher for The Chroniclers and ex-professional bard, was intrigued by the deceased rulers, individuals so narcissistic they had been buried in the furthest, highest reaches of the weald. She found their triptych of tombs nestled in the roots of an enormous goldenheart zelkova tree in the monastery's courtyard (see Flora, Fauna, & Things on page 90, and Ubusuna, page 247). Using historiomancy, a branch of divination magic, she discovered many truths about the emperors' existence and, at the end of each day's research, she penned their tale into a song.",
								"As the emperors' spirits listened to Shan Reede's song, they were appalled by the perceived inaccuracies of her lyrics\u2014they were heavily biased towards their own innocence\u2014 and appeared to her with notes and corrections. Over the following month, Shan developed the song, her bawdy ditty turning into a lengthy saga, and sent missives back to The Chroniclers describing 'revelatory discoveries about the Silk Purse's origin'. Unfortunately for her, the missives' details found their way to unfriendly ears, and the Silk Purse dispatched an assassin to ensure she died in an unavoidable accident.",
								"Shan Reede often returned to the Verdant Gorge to send messages to her superiors, collect supplies, and partake of some rest and relaxation before travelling back to the waiting emperors. When Shan did not return to the monastery, the emperors grew anxious that their tale would not be heard. Their desperate anger influenced the psychically porous kodama that infused the goldenheart zelkova. The enormous tree's roots writhed and pushed, wrenching free a quarter-mile chunk of rock, trees, and earth: an ubusuna kaiju! Now the kaiju, known to the locals as the Wandering Earth, roams the weald in search of the lost chronicler, leaving a trail of destruction in its wake. Moreover, where it roams, kodama become fearful and defensive, animating plants that lash out at the people who once acted as the forest's caretakers.",

An ancient crown or a kaiju's bone would allow a historiomancer to observe the scene through the eyes of the item or the creature from which the item came.

								"In the time when the Yokai Realms had emperors, the Silk Purse was not the powerhouse that it is today. Like all guilds, it began life as a collection of like-minded folks\u2014merchants seeking to establish norms for their trade and speak with a singular voice. But shrewd minds among their number devised a plan. With gifts of treasure and information, they gained access to the emperor's inner circle and, from this trusted position, offered to teach the emperor's offspring the ways of trade and finance. Instead of an education, these cunning advisors spoiled the emperor's children, instilling in them a love of hedonism rather than a respect for their rule.",
								"When each emperor passed, the guildsmen offered to deal with the boring matters of state so that the newly-crowned emperor could enjoy all the pleasures available to them. The Silk Purse's High Council became the shadow rulers of the empire, while the emperor was merely a puppet. They passed greedy laws in the emperors' name, leaving the rulers none the wiser to the suffering their subjects endured, and three consecutive monarchs became known as the Egregious Emperors for the outrageousness of their rule. Sensing the unease, the Silk Purse fomented a rebellion, overthrowing the emperors in the name of the people and birthing the city-states and factions seen today. Seen as the common folks' saviour, the Silk Purse has since cemented itself as the financial lifeblood of the Realms.",
								"None of this is known, of course, for history is written by the victor. In the Pondermoss Weald, a vast forest filled with kodama and the tombs of great people, the Egregious Emperors were paid a final insult. Within the House of the Forgotten, a monastery in a distant corner of the weald dedicated to unremembered souls, the three corpses were unceremoniously inhumed. With their souls settled in a final resting place, the emperors learnt of the true happenings during their reign. They persisted as ghosts, intent on revealing the machinations of which they were previously unaware. For centuries, they wallowed in their self-pity, until, at last, an unsuspecting visitor arrived.",
								"Shan Reede, researcher for The Chroniclers and ex-professional bard, was intrigued by the deceased rulers, individuals so narcissistic they had been buried in the furthest, highest reaches of the weald. She found their triptych of tombs nestled in the roots of an enormous goldenheart zelkova tree in the monastery's courtyard (see Flora, Fauna, & Things on page 90, and Ubusuna, page 247). Using historiomancy, a branch of divination magic, she discovered many truths about the emperors' existence and, at the end of each day's research, she penned their tale into a song.",
								"As the emperors' spirits listened to Shan Reede's song, they were appalled by the perceived inaccuracies of her lyrics\u2014they were heavily biased towards their own innocence\u2014 and appeared to her with notes and corrections. Over the following month, Shan developed the song, her bawdy ditty turning into a lengthy saga, and sent missives back to The Chroniclers describing 'revelatory discoveries about the Silk Purse's origin'. Unfortunately for her, the missives' details found their way to unfriendly ears, and the Silk Purse dispatched an assassin to ensure she died in an unavoidable accident.",
								"Shan Reede often returned to the Verdant Gorge to send messages to her superiors, collect supplies, and partake of some rest and relaxation before travelling back to the waiting emperors. When Shan did not return to the monastery, the emperors grew anxious that their tale would not be heard. Their desperate anger influenced the psychically porous kodama that infused the goldenheart zelkova. The enormous tree's roots writhed and pushed, wrenching free a quarter-mile chunk of rock, trees, and earth: an ubusuna kaiju! Now the kaiju, known to the locals as the Wandering Earth, roams the weald in search of the lost chronicler, leaving a trail of destruction in its wake. Moreover, where it roams, kodama become fearful and defensive, animating plants that lash out at the people who once acted as the forest's caretakers.",

An ancient crown or a kaiju's bone would allow a historiomancer to observe the scene through the eyes of the item or the creature from which the item came.

								"In the time when the Yokai Realms had emperors, the Silk Purse was not the powerhouse that it is today. Like all guilds, it began life as a collection of like-minded folks\u2014merchants seeking to establish norms for their trade and speak with a singular voice. But shrewd minds among their number devised a plan. With gifts of treasure and information, they gained access to the emperor's inner circle and, from this trusted position, offered to teach the emperor's offspring the ways of trade and finance. Instead of an education, these cunning advisors spoiled the emperor's children, instilling in them a love of hedonism rather than a respect for their rule.",
								"When each emperor passed, the guildsmen offered to deal with the boring matters of state so that the newly-crowned emperor could enjoy all the pleasures available to them. The Silk Purse's High Council became the shadow rulers of the empire, while the emperor was merely a puppet. They passed greedy laws in the emperors' name, leaving the rulers none the wiser to the suffering their subjects endured, and three consecutive monarchs became known as the Egregious Emperors for the outrageousness of their rule. Sensing the unease, the Silk Purse fomented a rebellion, overthrowing the emperors in the name of the people and birthing the city-states and factions seen today. Seen as the common folks' saviour, the Silk Purse has since cemented itself as the financial lifeblood of the Realms.",
								"None of this is known, of course, for history is written by the victor. In the Pondermoss Weald, a vast forest filled with kodama and the tombs of great people, the Egregious Emperors were paid a final insult. Within the House of the Forgotten, a monastery in a distant corner of the weald dedicated to unremembered souls, the three corpses were unceremoniously inhumed. With their souls settled in a final resting place, the emperors learnt of the true happenings during their reign. They persisted as ghosts, intent on revealing the machinations of which they were previously unaware. For centuries, they wallowed in their self-pity, until, at last, an unsuspecting visitor arrived.",
								"Shan Reede, researcher for The Chroniclers and ex-professional bard, was intrigued by the deceased rulers, individuals so narcissistic they had been buried in the furthest, highest reaches of the weald. She found their triptych of tombs nestled in the roots of an enormous goldenheart zelkova tree in the monastery's courtyard (see Flora, Fauna, & Things on page 90, and Ubusuna, page 247). Using historiomancy, a branch of divination magic, she discovered many truths about the emperors' existence and, at the end of each day's research, she penned their tale into a song.",
								"As the emperors' spirits listened to Shan Reede's song, they were appalled by the perceived inaccuracies of her lyrics\u2014they were heavily biased towards their own innocence\u2014 and appeared to her with notes and corrections. Over the following month, Shan developed the song, her bawdy ditty turning into a lengthy saga, and sent missives back to The Chroniclers describing 'revelatory discoveries about the Silk Purse's origin'. Unfortunately for her, the missives' details found their way to unfriendly ears, and the Silk Purse dispatched an assassin to ensure she died in an unavoidable accident.",
								"Shan Reede often returned to the Verdant Gorge to send messages to her superiors, collect supplies, and partake of some rest and relaxation before travelling back to the waiting emperors. When Shan did not return to the monastery, the emperors grew anxious that their tale would not be heard. Their desperate anger influenced the psychically porous kodama that infused the goldenheart zelkova. The enormous tree's roots writhed and pushed, wrenching free a quarter-mile chunk of rock, trees, and earth: an ubusuna kaiju! Now the kaiju, known to the locals as the Wandering Earth, roams the weald in search of the lost chronicler, leaving a trail of destruction in its wake. Moreover, where it roams, kodama become fearful and defensive, animating plants that lash out at the people who once acted as the forest's caretakers.",

An ancient crown or a kaiju's bone would allow a historiomancer to observe the scene through the eyes of the item or the creature from which the item came.

When Raiko, blinded by his own rage, passed into the Material Plane mid-squall, he became lost.

An enormous eruption turned the charred plains into a tremendous caldera some twenty miles wide, darkening the sky in a period known as The Ashfall and making refugees of all those who resided there.",

From within the now-cooled caldera, huge spires of rock reached for the sky like saplings, some extending over a mile above the ringwall before their mineral-rich rock was sheared by the tempests of the high skies. The bounty of the ore in the caldera became fabled, and Humanoids returned, naming the caldera Tetsumine Basin and making a labyrinthine home of tunnels and mines within the spires. Atop the peak of each mine-spire was a shrine to Raiko, a place where offerings might be made to appease the Herald of Storms whose fury could break their needle-like abodes.",

As the transelemental portal entered the Plane of Water, the caldera began to fill.

An ancient crown or a kaiju's bone would allow a historiomancer to observe the scene through the eyes of the item or the creature from which the item came.

An enormous eruption turned the charred plains into a tremendous caldera some twenty miles wide, darkening the sky in a period known as The Ashfall and making refugees of all those who resided there.",

From within the now-cooled caldera, huge spires of rock reached for the sky like saplings, some extending over a mile above the ringwall before their mineral-rich rock was sheared by the tempests of the high skies. The bounty of the ore in the caldera became fabled, and Humanoids returned, naming the caldera Tetsumine Basin and making a labyrinthine home of tunnels and mines within the spires. Atop the peak of each mine-spire was a shrine to Raiko, a place where offerings might be made to appease the Herald of Storms whose fury could break their needle-like abodes.",

As the transelemental portal entered the Plane of Water, the caldera began to fill.

Though a good-natured rivalry developed between spirefolk and the ringlanders\u2014those who made homes on the caldera's cliff-like ringwall\u2014the two developed a symbiotic relationship: the ringlanders trade wood and food for the ore, ingots, and artifices of the spirefolk.

An ancient crown or a kaiju's bone would allow a historiomancer to observe the scene through the eyes of the item or the creature from which the item came.

When Raiko, blinded by his own rage, passed into the Material Plane mid-squall, he became lost. As his anger grew, the squall became a storm, and then a tempest\u2014an unending churning of the skies that wandered the Yokai Realms, looking for a route home.",

On the Shinihai Flats, great tectonic pressures spewed forth plumes of molten rock and poisonous fumes; wildfires raged, and the area was a hub of volcanic activity. An enormous eruption turned the charred plains into a tremendous caldera some twenty miles wide, darkening the sky in a period known as The Ashfall and making refugees of all those who resided there.",

From within the now-cooled caldera, huge spires of rock reached for the sky like saplings, some extending over a mile above the ringwall before their mineral-rich rock was sheared by the tempests of the high skies. The bounty of the ore in the caldera became fabled, and Humanoids returned, naming the caldera Tetsumine Basin and making a labyrinthine home of tunnels and mines within the spires. Atop the peak of each mine-spire was a shrine to Raiko, a place where offerings might be made to appease the Herald of Storms whose fury could break their needle-like abodes.",

As the transelemental portal entered the Plane of Water, the caldera began to fill. The deeper into the plane that the portal travelled, the higher the water rose in the caldera, until a lake as vast as the basin was borne: Lake Tetsugan. Though a good-natured rivalry developed between spirefolk and the ringlanders\u2014those who made homes on the caldera's cliff-like ringwall\u2014the two developed a symbiotic relationship: the ringlanders trade wood and food for the ore, ingots, and artifices of the spirefolk.

An ancient crown or a kaiju's bone would allow a historiomancer to observe the scene through the eyes of the item or the creature from which the item came.

								"Since the birth of the Yokai Realms, the clashing of kaiju has created mountains, ravines, and deserts as these manifestations of land, water, and sky battle one another. Few kaiju are more territorial than Nomi, the Quaking Earth, an immense arthropod said to carry the tenacity of all insects, arachnids, and crustaceans in the world. Since Nomi was last slain a millennium ago, the Realms have enjoyed a period of peace and geological stability. But, as is the way of the world, Nomi was re-birthed from the earth and has recently emerged from their chrysalis after spending several centuries as a larva.",
								"During that peaceful millennium, Humanoids discovered the Tofuoka Hills and its unique resources: readygrown housing, easily tamed giant beetles, and a plentiful supply of sulphur, a key component of the explosives manufactured by the College of Hanabi. They built the city of Kihōsō amongst the region's rolling hills and, until recently, have shared a prosperous, if malodorous, existence.",
								"Upon hatching, Nomi's first imperative has been to find and create a suitable spot to spawn. Like all kabuto, Nomi's eggs need an acidic substrate in which to gestate, and they have spent the past few months travelling between deep sulphur deposits, which they consume to create acid, and an enormous aquifer, which they acidify. Though Nomi's subterranean movements initially resulted in several earthquakes, these subsided once Nomi established their route, much to the relief of the Kihosan people. However, a second calamity was soon to befall them.",
								"Surface water from the Tofuoka Hills isn't potable due to the prevalence of sulphur and the biological imperative of local female arthropods to acidify water in preparation for spawning. To circumvent this, extraordinarily deep wells have been dug throughout the region to tap into an enormous underground aquifer situated below layers of impermeable rock. The vastness of this body of water is far bigger than any kabuto could acidify on its own. Any kabuto, that is, except for Nomi.",
								"Able to produce enough eggs to fill a harbour, Nomi has requisitioned Kihōsō's main water supply as their spawning pool and has steadily increased its acidity. The water has become undrinkable; the town's emergency water supply, a stepped well used as a temple to the north of the city, is running low and, as usual, the poorest are suffering.",
								"Sensing opportunity, the Silk Purse has begun to caravan in potable water to sell at eye-watering prices. Some common folk are turning to the Horn Pits, a bloodsport-focused gambling den, as a last-ditch attempt at changing their fortune. With many falling into debt, the whole city could soon descend into a crime slum, with fresh water the currency of choice. Fortunately, a zoologist named Dr. Doolots has collaborated with the Heirs of Kirin to create a device capable of neutralising large bodies of water, and she intends to deal with the problem at its source.",

In the wild, kabuto are docile creatures that gather dung to trade with a specific type of Alveolus plant that releases a sugary nectar after receiving nitrogen waste. Female kabuto break from this work when they approach their breeding season, at which time they burrow underground to consume sulphur in preparation for making sulphuric acid. When they find a suitable body of water\u2014not too big, not too small\u2014they begin to spray acid over it. This acidifies the water in a way that allows their eggs, when laid, to properly gestate, and it prevents other creatures from accessing them. This spraying action also releases pheromones, which attracts males of the species. See the entry on page 231 for more on Kabuto. Nomi, a cousin of the Kabuto, shares much of the kabuto morphology but is hermaphroditic, displaying both male and female traits."

And the foe is enormous! A huge kabuto, bigger than those in the bouts so far, squeezes into the northern cage, its iridescent maroon shell streaked with veins of turquoise. As the lights dim, a hush falls over the crowd. The click of the ronin unsheathing their katana a quarter inch echoes around the theatre as two spotlights are lit: one on the ronin, the second on the kabuto.",
												"The cage doors slam open, and the kabuto stumbles forward onto the sand of the arena floor. It shifts its head side to side, huge horn a metronome of destruction, before its beady eyes focus on the ronin who stands, unmoving. The kabuto lowers its head. One of its six legs paws at the ground. The warrior shifts their feet, their body taking on the whipcord anticipation of a drawn bow. The kabuto charges and, with delicate grace, the ronin pirouettes to one side, hand never leaving hilt. The kabuto, head lowered and beady eyes obscured, continues its charge headfirst into the southern wall with a resounding crash. The theatre shakes, and the crowd lets out a chorus of appreciative 'oohs'.",
												"Dazed, the kabuto reorients itself. Its armoured carapace cracks open, revealing two shimmering wings like crystalline mirrors. The ronin adjusts position once more, hand tightening on sword handle. The kabuto leaps and the room is suddenly a kaleidoscope of colour as its double-wings unfurl to create a deep buzz. In a fluid motion, the warrior unsheathes their katana into a two-handed grip, executes a looping double-slash, and resheathes their blade. The two wings fall gently to the ground as the kabuto crashes into the sand, gouging a deep trough. A pause. The crowd erupts in deafening applause. The ronin bows once, the first time they've acknowledged the crowd, takes up their cloak, and leaves."

Chūji's family struggled and, as a teen, Chūji was caught stealing food several times and eventually sentenced to death. But this was not the end; a member of the Blossoms saw in Chūji the spark of rebellion and had a druid reincarnate them. Chūji's soul, which had once occupied the body of a halfling male, found life again as a nishikin female",

They were subjected to a strict regimen, learning noble etiquette and language, kendo and archery, and economics and tactics. In a short time, they acquired the skills required to blend in as a noble of the Realms and attended a boarding school where they ingratiated themself with the cream of the aristocratic crop.",

The internal landscape is one of plots within plots, with power shifting as easily as sand.

Once this was achieved, they distracted the rulers with hedonism and luxury, passing favourable laws in the emperors' name. Eventually, the Realms fell into rebellion and, sensing the turning of the tide, the Silk Purse overthrew the final emperor, Tokihito, in the name of the people. Since then, they have been remembered as saviours, rather than the conniving tyrants they were.",

Then, when the wayhouses are no longer manned and the patrols don't keep watch, they pay outlaws to raid trade caravans and villages, and even commit arson.

								"Since the birth of the Yokai Realms, the clashing of kaiju has created mountains, ravines, and deserts as these manifestations of land, water, and sky battle one another. Few kaiju are more territorial than Nomi, the Quaking Earth, an immense arthropod said to carry the tenacity of all insects, arachnids, and crustaceans in the world. Since Nomi was last slain a millennium ago, the Realms have enjoyed a period of peace and geological stability. But, as is the way of the world, Nomi was re-birthed from the earth and has recently emerged from their chrysalis after spending several centuries as a larva.",
								"During that peaceful millennium, Humanoids discovered the Tofuoka Hills and its unique resources: readygrown housing, easily tamed giant beetles, and a plentiful supply of sulphur, a key component of the explosives manufactured by the College of Hanabi. They built the city of Kihōsō amongst the region's rolling hills and, until recently, have shared a prosperous, if malodorous, existence.",
								"Upon hatching, Nomi's first imperative has been to find and create a suitable spot to spawn. Like all kabuto, Nomi's eggs need an acidic substrate in which to gestate, and they have spent the past few months travelling between deep sulphur deposits, which they consume to create acid, and an enormous aquifer, which they acidify. Though Nomi's subterranean movements initially resulted in several earthquakes, these subsided once Nomi established their route, much to the relief of the Kihosan people. However, a second calamity was soon to befall them.",
								"Surface water from the Tofuoka Hills isn't potable due to the prevalence of sulphur and the biological imperative of local female arthropods to acidify water in preparation for spawning. To circumvent this, extraordinarily deep wells have been dug throughout the region to tap into an enormous underground aquifer situated below layers of impermeable rock. The vastness of this body of water is far bigger than any kabuto could acidify on its own. Any kabuto, that is, except for Nomi.",
								"Able to produce enough eggs to fill a harbour, Nomi has requisitioned Kihōsō's main water supply as their spawning pool and has steadily increased its acidity. The water has become undrinkable; the town's emergency water supply, a stepped well used as a temple to the north of the city, is running low and, as usual, the poorest are suffering.",
								"Sensing opportunity, the Silk Purse has begun to caravan in potable water to sell at eye-watering prices. Some common folk are turning to the Horn Pits, a bloodsport-focused gambling den, as a last-ditch attempt at changing their fortune. With many falling into debt, the whole city could soon descend into a crime slum, with fresh water the currency of choice. Fortunately, a zoologist named Dr. Doolots has collaborated with the Heirs of Kirin to create a device capable of neutralising large bodies of water, and she intends to deal with the problem at its source.",

When they find a suitable body of water\u2014not too big, not too small\u2014they begin to spray acid over it. This acidifies the water in a way that allows their eggs, when laid, to properly gestate, and it prevents other creatures from accessing them. This spraying action also releases pheromones, which attracts males of the species. See the entry on page 231 for more on Kabuto.

It shifts its head side to side, huge horn a metronome of destruction, before its beady eyes focus on the ronin who stands, unmoving. The kabuto lowers its head. One of its six legs paws at the ground. The warrior shifts their feet, their body taking on the whipcord anticipation of a drawn bow. The kabuto charges and, with delicate grace, the ronin pirouettes to one side, hand never leaving hilt. The kabuto, head lowered and beady eyes obscured, continues its charge headfirst into the southern wall with a resounding crash. The theatre shakes, and the crowd lets out a chorus of appreciative 'oohs'.",
												"Dazed, the kabuto reorients itself. Its armoured carapace cracks open, revealing two shimmering wings like crystalline mirrors. The ronin adjusts position once more, hand tightening on sword handle. The kabuto leaps and the room is suddenly a kaleidoscope of colour as its double-wings unfurl to create a deep buzz. In a fluid motion, the warrior unsheathes their katana into a two-handed grip, executes a looping double-slash, and resheathes their blade. The two wings fall gently to the ground as the kabuto crashes into the sand, gouging a deep trough. A pause. The crowd erupts in deafening applause. The ronin bows once, the first time they've acknowledged the crowd, takes up their cloak, and leaves."

This magic requires a focus, typically an item that was present during the events that are being investigated. An ancient crown or a kaiju's bone would allow a historiomancer to observe the scene through the eyes of the item or the creature from which the item came.

								"Since the birth of the Yokai Realms, the clashing of kaiju has created mountains, ravines, and deserts as these manifestations of land, water, and sky battle one another. Few kaiju are more territorial than Nomi, the Quaking Earth, an immense arthropod said to carry the tenacity of all insects, arachnids, and crustaceans in the world. Since Nomi was last slain a millennium ago, the Realms have enjoyed a period of peace and geological stability. But, as is the way of the world, Nomi was re-birthed from the earth and has recently emerged from their chrysalis after spending several centuries as a larva.",
								"During that peaceful millennium, Humanoids discovered the Tofuoka Hills and its unique resources: readygrown housing, easily tamed giant beetles, and a plentiful supply of sulphur, a key component of the explosives manufactured by the College of Hanabi. They built the city of Kihōsō amongst the region's rolling hills and, until recently, have shared a prosperous, if malodorous, existence.",
								"Upon hatching, Nomi's first imperative has been to find and create a suitable spot to spawn. Like all kabuto, Nomi's eggs need an acidic substrate in which to gestate, and they have spent the past few months travelling between deep sulphur deposits, which they consume to create acid, and an enormous aquifer, which they acidify. Though Nomi's subterranean movements initially resulted in several earthquakes, these subsided once Nomi established their route, much to the relief of the Kihosan people. However, a second calamity was soon to befall them.",
								"Surface water from the Tofuoka Hills isn't potable due to the prevalence of sulphur and the biological imperative of local female arthropods to acidify water in preparation for spawning. To circumvent this, extraordinarily deep wells have been dug throughout the region to tap into an enormous underground aquifer situated below layers of impermeable rock. The vastness of this body of water is far bigger than any kabuto could acidify on its own. Any kabuto, that is, except for Nomi.",
								"Able to produce enough eggs to fill a harbour, Nomi has requisitioned Kihōsō's main water supply as their spawning pool and has steadily increased its acidity. The water has become undrinkable; the town's emergency water supply, a stepped well used as a temple to the north of the city, is running low and, as usual, the poorest are suffering.",
								"Sensing opportunity, the Silk Purse has begun to caravan in potable water to sell at eye-watering prices. Some common folk are turning to the Horn Pits, a bloodsport-focused gambling den, as a last-ditch attempt at changing their fortune. With many falling into debt, the whole city could soon descend into a crime slum, with fresh water the currency of choice. Fortunately, a zoologist named Dr. Doolots has collaborated with the Heirs of Kirin to create a device capable of neutralising large bodies of water, and she intends to deal with the problem at its source.",

Female kabuto break from this work when they approach their breeding season, at which time they burrow underground to consume sulphur in preparation for making sulphuric acid. When they find a suitable body of water\u2014not too big, not too small\u2014they begin to spray acid over it. This acidifies the water in a way that allows their eggs, when laid, to properly gestate, and it prevents other creatures from accessing them. This spraying action also releases pheromones, which attracts males of the species. See the entry on page 231 for more on Kabuto. Nomi, a cousin of the Kabuto, shares much of the kabuto morphology but is hermaphroditic, displaying both male and female traits."

One of its six legs paws at the ground. The warrior shifts their feet, their body taking on the whipcord anticipation of a drawn bow. The kabuto charges and, with delicate grace, the ronin pirouettes to one side, hand never leaving hilt. The kabuto, head lowered and beady eyes obscured, continues its charge headfirst into the southern wall with a resounding crash.

The ronin adjusts position once more, hand tightening on sword handle. The kabuto leaps and the room is suddenly a kaleidoscope of colour as its double-wings unfurl to create a deep buzz. In a fluid motion, the warrior unsheathes their katana into a two-handed grip, executes a looping double-slash, and resheathes their blade. The two wings fall gently to the ground as the kabuto crashes into the sand, gouging a deep trough. A pause. The crowd erupts in deafening applause.

In this way, the genetic diversity of the population is maintained; a single clutch of eggs will see many males reign over it, ensuring that the hatched offspring have many different fathers.
