In fact, this couldn't be further from the truth: Szass Tam has, as he always does, gleaned methods by which to pervert a resource that he don't own so that he can bend it to his own nefarious ends.",

They have been irrevocably changed by their far-reaching dreams of conquest and their loyalty to Red Wizards and the greater glory of Thay itself. The raw power of the Weave, the fundamental arcane fabric that powers all magic across the Forgotten Realms, courses through the paladin and provides the lens through which they perceive the world. The protection and promotion of magic is their sworn goal, and they will go to any length to achieve it.",
				"Finally, and perhaps most importantly, a weavebound paladin is bound not only to the glory of Thay but also directly to a single zulkir. The secret of creating a weavebound paladin was until recently known only to Szass Tam, but others around the realms\u2014notably the Blackstaff in Waterdeep and Zulkir Dar'lon Ma of Mulmaster\u2014have begun to craft their own versions of this path. Still, there are those wary few across the Sword Coast and beyond who believe that Szass Tam merely leaked a corrupt version of the ritual into the world so that he might have more eyes and ears where he needs them most: adjacent to the most powerful casters that he does not already control.",

No other realm, with the mere naming of it, provokes such a visceral reaction. The bare utterance alone evokes images of terrible magics and hordes of terrifying undead. And that reputation is well earned. For decades the nation of Thay has schemed and meddled in the affairs of nations all across Faerûn.",

While Szass Tam and the Red Wizards certainly reign supreme, such matters have very little impact on day-to-day life in Thay.",

								"Well met, reader!",
								"Ye hold a tome both vitally necessary for those seeking to trade with the Land of the Red Wizards, and perilous to pen. Thayans of any era, from Thayd to the recent and all-roo-ruthless reign of that overreaching fool Szass Tam, are sensitive about anyone who reveals too much of their true nature and doings to outlanders.",
								"Fortunately, not only are the creative folk who've produced this book bold and inquisitive sorts, who've laid bare before ye more secrets of Thay than have ever before been assembled between any pair of covers, but I am also bold, inquisitive, and an overreaching fool to boot, so I will happily add to what they've written. So what shall I tell ye of Thay?",
								"Well, to begin, the average Thayan laborer and shopkeeper wants undamaged wares, and whole items; not for them the bolt of cloth from a distant land, to be cut and sewn, or a stack of tool-handles, for them to fit onto hammer-heads or pickheads or the like; they want to buy a whole and finished item.",
								"This same \"everyday\" Thayan likely hums tunes to themselves, short little melodies or harmonies playing on melodies they already know, and is likely to overhear other Thayans doing this as they work and travel\u2014with the result that these little tunes sweep the land. So don't go whistling or humming ditties to act nonchalant, or as code for traveling companions\u2014or ye may attract attentive interest from nearby Thayans, when ye'd rather not have it.",
								"This same everyday Thayan may well have a habit of chewing a weed that grows everywhere in Thay for the plucking; most do. The weed is thulfraz, and it looks like a spider on its back: eight dark green, thin stems sprouting from a central root-knob. Lemony-minty and yet a little like parsley, too. Thayans often chew as they work, like a cow masticating its cud.",
								"And when they're not chewing, they're drinking. Not always something strong, more often during the working day (dawn to dusk for most, mind ye) it'll be tea, hot or cold, and that tea will be elkammat. (Which is the standard drinking tea of the eastern Inner Sea, from Aglarond and Thay to the Vilhon; a brown, nutty tea brewed from the fibrous husks of groundnuts in Murghôm, Semphar, Mulhorand, Unther, and Chondath; woody and bitter, but usually sold \"adorned\" with subtle additions of spices like cinnamon and nutmeg, and the right mix of these can make it delightful.)",
								"And at meals, they need to drink something to cool the throat, as many of them drown their dishes in tart, fiery tamarind-dominated brown sauces, and marinade their fish and their fowl before cooking.",
								"Oh, and so used are Thayans to being spied upon by Red Wizards and their agents\u2014and if not that, spies for local tharchions and tharchionesses\u2014that everyone puts their heads together to share gossip, low-voiced. It's just become habit, and generations ago, so now they do it from birth without thinking.",
								"And ye may hear them call on Kossuth, for they daily purify household things, like needles and metal dishes that have been used to mix herbal remedies, by holding them in flame as they murmur, \"Antur daeya KOSSUTH\" in Thorass (\"Be here, to aid with your power, Kossuth\").",
								"And speaking of the gods, ye'll search in vain for an in-use public temple or shrine to, say, Mystra, but there are plenty of hidden family chapels (that non-family-members will not be invited into, nor will anyone formally confirm their existence), to all deities, for Thayans venerate (even if only to ward off disfavor, in small daily ways, like \"don't let dinner be burned\" or \"let no crockery be broken in this move\") all the gods. In the cities of Thay, Thayans find comfort in shared rituals of devotion. The sparsely-populated frontier tharches have small, simple unstaffed wayside shrines here and there, used for personal worship of whoever matters most to a Thayan praying there. The city of Eltabbar is the heart of religious power in Thay, the place where powerful clerics indulge in intrigues and endlessly refine and debate policy. Decrees go out from the highest-ranking priests in Eltabbar to everywhere else in Thay, because Eltabbar is where they meet, and where most of them dwell (when they're not living in their mansions in Thaymount, or elsewhere in Thay on holy business).",
								"Yet enough of the everyday; I've been told by the likes of Volo the Halfwit that readers thirst for adventure, so perhaps I'd best mention some of the thefts and treasure tales and unsolved mysteries of Thay that may yet spawn adventures. Some of which may even be survivable.",
								"So let it first be said that in the mountains that bound Thay to the east, that have variously been called the Sunrise Mountains or the Sunset Mountains\u2014 very Thayan, that; in rulership, they can't keep to one decision for long\u2014there are many tombs full of long-hidden magic. Enchanted items, that dead mages of early Thay were interred wearing, and whose magics have often transformed the dead into undead\u2014 lich-like, spellwielding unique undead, many of them. These are small tombs of a few chambers gouged out of cave walls, not grand buildings. A good thing, too, for even Red Wizards aren't quite so proudly unobservant and stupid as to not notice surface structures just sitting there.",
								"There's also the Whispering Ghost, which is an undead spirit actually more akin to a vampiric mist than what we usually call a \"ghost.\" Or rather, scores of such spirits, not a lone entity. Once they decide ye will make a good means of helping them become more powerful than they are, they hound ye, whispering to ye in dreams and when ye're alone, to try to goad ye into doing things that will aid them. They'll feed on others, but not ye, unless ye repudiate or try determinedly to destroy them. Many a Thayan is the driven tool of such a spirit, but they seem to seize upon visiting outlanders with especial eagerness.",
								"It would be remiss of me not to mention a somewhat similar whisperer, this one a lone lady: Qulone Trythkul\u2014that's \"koo-LOAN Trithh-KOOL\"\u2014who has passed into undeath. She was Szass Tam's lover, or one of them, long ago, and he tired of her and tricked her to her doom by getting her to retrieve for him a magical scepter whose touch ate living flesh. She wasted away after delivering it to him, but Tam overreached once more, for he'd not realized the scepter's magic would enmesh with the lady's own worn enchanted items, dissolving them but making her undead in the process as their magic sank into her very bones. She exists now to get her revenge on Tam, and may whisper to the living not just to do things that may harm him or his schemes, but also to aid them in escaping his minions and vengeance. Qulone's whispered counsel has rescued many outlanders and Thayan rebels alike from doom.",

Most of them still lie dark and waiting under the city's cobbles, and their own thick layers of dust, holding fistfuls of gems and only long-dead Thayan servants know what else.",

						"But this isn't entirely correct. While Thay is led by a group of evil mages, it is also home to thousands of innocent, hard-working people. The nation is perceived to be evil, but as with all things, perception is based only upon what people are allowed to witness. Those who explore Thay often find that it is filled with gentle, peaceful people that are content to fill their days with crafting and family.

Thanks to their upbringing, many tend to be arrogant, especially towards non-humans. Many Mulani view such as elves and halflings as equivalent to children, while gnomes and dwarves are often despised or driven away under pain of death. Other races like orcs, half-orcs, and centaurs are tolerated so long as the Mulani believe that they can be employed as useful, strong-backed individuals.",

They have very little natural black or dark brown body hair, which they are generally expected to keep closely shaved. As a result of a drought in Thay's past, the people typically oil any remaining hair that they have and bathe in scented oils that are later scraped off the body along with any dirt.",

Similarly, Red Wizards often have many tattoos signifying marks of mastery and prestige, but these are often far more detailed than those a Mulani Thayan might dare to acquire without truthfully earning them.

Zulkirs, tharchions and tharchionesses, and senior bureaucrats (sometimes referred to as Thaen) tend to be drawn from the ranks of the Mulani, first from the most financially successful, long-powerful, and haughty families like the houses of Cathyl, Iryleian, Thrond, and Valakkar, and secondly from individuals of outstanding personal drive and merit. As a result, there are very few lazy, corrupt, or incompetent administrators in Thay; those in power are efficient, insightful, and quick to act with precision.",

Unlike Rashemi in Rashemen and elsewhere, Thayan Rashemi shave their heads to emulate Mulani Thayans. Thayan Rashemi see themselves as the true heart and core of Thay's greatness, carrying the realm upon their backs and doing the work that is truly necessary\u2014for the Mulani lack the skills to properly feed themselves, build or make anything, or really function; all they know is how to decide and lead and boss others around, and so they are nothing without us to do the real work for them.

Today, however, Thay has become a dictatorship that is ruled by the undead lich Szass Tam, a tyrant who largely dictated policy to the Council of Zulkirs and appointed Red Wizards to it who would obey him.",
										"Despite his increasingly erratic and failed attempts to achieve godhood or at least far greater power, the beliefs of High Regent Szass Tam\u2014that the pursuit of greater mastery of the Art was the supreme aim in any existence, and that achieving undeath was the best way to do so, as it opened a personal portal to limitless power and opportunities\u2014have over time come to permeate Thayan society and thinking.",

Lichdom is offered only to natural-born masters of the Art, so their only benefit is the privilege of being a citizen; while this enables them to have a chance to accumulate wealth or petty local power, it simply fails to satisfy the deep and ravenous appetites that most Thayans possess.",
										"Over the passing years, whether supreme authority rested in the hands of Szass Tam or the Council, the social order in Thay below the rank of Zulkir remained much the same, though the true authority of tharchions was steadily eroding. The Red Wizards are on top, with their own hierarchy descending from Zulkir and their spies and enforcers to senior mages of each school, then the rank-and-file experienced mages, down through the novices.",
										"Below the Red Wizards come the rest of the nobility: the Mulani tharchions, bureaucrats, sages, priests, and the richest merchant families, the houses who invest in the businesses of lesser merchants and are landlords to most Thayans dwelling in cities. Beneath these are the military commanders and veteran soldiers of Thay, who may or may not be Mulani nobles, for over time Thay has learned the hard way to reward merit and experience in their military.",
										"Then come the rest of the merchants, enjoying a status in society commensurate with their personal wealth, influence, and achievements. Engineers and owners of forges and construction materials and warehouses rank highly, mingled among the best artisans and craftworkers. Beneath them stand the most successful shopkeepers, more than a few of whom own chains of outlets, and proprietors of currently-popular city eateries. This middle class are Mulani, Rashemi, and mixed-lineage humans, and at the bottom of it are apprentices, skilled laborers, and crafters.",

										"Finally, underpinning everything in Thay, are the many, many slaves. Some through long service have won some measure of trust and are allowed to work under light or no supervision\u2014but slaves are never freed in Thay; they always belong to someone, and upon the death of an owner are inherited by someone else or seized by a creditor. In recent years it has become less acceptable to bring in new slaves, and even less palatable to have living slaves\u2014the upkeep simply isn't worth it in the minds of many of the eldest Thayans\u2014and so the market for undead servitors has been on the rise. This, coupled with a younger populace that is becoming more and more impactfully vocal about the need to prove Thay's value through direct action rather than on the backs of slaves may put the very concept of slave ownership in question.",

Almost every Thayan cook has family recipes for rathaek that they swear by, but although these vary widely in heat, they tend to be similar in overall flavor profile. Rarthaek is poured on a dish when it's ready to serve, and the \"iron-throated\" will even add more at the table for \"a good deep burn,\" but there are also kitchen sauces, or \"ulvurr,\" that begin as lemon juice and wine mixes, are thickened with what we would call a roux and a Thayan cook would call a \"dusult\" (\"Dusult it more\u2014that's a thin as a child's spit!

In our real world, these are usually called tajines or tagines, but they are always singular (tapering smoothly to a single chimney or spout). Thayan versions are called \"phalou\" (singular and plural are the same word), and consist of lipped bases (so a phalou placed over a metal dish will rest on its rim and also overlap it on the outside) of standard sizes, and straight edges so several can be placed touching each other down the length of a long metal cooking-dish (resulting in complete coverage, and a row of two or up to four parallel chimneys).",

This large many-axled wagon has huge tree-trunk wheels and is fitted with giant pickaxes chained to hand-cranked rotating drums, so as the drum turns a forest of flailing pickaxes screechingly descends and rebounds, attacking a rock surface. Then the flail-wagon moves on, and the rock is soaked with jets of water hand-pumped from water-tank wagons. Then a low-level wizard casts a spell to turn the soaked-in water to ice, so this ice cracks the rock internally as it expands, and then teams with three-man-long prybars and hammers and splitting wedges go in and break open that area.",

Each upspar has jointed arms ending in rock-scoop buckets, that descend from pivots in a collar-sleeve atop the upright spar, this bucket-arm is guided by workers on the ground around using pull-chains. The bucket is ridden by one person, who with cords guides its scooping motion, and opens and closes the bucket.",

										"In infancy, every Thayan resident, citizens and visitors alike, are tested by Red Wizards to see if they possess the Gift to practice magic. In rare circumstances a person may be given a second test when they first enter into adulthood. Beyond these times the Red Wizards deem magic to be soured or lost.",
										"The first test is almost always delivered covertly and by surprise, letting the youngling encounter subtle active magic in play to see if they sense anything about it, or can affect it. This may take the form of a spell involving warmth or radiance, or an enchanted item that glows and can be turned on or off, or the glow altered in intensity or hue. These are rarely complex enchantments but are always configured to be manipulatable by someone strong in the Art. Successful or not, this will be followed by a formal test done by two or more Red Wizards in which the youngling's status is tracked in a register, so that they may be identified for their as magical threat and potential. The chief fear of all Red Wizards is unrecognized, potentially hostile wizards or sorcerers of power dwelling in Thay, in their very midst.",
										"If a young person has no discernable Gift or affinity or magic, no wild talent or psionic ability or sensitivity to magic, they are steered into tutelage intended to discover what they do have a knack for, so they can be shaped into becoming a craftworker, scribe, or other useful member of Thayan society. If they do have the Gift, they are removed from their current family and situation and are reared by Red Wizards and nurses under the command of Red Wizards.",
										"This controlled upbringing, away from family and wider Thayan society, is intended first and foremost to instill loyalty to Thay. This includes not just the land or the nation of Thayans, but also the hierarchy of Red Wizards, their role in safeguarding all of Thay against treachery from non-wizards high (ambitious tharchions and nobility) and low (such as disaffected poor farmers and citizens of little power), as well as \"outlander spies of rival realms jealous of our achievements, who work tirelessly to weaken us.\" Red Wizards are taught that Aglarond, Rashemen, and Mulhorand all want the Red Wizards gone so they can conquer Thay, and that distant financial rivals like Baldur's Gate, Sembia, Waterdeep, and the Zhentarim all want to slyly dominate or come to own Thayan assets, and thus are constantly seeking to blackmail Thayans into acting for them, and that the nearby ruling dragons of Murghôm would pounce on Thay to hunt humans at will were it not for the deterrance the Red Wizards offer by their very presence.",
										"As this training proceeds, individuals are given chances to betray their tutors and Thay and Red Wizards\u2014 and then caught and slain ruthlessly, or transformed into bestial forms to be caged and displayed in front of fellow students as grim warnings of what happens to traitors.",
										"They will also be firmly taught that their deepest loyalty is to Szass Tam, then the Zulkir of the school of magic they're specializing in, then all other Zulkirs as the most senior \"other\" Red Wizards, then Red Wizards according to rank (position in the hierarchy). This is the true loyalty to Thay, not devotion to a banner or patch of ground or a city.",
										"Strife over policy within the ranks of the Red Wizards is tolerated, above a certain level (lower ranks are to obey, not question), and sometimes dissent is passed off as deliberately-arranged training exercises designed to uncover weaknesses and meritorious qualities. More serious and violent duels and murders and clashes among Red Wizards are seen as the acts of traitors who are mentally ill, thanks to their treachery festering inwardly until it breaks forth\u2014for only the insane would question their purposes, their fitness to rule, and their plans and strivings for a brighter future.",

								"In the olden days, Red Wizards of the various schools of magic sought to capture potential Red Wizards who showed skills in their school for training and rearing and eliminate strong-in-the-Art individuals who showed aptitude for other schools, but Szass Tam put a stop to that as he tightened his open rule, as these habits weakened the Red Wizards as a whole. Now, training is a mixture of math and history (strong on the \"We are Thay, and Thay is the feared and unappreciated light of an ignorant world\" indoctrination), languages, and trade skills, with a broad range of magical testing sprinkled among the other tutoring to reveal what sort of schools of magic a given student is good at.",
								"Once this personal aptitude is revealed, Red Wizards are formally entered into their education. They are taught with exhaustive, repetitive practice under supervision. They are given and expected to master not just a basic roster of relevant-to-them useful spells, but also to cast these magics in precisely the same way each and every time.",
								"Red Wizards at lower levels are actively discouraged when it comes to experimentation with existing spells and are not permitted to create new magics or variants; they're told that this is dangerous to them and to everyone around them. Simply put, those that pursue such foolish notions are irresponsible and reckless at a minimum, or are fools and if pursued anyway are traitors to be hunted down and destroyed.",
								"When experimentation is allowed, it is under the direct and constant supervision of a senior Red Wizard who has authority over the experimenters. The intent is to keep Red Wizards loyal above all, with a conformity of obedience so they will make not just the right decisions in a combat situation, but react in the \"right\"\u2014that is, as expected by superiors\u2014way. This is one important instance of how Red Wizards differ from the Zhentarim, with their open intriguing for advancement, and the War Wizards of Cormyr, where conformity has long been seen as a weakness any enemy can exploit."

A Red Wizard is also trained to try to \"read\" facial expressions, movements, and tones of voice to try to tell what a stranger is likely thinking, or about to do, or their attitude towards the Red Wizard or others. They are taught always to be alert, aware of surroundings including escape routes, possible nearby foes or hazards, and potential attack vectors, and to pay attention, even in crowded streets or markets, of movements and stealthy behavior\u2014all without seeming to watch. So many Red Wizards encountered outside of Thay are apt to be ready when surprise-attacked, because to them attack really wasn't a surprise, but perpetually anticipated.",
								"And lastly, every Red Wizard is encouraged to develop their own side-interests or hobbies, anything from collecting tiny carved figurines to covertly assembling valuable Sembian urban real estate. Zulkirs have long seen that this cuts down on treachery and rash acts by giving Red Wizards an outlet for stress and anger, a feeling (however false; as Dove Falconhand once put it, \"the only retired Red Wizards are the dead ones that have the good sense to stay dead\") that there's something for them to escape to if they ever tire of being a Red Wizard or things get too hot for them, and side expertise that can serve them well as they serve Thay. Having a Red Wizard who can fix a leaky boat, pick a lock, or successfully impersonate a courtier of a different land and gender can be very useful in advancing Thayan interests.",

This label is important for two reasons: firstly, in that it is not inaccurate due to Thay's history as a nation of conquerors and instigators as they seek out magic and territory across Faerun; and secondly, in that it is not entirely accurate.",
								"The Thayans use war engines, monsters, highly trained arcanists, and the like in their conquests. But they also use common people that have been pressed into service, given hollow offers of land ownership or citizenship, or have been otherwise coerced into military service. And those that don't serve in the military directly may find themselves toiling endlessly under the yoke of Thay's exorbitant taxes and living fees, straining to provide for themselves and their families as those above them in the hierarchy grow fat, lazy, and mean thanks to their efforts. Still, the nations of the world that are aware of these injustices are extremely hesitant to strike at Thay to resolve the matter as time and again, the zulkirs have demonstrated that they are willing to sacrifice their own people in defense of the nation and their ideals.",
								"To say that rebellion is brewing is an understatement. Hidden enclaves of citizens of Thay exist through the tharches, especially around the larger cities, that are beginning to suspect that Szass Tam's inability to gain a decisive victory against Rashemen, the Wychlaran, or even the Zhentarim mercenaries, is a clear sign that the current leadership council is more focused on preserving their own local power than promoting the interests of the nation at large. It has not gone unnoticed that many of the zulkirs have remained entirely within the nation's borders for many years, unlike in the past where a Zulkir would visit Waterdeep or Baldur's Gate at times, or even lead attacks in the greater world.",
								"Alongside the emerging groups of concerned citizens are a small but influential group of Thayan expatriates. These individuals have enmeshed themselves in the ongoing political schemes of the world at-large, with many of them referring to themselves as zulkirs. These people may or may not have legitimate claim to these titles. Perhaps they're merely separatists, desperate to depose the ancient lich and take control of the plateau. Perhaps they're legitimate zulkirs, unable or unwilling to return to Thay until some mission is completed. Only time\u2014and Szass Tam\u2014will tell.",
								"The lich and his inner circle of zulkirs that remain within the borders of Thay are thoroughly embroiled in their own power struggles and efforts. Periodically rumors of a Zulkir being supplanted may reach the ears of the outside world, but Szass Tam maintains a tight grip on such communications. As far as the world knows, the zulkirs presented elsewhere in this chapter represent the current list of people in charge of Thay."

								"Laraer (\"lahr-AIR\") is a Thayan dialect word meaning \"big change\" or \"life change\" or \"new direction in life.\" Although this term can be broadly applied, the people of Thay refer to one specific event as \"{@i the} laraer.\"",
								"Some 150 years prior to today, an event known as the Spellplague ripped through Faerûn. Magic was undone and the Weave began to spew wild threads of arcane power across the whole of the world. During this time many Red Wizards of Thay found their minds broken and an unknown number of arcanists died as their spells failed or turned against them. This event broke Thay's power structure and nearly broke its people.",
								"Arguably, no individual in Thay was more deeply affected than Szass Tam, the ancient lich that ruled the nation. His magic became unreliable and his attention and concentration, which had previously allowed him to juggle many schemes and magical experimentations were shattered. No longer could he magically spy on the important players in Thayan politics and society; no longer could he abide neither the presence nor even the sight of undead creatures\u2014especially those that he had created, for now that magic was unraveling, the protections he had woven into the spells that animated them were becoming undone, and some became mindless killing machines while others were granted their free will once more.",
								"For a time, Thay was effectively on its own. And Thayans, who live to inhale, eat, and drink intrigues and schemes, did not sit idle in this time of chaos and ruling weakness. Red Wizards at a stroke lost their supremacy, and many learned the hard way that slaves, upon whose backs the nation of Thay had been built, bear no burden of historic gratitude when a chance at freedom is presented. In a dramatically short time, an immense amount of scores were settled, \"accidents\" occurred to Red Wizards, manors were thoroughly destroyed, and trade organizations were subjected to what the rest of the world politely referred to as \"a series of hostile takeovers.\" As the wizards flailed for stability, the outside world simply waited and watched. Such actions weren't limited to the Thaymount and surrounding tharches. All across the world, Thayan enclaves and centers of power were realized to be finally vulnerable. Many were outright destroyed and nearly all were looted. Those Thayans that lived outside of the nation's borders knew fear in those dark days, fear that was justified and well-deserved.",
								"The nobles of Thay, who'd long resented being shoved aside from the reins of power, saw a chance to regain power and influence at the expense of Red Wizards within reach. Every dead Red Wizard is one less spy and agent for Szass Tam, and a chance for a noble to make decisions or enrich themselves instead. Many Red Wizards were hunted by a flood of hired assassins; for the first year of the Spellplague's raging, it seemed that any Red Wizard was a suitable target. Adventurers made for prime bounty hunters, and organizations like the Harpers and Emerald Enclave made no secret of their attempts to further destabilize the region.",
								"Thayans who didn't happen to be either noble or Red Wizards saw chances to redress slights and wrongs, and went after Red Wizards, too. They also realized the danger and increasing expense of keeping live slaves. The historic mindset of unthinking acceptance of slavery as \"the way society works, and should\" was wiped away, and in that shattering of the status quo and its acceptance, many Thayans started to think energetically and seriously about change in Thay, and a different country in the future. The remaining Red Wizards felt that they had made a pragmatic shift in their processes and culture but had unwittingly set the stage for true societal advancement by this course of action.",
								"Thayan change\u2014laraer\u2014was everywhere, inside Thay and all across Faerûn. Szass Tam's ever-tightening grip on power changed in nature and might, reliance on slaves and their numbers declined sharply, intrigues and grand dreams among \"just plain folks\" soared, and Szass Tam discovered that the obedient undead Zulkirs he'd installed in his ruling council lacked vision, imagination, ambition and the drive it fosters, and attentiveness to human nature; they repeatedly overlooked details, and didn't notice cabals and treachery beneath them, unless Szass Tam was at their sides, guiding them.

For all of Szass Tam's villainy and transgressions, he does indeed treasure his nation\u2014this love is second only to the love he feels for magic itself, and {@deity Mystra|Faerûnian|SCAG} by association. He tolerates the plots of the zulkirs until they cross the line and directly threaten him or the well-being of Thay as a whole; when this happens, he is unhesitant and total in his retaliation.",

Unknown to the general populace, Szass has recently closed the borders to the nation for his zulkirs. They are not permitted to travel outside of the nation, even via magic, as he works to consolidate his power and smooth the operations of the people and the state. By expelling an offending Red Wizard and cutting them off from support, he knows that they will have many challenges in the outside world and, down deep in his mind, that if they return empowered and emboldened then perhaps it is truly the will of {@deity Mystra|Faerûnian|SCAG} that they should do so.",
								"Szass's stance in politics and the control of trade in and out of the nation has led to uprisings from the citizenry on more than one occasion in the past. The most recent uprising is led in spirit by a Red Wizard in Mulmaster by the name of Dar'lon Ma. Dar'lon has claimed the title of Zulkir of enchantment and has been working with other Red Wizards that are not present upon the plateau to create his own council of zulkirs. He plots to one day storm Thaymount and slay Szass Tam so that Thay can return to its rightful place of glory among the Realms. Dar'lon and his compatriots have toiled long and hard to recover lost magic from ancient Netherese ruins, mind-shattering aberrant beings from beyond the stars, dead gods, and other sources to support and further their mission. As Red Wizards and even zulkirs cross or irritate Szass Tam and are expelled from Thay, he cautiously addresses them and explains his mission in an attempt to bring them into his fold. So far, his charismatic crusade has gained him a significant amount of power and followers. Dar'lon's rebellion isn't public knowledge and more often than not, if someone were to talk about a Thayan rebellion they would be dismissed as a crackpot or conspiracy theorist.",
								"As with the behavior of upstart zulkirs, Szass Tam tolerates Dar'lon Ma and his separatists. As of yet, they have not launched a decisive strike against Thaymount and as such the lich cares little for their squabbles and kingdom-building efforts. Even so, he is keenly aware of the fact that trouble is brewing for his beloved Thay and that he will once against be called upon by his people to protect them from forces they neither understand nor comprehend\u2014at least, this is what he tells himself. Heroes across the Forgotten Realms have found themselves enmeshed in this power struggle, and whether they know it or not, everyone has a part to play in the coming battles.",

He has, in recent years, sought to expand the criteria for becoming a zulkir largely due his realization that populating these roles with undead, including liches, only results in creating an echo chamber for his own plots and machinations.

Szass Tam has long held that only a school of magic is to have a Zulkir, but Dar'lon has expanded this model to include information as a school of thought rather than a school of magic. This is troublesome for the Red Wizards of the plateau, and while it shows some progressive thinking on Dar'lon's part, it also demonstrates his capacity for strategic thinking as he shapes his influence into a chokehold around Thay proper.",

To this day, the Athora lies in a cavern-lair deep inside Thaymount constructed by the Ba'etith, that mysterious group of sarrukh, batrachi and aearee who were responsible for the creation of the Nether Scrolls. Known as Assikhath to the sarrukh, the lair is adorned with statues that house protective and preservative magics (for some of the magic items in the lair are both powerful and dangerous; the Ba'etith didn't want them to fall into the hands of anyone unauthorized\u2014for such unwanted beings wouldn't know the secrets of how to bypass the defenses of the lair, and so would have to fight them). A few of these statues can animate as guardians, but most shoot forth magics to defend the lair against intruders, particularly those who seek to damage and despoil, or unleash magic. Most of these statues are of stylized sarrukh (snaked-headed lizards, giant serpents, or even winged upright bipeds with snake heads).",
								"Thayans of all walks of life (including wise, sophisticated zulkirs) associate magical power and success in the Art with the presence of such statues, so down the years similar statues have been fashioned and installed in many Thayan homes, compounds, and offices.

Curiously, these powerful denizens don't roam far, staying contained in the vicinity of the tattered towers of that place. Beyond, Delhumide today is the safest and most regimented of tharches, being \"under the eye\" of Thay's ruler Szass Tam.

The Probity Corps operates openly here and numerous other governmental spies canvas the city. This extends to Daerath Market\u2014the one place in the city where stalls and wagons crowd each other, streets becoming winding alleys between them. Daerath is where shady business can be conducted openly, adventurers may be found and hired, and so on, but sensible citizens know that the tharchion's spies are more attentive in Daerath than anywhere else.",

Deadly human-against-human duels have even been wagered on, though spell-duels have been strictly outlawed after several unfortunate fires and explosions.",
								"The infamous Deep Canal is also found here; it is a subterranean sewage circuit that is navigated by narrow barges poled by those who know its labyrinthine ways.

Whatever the truth of this, the rambling, many-times-expanded establishment has become notorious as a meeting ground for rivals and foes, a place where nigh any behavior is tolerated by the authorities due to the Inn's reputation as neutral ground. This neutrality makes it a place where gang leaders settle disputes with each other, Red Wizards not wanting to use magic meet to battle each other by other means, criminals trade contraband, make payments, and forge pacts, and outlanders meet with Thayans who don't want to be seen meeting with outlanders.

The strongest desires here are to keep Gauros as it is, not let cities and marching undead and lots of slaves and Red Wizards become numerous and dominant. Gaurans even push back against Thay's plans to \"garden\" Gauros by planting new trees and shrubs to make the more barren hills yield additional berries and timber, and breed and release animals to make game more plentiful.",
								"The Gorge of Gauros is the most widely-famous feature of the tharch; the river is cold and fast-flowing and alive with plentiful fish. In olden times, many gems were plucked out of the exposed rocks of the gorge walls on the dagger-points of casual passersby, but so many were taken that such activities now only reap rewards after one of the infrequent spring landslides. The stumps of several long-abandoned wizard's towers stand here and there in the Gorge, but these have been thoroughly picked over, leaving behind only the legends of what they once contained. Veteran Thayan soldiers\u2014and, if you can catch them after a few drinks, more than one Red Wizard\u2014will attest that some of the tales of mages' ghosts haunting the Gorge are true.",
								"Most of the ruins in the Gorge that are near the gorge-mouth are the foundations of old mills; one working mill survives, a sawmill that provides timbers to Surthay and Gauran boatbuilders. There's constant talk of rebuilding one of the stamping mills to crush ore, but it never seems to come to anything; local belief is that Red Wizards dwelling in wealthier tharches want ores smelted into pure metal in their own tharches, so they'll make the coin and not Gaurans.",
								"Perhaps the most famous such ruin is the Falcon Fang, an upjutting rock shaped like a giant tusk, that stands in the hills due east of Gauros Keep, about as far as one can travel before the hills give way to the rising rock flanks of the Sunset Mountains. The Falcon Fang has been a lair of both dragons and wyverns at various times past, and there are rumors of a well-hidden subterranean labyrinth beneath it that have long been used as a hidden brigand lair. These outlaws, it is said, raid the rest of Thay with great care and precision, taking only what they need and keeping as low of a profile as possible to mitigate the likelihood of hostile response from the Red Wizards. Sometimes referred to as \"The Quiet Claws,\" these outlaws are said to act to discredit or assassinate any Thayan who seems to have decided that they must be eradicated.",
								"Gauros is ruled from the frowning stone fortress of Gauros Keep, which features a well-armed and armored garrison of Thayan Knights. However, on their patrols, the Knights keep close to the Keep and seldom stray far from the dirt road linking the Keep with Denzar and the Daggertooth Pass.",

								"Laprendar has always been a popular destination for visiting outlanders. Its cities of Nethentir and Nethjet have always been centers of covert hostility to the Red Wizards and any authoritative rule from elsewhere in Thay. Szass Tam and the zulkirs know this, but have decided to rely on the Probity Corps' spies, covert assassins, and other agents of quiet warfare rather than to clamp down with military patrols or direct actions by the Red Wizards. Nonetheless, all senior Red Wizards know that \"the Neth\" (the folk of Nethentir and Nethjet) are a source of trouble with the ever-present promise of a brewing rebellion.",
								"Tam's policies on this region come from his recognition that Thay needs relief valves for wealth and ideas and strivings and influences from outside, both for morale reasons as well as to provide the Red Wizards with a method by which they can acquire exploitable goods and resources. Although any Thayan border port can and does serve this function, the relative isolation of Lapendrar from the wider Realms (as opposed to the southern port cities of Thay) means that outlanders and goods must travel longer distances under Thayan surveillance to reach the Neth cities, and so can be more easily noticed and\u2014if need be\u2014responded to.",
								"The eastern uplands of Lapendrar are ranchlands, open country, and small-hold farms. In recent years, Red Wizards have been ordered to work weather magic to provide enough dependable rainfall to keep the land from being parched. This has quelled much of the open mutterings against the red-robed mages or Tam's rule; most citizens in this tharch are fairly content because they feel they're largely being left alone and ignored by the mighty of Thay right now\u2014and that's the way they like things. What they do not want is any open conflict with Aglarond flaring up again, because this will turn Lapendrar into battlefields, mustering areas, and supply dumps, with Thayan armies trampling all the crops, eating all the ready food, and commandeering anything else they want. Similarly, they do not want to foment an open rebellion against the Szass Tam and the zulkirs for these same reasons.",
								"The city of Nethentir has always supported a thriving cluster of rival live theaters. The locals have a significant appetite for for tragedies and comedies, and especially savor sharp satires of Red Wizards and Thayan nobles. Nethentans like and frequently buy broadsheets, not just of news and gossip, but poetry and prose; there are even local traders and collectors of the written word. The city is a center of glass-blowing and staining, and of finework wood-carving and carpentry.",
								"The rival city of Nethjet has always been a center of innovation and mechanization. The city's residents have a love of assembly line processes and the creation of jigs and forms to assist with repeatable tasks. Fortunes have been made and many usefold household items that can be readily sold have been produced in Nethjet. It is also a place of workers' cabals, silent \"disappearances\" where unwanted individuals get strangled or drowned and then rendered down into locally-produced preserved food for export, and quiet local mercantile feuds.",

								"Priador is the most-recently founded tharch and is just over a century old. Originally consisting of just the city of Bezantur, the region was eventually expanded to encompass the surrounding coastal area as well. The tharch is now largely comprised of low-lying, cool-climate grassland rolling plains, verdant and green. Vegetation of all types flourishes here and has given rise to the Thayan saying \"Things grow with the blessings of all the gods in the Priador.\" This combined with three thriving port cities collectively called by some sailors of other lands \"the Jewels of Thay,\" has made Priador perennially one of the most prosperous parts of Thay.",
								"Much of this tharch is wilderland little touched by human alterations. Scores of Red Wizards claim parts of it, and many of these holdings consist of markers, fences, small private compounds, and lots of open land roamed by monsters captured and collected by these mages for use in arcane magical experiments. The monster presence restricts Priadoran citizens to the tharch's sole town of Anhaurz and its three cities, which are now all walled against marauding monster raids: Bezantur, Murbant, and Thasselen. As a result, some Priadorans feel spurned by, or at least cut off from, the rest of Thay. This has resulted in them resenting the authority of the Red Wizards but they've learned to do so silently.",
								"The brightest of the Jewels of Thay has always been Bezantur, known throughout Thay as \"the heart of Thay\" because it's where fashions are often set, where before the rise of the Red Wizards the nobility met to make pacts and decide policies, where in older times the largest slave markets were located, and where the makers of early Thayan culture were centered. Many bards and traveling merchant tale-tellers are also swift to point out that Bezantur is a place where any vice or depravity one can imagine can still be indulged in \"given the appropriate loosening of both morals and purse strings.\" It was also the center of early Thayan religion, which earned it the title of \"the City of a Thousand Temples.\" War or peace, good times or bad, Red Wizards or Szass Tam or not, Bezantur has been ever prosperous and has always flourished. It has grown in size and architectural magnificence, its older buildings being torn down and newer, taller ones put up in their places. As a result, it looms impressively (or forebodingly, depending on one's point of view) no matter what direction it is approached from. Bezantur has always been in love with the new, and it shows. Bezantans buy new clothes constantly, and new furniture often; they are among the few city-dwellers in the Realms to move to different domiciles frequently, almost always after purchasing a newer, grander residence or having one built for them.",
								"The city of Murbant is surrounded by the largest Red Wizard estates, and has been called \"the home of smugglers, traffickers of all types, and reeking fisherfolk,\" a dismissive reputation that has stuck. Most Thayans of every tharch save perhaps Gauros like to look down on Murbant, the \"Tainted Jewel.\" Some of the city's smugglers deal in kidnapped Thayans being rushed out of the realm while it's rumored that others specialize in capturing roaming beasts of the Red Wizard menageries, sailing them covertly and hastily elsewhere for sale in places like Chessenta, Westgate, or Sembia. The city is known for the many amethyst-hued domes of its homes that dominate the cityscape; local buildings are almost all domed and sport large oval windows.",
								"Thasselen's main site of interest to outlanders is Galauntowers, a mansion made over into six luxurious suites, but now abandoned thanks to a deadly spell-duel involving multiple mages and some strong local ward-spells that got twisted in the fighting, so that monsters controlled by the mages\u2014and, some say, the ghosts of apprentices slain in the fray\u2014now appear and disappear at random within its halls, stuck eternally in their cycle of casting, attacking, and falling in combat. The flickering, failing wards also disgorge dangerous magical discharges from time to time, without warning, and of course there are treasure-tales and wild stories of all of this magical mayhem being part of some grander scheme to lure outlander mages and Red Wizards alike into the clutches of whoever's in hiding and directing the wards as their own private magical weapons and outreaching arms.",

								"This tharch is full of rolling hills that are patrolled lightly from the city at its heart for which the entire region is named. Pyarados the city is what it has been from the start: two distinct cities, one a slowly-growing ring around the other. As it has been for centuries, the city remains sharply divided. The seat of power and local governance is the interior city, with tall, reinforced walls; it is clean, ordered, and luxurious, with wide avenues bordered by manicured parks that sprawl everywhere. The grounds of noble homes and Red Wizards' mansions maintain aggressively respectful separation so that no great house is close to another. Every such home has its stables, and lanes, and orchard-lined gardens and bowers, usually with fountain-fed pools. They give way to a narrow ring of balconied tallhouses around the inner wall. The wealthy and well-to-do merchants live in this crowded splendor as houses are scarce, fiercely sought-after, with most being purchased or otherwise appropriated by the nobles and Red Wizards immediately. In all, some four thousand souls dwell in \"the Bright Heart.\"",
								"Six gates pierce the walls, spoking major streets into the outer city. This outer ring of Pyarados is much larger than the Bright Heart and is ever-expanding, spilling outside the outer city walls to the east as opportunity and resources allow. The autarch of the city, a veteran soldier named Ularth Haeraundor, uses his soldiers to forcibly prevent any attempts to build to the west, southwest, and northwest, as this is fertile land needed to feed the city.",
								"Most farms in this tharch are in its westernmost lands, and are owned by the realm rather than a farmer or landholder; the farmers pay annual rents to work them. This outer ring of Pyarados is the Grimshield (just \"Shield\" in daily local speech) and is a dirty, crowded slum of unpaved, muddy winding alleys, ramshackle buildings that often collapse or lean groaningly against neighboring buildings, and lawless, grinding poverty; children scramble along the rooftops hurling stones at \"dungbirds\" (pigeons, as they're known in the Sword Coast). Many of these children behave as urchins, some rightfully so, and seek anything of value they can use, trade, or sell. Gangs roam the streets in the dark hours, battling each other for supremacy and a chance to raid any outlander goods left too lightly guarded. Justice in the Shield is still a matter of cudgels and swords, on the streets, not trials; trials are for the people of the Bright Heart and are rare even there, where quiet backroom deals settle most disputes, and the autarch exiles many unless overridden by the tharchion.",
								"Roughly sixty thousand folk dwell in the Shield, but no one properly counts \"dirty Shielders\" because to be counted is to be taxed, so the autarch really only knows the approximate count of how many building owners and official renters live in the outer part of his city.",
								"For years, Pyarados was sneered at by the rest of Thay as \"where the thicknecks dwell,\" and was viewed as a place of coarse untutored folk who were desperate enough to be readily hired as grunt labor. The city was\u2014and still is\u2014a base for prospectors and miners seeking to find gems and metal ores in the mountains, and for hunters and adventurers exploring the hills and heights and the wilderlands beyond. The mountains remain untamed and teeming with game, with more than a few prowling monsters as well.",
								"Several large veins of gems and precious ores have been discovered here recently, and it is home to numerous fortified, always-busy smelters in the foothills to the east of the city. The Red Wizards take great interest in the smelters and their operations and maintain a close watch over them. Local merchants have to claw and grasp and scramble to make their fortunes and learn very early on to keep their mouths shut and leave politics to those that active play in those cloakand- dagger games. Laborers learn that if they want to eat regularly, let alone live in any sort of comfort and dignity, they have to go elsewhere and forge lives away from this harsh backwater.",
								"Some interesting sites in this tharch are Redfist Tower and Laumauntor's in the city, and the abandoned, reportedly haunted smelter of Hurrkeep, in the foothills a day northeast of the city.",
								"Redfist Tower is the main soldiers' barracks and the abode of the autarch of Pyarados. Its name comes from the red stone it is built from, which was long ago fused together through enchantment and artifice so as to have a hard, glass-like nigh-unbreakable outer shell, and from its shape: the squat tower bulges at the top into two wider floors that house the autarch and his household, combined together, these elements look like a fist atop an upthrust arm when viewed from some angles. It's pierced by the Red Gate, the largest gate in the inner city wall, that carries a wide avenue named Rauntar's Way straight east to an outer city gate. Unlike the muddy and hole filled lanes in the rest of the Shield, Rauntar's Way is a carefully paved and well-maintained street. City soldiers forcibly keep the Way clear of vendor wagons and squatters so there is always a clear and ostensibly secure swift route through the Shield. Redfist Tower has a dungeon beneath it, and local tales insist strange monsters are locked up in it, not just miscreants. Legend insists that treasure is hidden within the halls and walls of Redfist Tower, put there by autarchs who ran afoul of the wrong Red Wizard and ended up too swiftly dead to ever retrieve it.",
								"Laumauntor's (\"Law-MON-tor's\") is a rambling, dimly-lit, dirty labyrinth of a tavern in a dark corner of the Shield, a place where the ceiling sags in many places and gets \"fixed\" by hammering a log into place as a temporary prop that becomes as permanent as anything in the place. Some call it \"the Muttering House\" due to the ever-present, droning sound of a myriad of quiet conversations that take place here at all hours. Laumauntor's never closes, so it serves as a home for the homeless and as hiring-fair for adventurers or anyone willing to do shady work. Everyone in the Shield knows where Laumauntor's stands but few know that Laumauntor became a lich long ago; the wizard stays in hiding, sending out floating apparitions of himself to talk to clientele or more often just spy on them from the darkest shadows.",
								"Hurrkeep takes the form of a now-roofless, half-collapsed stone castle tower with attached rampart that once enclosed ingot sheds (roofs over the in-ground dirt molds the smelted metal was poured into, to form wagon-sized ingots whose weight and bulk cut down on casual theft) that have long since utterly collapsed. Hurrkeep still has cellars beneath it, where the actual smelting was done, but it was abandoned during the raging height of the Spellplague when lurking monsters of the Underdark broke up into the cellars from below\u2014and the resident Red Wizards were too crazed or mind-melted from the blue fire to effectively fight them. Those who didn't flee fast enough perished horribly, and the denizens of the Realms Below took over Hurrkeep. Later, when Red Wizards sought to retake the place, no trace of them could be found, but the monsters attacked without warning whenever the smelter's workers were weakest, slaughtering them time and again, until the remaining Red Wizards refused to work at Hurrkeep and it was abandoned for good in favor of larger and safer smelters elsewhere in the tharch. These days, outlander adventurers are the most common visitors, and fresh rumors of treasure hidden in Hurrkeep attract more hopeful challengers whenever the supply of edible opportunists dwindles. It's doubtful any of them are true beyond a few coins and enchanted rings scattered as bait, but adventurers are too often optimists to stop coming.",

								"This tharch, a strip of poor-soil hill country between the northern edge of the Plateau and Lake Mulsantir, has always been Thay's military \"wall of ready spells and swords\" against its longtime foe, Rashemen. A \"heavily-patrolled waste\" was how one visiting merchant accurately described this region, and although this description is more than a few decades old, not much has changed. The frequent patrols find their base in the remains the fortified city of Surthay itself, a walled settlement that grew around the original castle of Surthay.",
								"This muddy city was a home for fisherfolk supplying the kitchens of the castle with fresh lake food. Surthay has always been squalid and reeking of decay; a sand-bar jutting east to enclose and shelter an arm of the lake forms an excellent natural harbor for small craft but no currents or other water movements scour out this backwater except during the most violent storms, so it stinks of all the dying plants and fish that rot in it. Aside from these fishing boats, no Thayan vessels ply Lake Mulsantir so Surthay has never had any sort of real port facilities. There are many mud flats where fishing boats can be careened and moored against rising tides, rising to bare rock outcrops where nets are spread to dry and for repair; a visitor may look in vain for wharves and warehouses. Still, the creatures in the mud flats and the lake, from large crabs to eels to curiously shiny small fish, are all quite delicious and require only minimum seasoning or treatment prior to consumption.",
								"The city of Surthay today consists of three very different parts: \"Westsulkh,\" a dirty, crime-ridden shantytown that's home to fisherfolk, poor Thayans who've fetched up here because they could find no better place to live in the rest of Thay, and a few outlanders who fled from justice or feuds or debts elsewhere; the frowning, mighty, many-towered fortress of Surtowers rising like the brutal stone prow of a huge ship in the center, pointed north at Rashemen and bristling with catapults, trebuchets, and ballistae; and \"True Surthay\" to the east, a district title self-bestowed by local Mulan nobles who dwell in a luxurious maze of walled mansions and the two-comfortable-coach-width lanes that curve between them. Among the nobles dwell the local Red Wizards of Surthay, with many of them being skilled abjurers.",
								"Dung- and refuse-heaped mud flats separate Westsulkh from the mouth of the River Thay, which has its ship jetties to the south, well inland to keep them out of easy reach of raiders from Rashemen. Walls and patrols keep the Westar from those jetties, and their slum from expanding to engulf them. The river separates Westsulkh from the real reek\u2014and very real perils\u2014of the vast, trackless swamp of Surmarsh.",
								"This sinister wetland has always been a maze of bogs that can swallow and drown entire teams of horses and oxen, and clumps of ground dry enough to support trees that the swamp cannot drown, so a canopy of tree leaves and hanging vines shrouds much of the swamp in permanent gloom; the trees and grasses that are often as tall and thick as stands of bamboo provide ample cover for even large and fierce swamp inhabitants like black dragons, lizardfolk, {@creature otyugh|MM|otyughs}, {@creature roper|MM|ropers}, and a coven of {@creature Green Hag|MM|green hags}. It's said in Westsulkh that the {@creature Green Hag|MM|green hags} invite and control a succession of black dragons to lair in the Surmarsh, maneuvering the wyrms into confronting and fighting formidable intruders. Nonetheless, the swamp has always been a magnet for Thayans\u2014nobles, and wealthy, successful merchants who like to behave like nobles\u2014who love to hunt and bring back monster trophies. It is said in Westsulkh that the hags keep score, desiring to take a greater toll of hunters than the hunters take of their \"beloved beasties.\"",
								"As the tharchioness must pay for food supplies sent to her tharch, Surthay is often a hungry city; the wealthy and powerful know to maintain their own larder-cellars, and the soldiery often eat the castle stores and the shelves of all food shops bare, leaving the poor of Westsulkh to fend for themselves, from what the fishing-boats bring and what can be gleaned wild from the fringes of the Surmarsh and from the bleak hills of the rest of Surthay. The sandbar and mud flats do yield clams to those who don't mind getting really filthy and risking potential death by drowning while digging for them.",
								"Locals soon grow used to the ever-present stench of the Surmarsh and lose most nuances of their sense of smell. Although the Red Wizards work minor weather magics to divert the breezes north out over the lake, disease-carrying stinging insects plague the city. Thunderstorms often rage in spring and fall, humidity makes the city nigh-unbearable in high summer, and winters are both damp and cold.",
								"By pitting the poor and the fisherfolk against each other in feuds her spies and covert agents promote, the tharchioness keeps crime in the city personal and low-level rather than the more complex intrigues that plague the other tharches. Still, torture and casual murder is far less common than it once was as the tharchioness tends to personally kill any who dare to commit these acts in her tharch, so most crime is of the \"snatch goods and beat those who object\" variety.",
								"Surthay is a frontier backwater that the rest of Thay ignores as much as possible; it's sometimes said to be \"a good place to exile someone to.\" It doesn't produce enough food to feed itself, let alone ship anything to rest of Thay; what little it does export (often stolen Thayan goods to Thesk) is usually traded for more and better food than can be gleaned or grown locally.",
								"Aside from the notorious Surmarsh, sites of interest in this tharch include the Lost Spires and Duskur's Cave.",
								"The Lost Spires are the ruins of more than a dozen overgrown, long-abandoned mansions overlooking the mouth of the River Gauros, in easternmost Surthay. These monster-infested, once-grand complexes were built by Red Wizards who eventually grew tired of defending and rebuilding them against brigand raids, Rashemi invasions, and the occasional hunting black dragon from the Surmarsh. They can readily be found from afar thanks to the few slender, spire-topped towers among them that haven't collapsed and fallen yet. These have their lingering tales of hidden treasure stolen from Thayan nobles and magic snatched from Red Wizards. What is known is that certain Red Wizards from time to time use their spells to transport themselves for covert face-to-face negotiating meetings in the upper rooms of these towers where none will overhear. These spur fresh rumors that they leave cryptic messages and valuables in those lofty chambers for others to retrieve.",
								"Duskur's Cave is one of many narrow clefts in the north face of the Plateau and faces Lake Mulsantir. Most of these are dead ends that serve as temporary lairs for brigands or for trolls, {@creature leucrotta|MPMM}, and other opportunistic monsters, but one of them\u2014and Surthan can never agree on just which one\u2014has a small, unassuming-looking side-crevice that makes a few sharp turns and then descends into the upper reaches of the Underdark. Duskur was a Thayan merchant whose head was eaten by one such monster, but in Surthay there are frequent rumors of local merchants who've retained their heads thus far and have dared to establish regular trade expeditions with denizens of the Underdark.",

								"The highest-elevation tharch in the realm, Thaymount consists of the Ruthammar Plateau and a range of volcanic mountains that rise up from it; collectively, they are referred to as \"the Thaymount\" or \"High Thay\" when speaking of the entire, larger region.",
								"In the past, much of this area served as the homes and training-grounds of Thayan legions; reinforcements were drawn from them whenever needed for Thay's many wars. Other than that, the tharch was largely wilderland, save for a few army-guarded gold mines along the southern edge of the plateau. However, this region was rapidly transformed after Szass Tam chose to dwell and rule from here. Szass Tam's presence meant that the zulkirs of the realm soon maintained residences in Thaymount and spent most of their time there. So too did the most ambitious and powerful Red Wizards beneath the zulkirs, for fear of being sidelined, demoted, or simply ignored. This in turn attracted lesser Red Wizards, noble families, and even the wealthiest priests of Thay, all of whom established estates in High Thay, transforming the barren foothills of the mountains into terraced gardens around palatial mansions.",
								"From the lower reaches of this heart of luxury and spreading out over the plateau is an ever-growing patchwork of more extensive estates. For those not active in the daily governance of the realm, abodes in this tharch tend to serve as refuges from city residences, especially in the hottest months of each year. Most Thayans prefer to be city-dwellers, and return from their luxurious Thaymount villas and surrounding manicured estates to the bustle and crowding of their favorite cities whenever they can.",
								"With the coming of the mighty to this tharch came security; soldiers patrol the heights along the edge of the plateau often. All outlanders and most Thayan slaves and commoners are forbidden to enter this tharch unless accompanied and watched over by a Red Wizard, and even Red Wizards seldom visit this tharch unless summoned or on specific missions. An outlander traveling alone who doesn't look like someone's bodyguard on an urgent errand, or any group of armed outlanders on the move, is going to attract attention in Thaymount\u2014and can expect to be challenged sooner rather than later.",
								"Some of the surrounding volcanoes are still active and gift the region with frequent earth tremors, smoke plumes of various sizes, and the occasional sulphurous stinking wind, though full eruptions are rarities. The entire region is arid and barren due to ashfalls but outside of this immediate space, Thaymount consists of verdant grasslands, dotted here and there with pine forests that were once far more extensive.",
								"There are a few towns and a handful of small, nameless settlements here and there across High Thay, where commoners dwell and farm to supply the estates of the nobles and Red Wizards, but no cities. The mighty of Thay haven't yet expanded their holdings into the northeastern part of the tharch which remains wild. This Wild High is roamed by gnolls, orcs, and a few goblins; these beings forage, farm, and hunt, keeping well away from the humans\u2014for to be noticed is to be captured and forced into service in the armies of Thay, gaining regular food but losing all freedom, and enduring harsh and constant discipline.",
								"All around Thaymount, the rising flanks of the plateau are honeycombed with now-abandoned caverns and passage networks that once housed Thay's armies. The soldiers now dwell in similar tunneled accommodations in the sides of the Thaymount range itself. Gnolls, darkenbeasts, and captured monsters inhabit caverns on the north and northwest flanks of the mountains, where humans are few. Highly trained, well-equipped orc and orog soldiers of the foremost legions among Thay's armies dwell in passages and caverns on the south and southeast sides of the mountains, ready at hand to defend and be commanded by the zulkirs and Red Wizards, not to mention the High Regent.",
								"Weather throughout this tharch is strictly controlled by weather spells worked by the Red Wizards; they keep everything well-watered, but restrict almost all rainfall to nighttime, to discourage illicit activities and to keep the daylit hours dry for the enjoyment of, and full use by, Thay's wealthy and powerful.",
								"The rivers Eltar, Lapendrar, and Umber all descend from the soot-covered glaciers of the Thaymount peaks, and deep volcanic rifts serve as forges; the smiths dwell where they work, in chambers flanked by the barracks of soldiers assigned to watch over them for any hint of treachery. Red Wizard spells whisk air to the \"hammering floors,\" and carry harmful gases away to vent into the skies above the peaks. These mountains also hold spellcasting chambers for Red Wizards to practice and experiment in and the private fortresses of certain zulkirs; lesser Red Wizards have been banished from the mountains and forced to build their towers on the grassy plains of High Thay.",
								"Szass Tam rules from the Citadel, located within one of the highest peaks of Thaymount, slightly south of the midpoint of the range. It long ago expanded into worked-out gold mines immediately south of it, in the mountains; the mines worked today are along the southern edge of High Thay.",
								"The Citadel is an ancient stronghold of tunnels and subterranean chambers, encircling the caldera of an extinct volcano. These subterranean spaces have been much enlarged by Szass Tam\u2014sometimes unintentionally, when spells he was experimenting with in deep caverns went awry, blowing apart huge areas of bedrock. The Citadel is now Szass Tam's \"ruling castle\" even though it lacks towers and magnificent chambers of state, and its defenses are almost entirely the undead that crowd it. Red Wizards attending him here are well aware that powerful, foe-smiting \"hanging spells\" cast long ago lurk everywhere; Szass can trigger any of them in an instant, even when his attention seems to be elsewhere.",
								"Passages descend from the deepest halls of the Citadel in two directions: north under the mountain range to the Doomvault, and south to a gigantic cavern that thrums with crackling blue fire, and houses a floating rock of immense size that is rumored to be larger than many fortresses.",
								"This floating rock is the greatest secret of Thay: the Athora, a rock that also happens to be a mighty node of magic, a source of magical energies so strong and restless that it has made the mountain, and much of the plateau around it, radiate strong magic. Its presence makes sentient creatures born and living in this tharch for long periods have an increased aptitude for the Art, or even spontaneously exhibit innate magical talents. The Athora continues to make Thay a source of wizards, a land of magic to rival Halruaa. It's said the stone is a sacred thing whose purpose is known exclusively to the goddess {@deity Mystra|Faerûnian|SCAG} and Szass Tam, and that he often visits it, to stand fascinated or to \"renew himself\" when weak or damaged or uncertain, but dares do no more for reasons known only to himself.",
								"The Doomvault is the creation of the now-dead Red Wizard Kazit Gul, whose fascination and life-work was to explore and study the most famous and deadly dungeons of Faerûn. Eventually he began constructing his own vast labyrinth beneath Thaymount, and made himself a lich in order to finish his work. He constructed features of the Doomvault, and applied enchantments to it, to lure adventurers so he could devour their souls to empower his phylactery. Today, the Doomvault remains a dangerous, trap-filled labyrinth defended by Red Wizards, golems who obey them, resident undead, and various bound and unleashed monsters. Certain Red Wizards in every military fortress across Thay know spells that can teleport hostile intruders\u2014such as adventurers\u2014into the Doomvault.",
								"Today, Thay's economy is underpinned by the vast amounts of gold coming out of a huge deposit, the Fist of Gold, underlying the central southern edge of High Thay, just north of the lip of the Second Escarpment. Guarded not just by soldiers and undead, and mined by tireless undead with only a handful of Red Wizard overseers, the gold mines are covered by seven low, squat fortresses, each concealing the headframe of a shaft sloping down into the Fist. The crushing and smelting are done inside these strongholds, and massive conical gold ingots the size of an adult human are shipped out of the mines through tunnels under Red Wizard guard. Slag and rubble are simply tipped over the edge of the Escarpment to rain down onto an ever-heightening pile below in Lapendrar. Caverns in the Citadel contain more smelted gold than humans have seen across all the rest of Faerûn, as Szass Tam releases only what is needed to keep Thay well-to-do, not wanting gold to become too abundant and so lose its value.",

He devotes his days to his work which consists of overseeing the gold mines, keeping track of all intrusions into the tharch from outside, and keeping discipline among the troops, Red Wizards, and clerks and scribes of Thay's government; he does this so well that even the most veteran orcs fear him, and theft, corruption, and violence are all kept to a minimum because \"Myrant the Tyrant sees all and punishes more.\" Eldroun enjoys inflicting pain, often with a metal-spiked whip, which he tests on himself, publicly, before lashing a miscreant.",

								"The southernmost tharch of Thay, Thazalhar is essentially a border defense region. It is hilly countryside, patrolled by mounted soldiers as commanded by Yaelend Hulthroun, the tharchion. It has no cities and no named settlements on maps, and its population consists of a handful of roving shepherds and their flocks, a larger handful of innkeepers and horse- and oxen-traders located in individual steadings along the trade roads. There are secret forts in abundance (earthen rings with dugout barracks and stables, and adjacent lookout hills topped by signal beacons), scattered throughout the region.",
								"The land is verdant and with almost no local population to regularly forage it teems with game. The land is filled with berries of all types, and nearly all the flora is safely edible. Birds are plentiful and the children in the inns and hill-forts are sent out daily with baskets of stones to fling and bring down enough fowl for stewpots. Traplines around most inn properties, and fishing in local streams (of which there are many; the land is very well watered) can readily feed inhabitants, and even wayfarers can feed themselves easily.",
								"Due to its devastation in the Battle of Thazalhar when the demon Eltab was summoned, most of Thay believes this tharch is haunted; after the fighting was done, this tharch was described as \"one vast graveyard.\" Many Thayan tales tell of \"armies of the restless dead\" rising out of the soil to march by night, overwhelming isolated homes and even inns, and terrorizing the living who do manage to flee. Heroic travelers claim the truth is different: most see the occasional ghoul or skeleton or three, and not much more.",
								"To keep Mulhorand from invading, or any master among the many caravans carrying the exports of Thay south, or imports north, from getting the idea that invading Thay is merely a matter of butchering a few mounted troops with lances and crossbows, Red Wizards regularly send their apprentices unannounced to Thazalhar to spell-hunt monsters, with instructions to \"impress everyone but soldiers of Thay, and spare no brigands or horse-thieves.\" Which means that spells can be hurled without warning in this \"empty\" land, especially off the trade-roads. This has the added benefit of also keeping control of what many Thayans refer to as \"the Monster Prowl,\" an event that sees creatures from the mountains descend upon the lowlands in winter and spring in search of food when their regular prey grows scarce.",
								"There is a persistent rumor in Thay that Szass Tam intends to make the graveyard battlefield of this tharch \"erupt\" with masses of undead, someday soon, and invade Mulhorand with them, \"sweeping the living before them, or slaughtering them all.\" No evidence has been discovered to support this, so this rumor carries little weight.",

										"Just as Yaelend's position as a ruling sorcerer (when so many of his erstwhile peers are wizards) is a deviation from the Thayan norm, so too is the pay that he receives from Szass Tam's personal coffers: regular deliveries of easily portable and useful magic items. Hulthroun treasures these baubles and trinkets and keeps them hidden as much as possible. He is a diligent steward of the tharch which he firmly believes is \"Thay's tomorrow\" and that it will one day grow to expand and annex Mulhorand.",

He's dedicated to defending his corner of Thay and is keenly aware of wayfarers who enter the region, but he doesn't look down on Mulhorandi or any other sort of outlander. In fact, he treats mighty Red Wizards and dirt-poor laborers alike: as equals. He is, however, desperately lonely, and dreams of someday finding a suitable mate who will ride at his side, the long-haired companion of his dreams.",

								"To all Thayans who aren't zulkirs, nobles, or powerful Red Wizards, this tharch is the heart, backbone, and \"big belly\" of Thay. Tyraturos annually produces many vegetable crops and copious amounts of fruit in its southern reaches, and is especially known for grain crops that are made into bread, ale, and stronger fiery drinks like bazaedur. Bazaedur is a sweet, jet-black syrupy vintage, beloved by many Thayans but is an acquired taste for most drinkers from other lands.",
								"Wagons creak and groan through this tharch day and night, and its toll booths\u2014as its tax stations are known\u2014are populated day and night. An empty wagon may pass for free, but a laden one must pay one silver piece, which they sometimes do with a practiced throw of that coin. Thanks to these regular tolls and the bountiful crops, Tyraturos is quite prosperous, and its current tharchioness makes sure that wealth reaches even the lowliest of residents.",
								"Tyraturans are generally contented citizens, who live in a peaceful, orderly, fairly-governed tharch where adventures and bad things happen elsewhere, the roads and even the back orchards are safe by night, and the surveillance of Red Wizards and less obvious spies is happily accepted as the price of such safety.",
								"This is the tharch where one can buy anything, or find skilled crafters who\u2014for a price, and when they can finally get to your order among all their high-piled orders\u2014will make something to your own custom design. Skilled glassblowers, masons, dyers, and weavers can be found in abundance, and their workshops are busy for as much of a day and night as they desire them to be. Thay's economy is bustling and Tyraturos is its engine that makes things, all manner of things, as well as feeding the realm and preparing most of Thay's exports.",
								"The city of Tyraturos was once notorious as a filthy, unpleasant place, but under its last three autarchs and the current tharchioness and her predecessor, sewers have been constructed, roads re-laid, and many buildings razed and replaced. Moreover, a highly trained and professional city watch has been founded and trained; they are paid well and most strive to become ever-better at their jobs and feel little urge to succumb to bribery and corruption as the rest of the world might know it. The city remains Thay's third-largest and is no longer one of its most detested.",
								"The current tharchioness has worked hard to craft a \"social round\" of regular revels and street music performances and plays put on at newly-constructed theaters for the city. She and her team even work to organize trips from elsewhere in the tharch to stay at set-price inns and \"take in a play and shop for a day,\" to the great delight of those Thayans that find themselves gifted with the opportunity.",
								"The city of Tyraturos is the best place to seek moneylenders or investors in Thay. Coin is abundant and competition is fierce, and unlike so many other cities and tharches, commerce is not controlled by a few noble and wealthy merchant families who make covert behind-curtain deals to cut down on competition and raise fees and prices. Corruption is the foe of the current autarch, Laheirauna Mraedros (human female fighter and sorcerer; chaotic neutral; flamehaired, curious, and swift to laughter), and in this she is fully backed by her longtime friend and lover the tharchioness.",
								"Formerly, Tyraturos was a political battleground between feuding nobles, cabals of merchants backed by a Zulkir, an ambitious Red Wizard, or one of the old and wealthy local non-noble families like the Kaunturs, the Naravens, the Paladreths, or the Yavaunds, but Szass Tam not-so-subtly let it be known that the rebuilding city would no longer welcome such infighting, and they were to relocate their disputes to elsewhere in Thay and treat this city as neutral ground\u2014or else. It only took about a dozen unpleasant public demises before his message was accepted, and the new social whirl captured the support of most of the local antagonists; those who couldn't or wouldn't bend withdrew from social life in the city, and everyone else tried to be nice to each other and soon\u2014on the surface, at least\u2014succeeded. Now, the \"Peace of Tyraturos\" is something most citizens, high and low, prize and fight to maintain. And as a result, trade and commerce has soared, fortunes are being made, taxes are being paid almost joyfully, and \"all banners are rising.\"",

										"The City of a Thousand Temples remains the center of holiness in Thay for commoners and tourists, which is to say it's not where upperpriests fight behind closed doors for supremacy and temple policy is decided (that would be Eltabbar), but it's where one goes to buy prayers and statuettes and holy water and devotional jewelry in bulk; the mercantile heart of Thayan religion.",
										"Many of the largest, showiest temples stand along the High Holy Way, which is a long, broad, gently-curving (northwest to east and around to southwest again) street paved with whitestone cobbles. I'm no expert on cobbles, but they crack and crumble faster than the usual darker ones, so repair crews are almost always to be seen fussing with the paving somewhere along it.",
										"The other major streets in town, from north to south, are Tasharaka's Way, Lorlurduin Lane, and Shavrath Street, all of which cross over the High Holy Way, all three bending from northwest-southeast to due east after they do so. Shavrath is where you'll find all the small, interesting shops \"everyone\" flocks to, particularly east of the High Holy Way, and Lorlurduin's eastern end hosts most of the noisiest, dirtiest foundries, smithies, and weaveries. Tasharaka's is more residential, lined with the walled grand homes of wealthy local citizens\u2014and where you'll always find a few expensive mansions for rent.",
										"Bezantur is one of the few cities in Thay to welcome and cater to outlanders, rather than tolerating and ignoring them. This can be seen in the friendly attitudes of its shopkeepers and in a tangible way: arkuls. Arkuls are purple banners on poles that have oil lanterns perched atop them that illuminate the banners in dark times, usually located in streetmoots. The banners display a circle of holy symbols to many of the tolerated major gods, and have a local courtier standing under them, who's there to provide bewildered visitors with directions. Almost all of these pleasant folk\u2014and they are, I'll give them that\u2014supplement their poor pay by accepting inducements (bribes, but we Thayans {@i hate} that word; always call them \"inducements\") to recommend specific inns, taverns, jewelers, stables, and local businesses.",
										"I'm not so easily bought, but the local shops that most impress me begin with Bethandor's Rugs, Tapestries, and Blankets (on Shavrath, of course)\u2014top quality and understated designs that please the eye, not shouting one's gaze into submission, and Bethandor stocks some very large pieces, where other places must custom-order, so you wait. A place not to be missed is Taltyn's, a gnome-run shop that carries small, metal household gadgets like coffers that hide daggers in their outer surfaces, and wheel-striker tinder boxes for lamplighting, and swivel-trios of hand magnifying glasses, and rooms of similar stuff. I always buy some of their tiny pliers with the chain-cutting blades built in at the joint, and a fold-down clip for holding a torch or wick or candle so one can see what one's manipulating. I'm told Bezantur is home to some good pet shops that run to large serpents and even larger hunting cats (lions and tigers), but I've never been\u2014pets are expensive, and I travel so much I'd almost be forced to neglect them.",
										"I always stay at the block-long, redstone Haelhontorh ond (old, haughty, and pricey but worth it), but other good inns include Sussavrel's House, Yaraetowers, and Miklarra's Moondoor (very popular with young ladies who like posing in the jaws of danger, being seen with other young ladies, and hiring entertainments of questionable taste\u2014but it has two much quieter rear wings for everyone else, who just want decent service and privacy and a good suite of rooms in which to sleep). At the south end of the city are many small inns that are little better than oversized family homes, varying widely in quality depending on the family, but I'm told some of them are astonishingly affordable, and sometimes give discounts in return for service (a guest helping re-tile a roof, or reset a downspout or recaulk a rain-barrel). Some names I've heard are Thrammon's, Belhrin's, Kauntlann's, and Thul Habbadar's. (There are a lot of folk surnamed \"Thul Habbadar\" in Bezantur; it must be one of those endless-cousins families\u2014and it's always pronounced \"THOOL Habbah-dar.\")",
										"As for eating in Bezantur, if you have coin to toss wildly, no more expensive a good meal can be found than at Arzarael's Bower\u2014slow service and everything is wildly showy, six or seven wait-staff for every dish that's brought, but the sauces and side-dishes are to die for, and they roast whole beasts with care and six different marinades and oils. I find that Arzarael's is for impressing naïve clients, once, and the rest of the time I'd rather eat with less fanfare and purse-gouging, at such establishments as Dazzakhar's and Touzoon's Table and even The River Eel, which has a dangerous past as the site of several fatal duels, and so fascinates the young who flock there\u2014but if they have any sense or tastebuds, stay for the superb cooking.",
										"And if you want to be seen to kneel to {@deity Bane|Faerûnian|SCAG} in the best company, the temple to do it in is The House of The Black Hand, newest and most tasteless of the blackstone temples along the High Holy Way (if you find judging tastelessness difficult, it's on the west side of the street, at the north end).",

										"The first city of Thay spends far too much time shoutingly reminding you of its status, I find, in part with a lot of heavy-handed \"don't park thy wagon HERE\" rules and in part by overpricing everything egregiously, but it does host some of the most impressive architecture in the land. It's also a city where every hand-patch of ground is paved in cobbles; outside the walls of the compounds of the rich (a few of whom have gardens, but not many) there's not a tree nor blade of grass to be seen. So the place bakes in the sun. Hence the lavish use of pumped, cascading water and unseen-cellar-mule-turned fans in the larger chambers of inns, high-class eateries, and a few civic buildings.",
										"Eltabbar is also a place swept by fads, as everyone seeks to ape the whims of the powerful, so last season everyone wore brass facemasks in public, the season before everyone waved ornate walking-sticks about as they walked, and this year it's little bobbing beholder- sculptures dangling from elbow and wrist on fine chains. And every last one of these fads leaves a residue: each time, a few folk cling to them forever-after, so most gatherings of Eltabbrans look like eccentrics have been let out of a dungeon, and haven't dispersed yet. Rich, well-dressed eccentrics, mind you.",
										"Eltabbar is a mix of a crossgrid of slightly-winding but generally north-south and east-west minor streets, cut through by wider radial streets, radiating out from central civic buildings (most of them hollow squares around courtyards), where of old Red Wizards lorded it over cringing minor bureaucrats (these days, Szass Tam thankfully keeps his wizards busy patrolling Thay's countryside and on specific missions, not nitpicking the clerical functions of taxation and government record-keeping and overseeing granary-stock rotations).",
										"The most important east-west street is Harrival's Ride, and it's twice the width of most of them and stretches almost the entire width of the city. If you need to rent a palanquin or coach, the best establishments to do so (providing the cleanest and most stylish rides) are clustered at the west end of the Ride; in typically frustating \"Elt\" fashion, most of the horse-rental stables are clear across the city at the Ride's east end.",
										"The major north-south street is in the east end, crossing all but the southern third of the city, a quarter of the way west from the eastern edge of Eltabbar. It, too, is unusually wide, and is known as Old Crypt Street because its northern end is a necropolis of stone mansions that house only the dead\u2014Thayan nobles, fallen tharchions and tharchionesses, and Red Wizards and zulkirs, all in their own personal wagon- sized sarcophagi arranged tastefully around the ornate, silent, dusty mansion chambers. Of old, this district rang to the nightly-shrieks of would-be tomb robbers being torn or hacked apart by guards and monstrous guardians, but these days Eltabbar seems to be running out of reckless idiots.",
										"The radial streets are where the best inns, taverns, clubs, and eateries are all to be found, and there's a glittering array of them, for those with coin to melt in their profligate haste. I'm not such a person, and so avoid most of them, though I have been inside Luth Murleph's Pride, a gambling club known for its debauchery for hire, extensive wine cellar, and habit of draping everything in rich deep purple draperies and tapestries, with matching carpet everywhere underfoot. It stands on Miirathoyor's Lane. Around the corner on Murbekh Street is the Kalvondrel, the club for utterly wanton revelry, but the jests about its patrons unexpectedly growing rare skin-molds wore thin many ailments ago, for we prudent folk.",
										"My favored inn is the old, dimly-lit, quiet and cozy Elvurturhond on Lyontul Street, but some swear by the haughtier and far more expensive Szeltothur's Welcome, on Rendrel's Ride. I dislike loud fountains of overly-scented water, and echoing chimes, and so avoid it and all of the folk who patronize it, who are of the gaily-laughing-at-all-hours-to-show-how-rich-andcarefree- they-are ilk I detest.",
										"Eltabbar has many local alehouses for commoners to wearily drink in, and even a few justly better known taverns like Paeral's Flying Dolphyn on Tul Street and The Iron Tankard on Lazzeyelar's Lane, but I find them all too noisy and crowded for talking trade, and so take my libations with platters of fine roast boar or cardrauth at the better eateries of the city.",
										"Again, there are haughty and overly priced establishments like Three Black Plumes on The Street of Seven Statues (where once seven zulkirs were sculpted in stone at twice life size, ere someone devised a spell that turned one of them into deadly shrapnel whenever they wanted to slaughter a hefty number of Eltabbrans , and the few remaining statues were hastily removed) and Ilkryn's Tabard on The Street of Murlanth's Sorrows, but like most working merchants, I don't dine to be seen dining. I eat to avoid passing out, and to talk trade with folk I don't mind eating with. So I prefer The Six Platters on Urtraunt Lane, Tranch's Folly on The Street of the Riven Bell (superb wine cellar, and they serve black cake to bulge for, bristling with more cherries and roast nuts than I've ever seen elsewhere), and for real privacy but far more spartan\u2014and lower-priced\u2014fare, Szult's Corner, on Tablakh Street.",
										"When it comes to shops, Eltabbar has some magnificent ones, and if you don't mind fawning shop assistants and prices thrice what they should be, you can truly buy anything in the city. Just don't expect bargains; just breathing seems to cost more in Thay's capitol city.",

										"Too often forgotten or even seen as \"lesser\" by other cities of Thay (following the lead of the Red Wizards, who disdain it along with the rest of the cities in the tharch of Lapendrar; in turn, all of these cities disdain Red Wizards whenever they can do so yet retain their skins), Escalant is one of my favorite port cities to visit and trade in, second only to Nethjet (as devices and innovations fascinate me and kindle my trading-lust).",
										"Escalantrans know how to party, and every third or fourth day, all the year round, seems to be a local festival for potters, or tavern-dancers, or those sport fisherfolk who land record-large fish, or temple-lantern-carvers, or tomb effigy figurine polishers, or {@i someone}. It's all an occasion for piping music, dancing, drinking, and standing up on tavern-tables to declaim hilariously bad poetry. If you know a hopelessly-bad bard or minstrel, this is the city for them, they'll fit right in. This is one of the few places in all Thay where folk don't look over their shoulders and keep their voices down for fear of Red Wizards or the spies of the High Regent\u2014because Tam seems to ignore it. Outlanders come and go freely, folk in little backstreet shops cast spells for fees or sell potions and scrolls that really work\u2014folk who aren't Red Wizards and fervently don't want to be\u2014and there's a thriving black market in goods \"liberated\" from civic storage warehouses and granaries, and even Thayan military barracks.",
										"Not that I would have anything to do with such shady trade or goods; I like my skin as whole as it is, and so come here only to trade with respectable Chessentan and Sembian merchants who want Thayan barley and bulk vegetables at lower prices than they can grow them for back home, and in return can sell me metals and fine textiles for less than I can buy them for via my trading-contacts all over Thay. Many merchants are of like mind, so Escalant is something of a hot trading center, and one of the few places where outlander bodyguards and mercenaries for hire can slip into Thay almost unnoticed, so there's a brisk hiring market for them, too\u2014as most Thayans see such \"foreign swords\" as the only way to surprise homegrown rivals who keep a close eye on anyone Thayan for hire.",
										"So I come here more often than I should, and always stay at The Blue Stag on Thundle Street, and drink at The Five-Headed Newt on Pryath's Lane for choice, though crowding sometimes forces me to my second choices: Hulfaer's Doors inn on Dartrumpet Way, and to drink and dine at The Blood Blazon on Bottle Lane.",
										"Carousers head for such taverns as Helver's Harpoon on Hyrdrar Street and the Beheaded Behir on Vulantern Lane. The Five-Bladed Bull used to be \"the\" wild tavern, but it burned to the ground after a wizard's duel almost a decade ago, and has never been rebuilt for fear of the Red Wizards using it as a pretext for arriving in force to clamp down on local liberties\u2014 being as none of the mages involved in the duel was even Thayan, let alone red-robed.",
										"The haughty overpayers rest their heads at The Irbrandthond inn on Beldrard Street, and dine in shining and horribly overpriced splendor at Calanna's Chance on The Way of The Wyverns (myself, I don't see the appeal of scantily clad lads and lasses dancing atop the very table you're eating from, but that's the signature entertainment at the Chance).",
										"As for major streets: there aren't any. Every street winds like a drunken snake, and is almost as important as any other street, and the maze they make up, all taken together, takes years to learn but thankfully locals are all cheerfully eager to give accurate directions to any outlander or visiting Thayan\u2014unless they're a Red Wizard, in which case the directions will almost always take the Red Wizard to a particularly smelly and rundown back-alley privy, where street urchins play pranks.",

										"The city of a thousand purple domes is walled, claustrophobic, and easy to get lost in, as just about every street looks like every other street.",
										"With two notable exceptions: the long, winding, wide street known as Tarthant's Way, where the best and the brightest in Thay's \"City of Dirty Underhanded Smugglers\" work, shop, and trade, and Setsethrar's Ride, the wagon-way that links all of the important warehouses that ring the inner walls of the city, almost all the way around it (there's a triangular break in the ring at the south end of the city, where an open market known as the Sakkandar persists as the best place for moneylending with blood bargains and no written trail in all of Thay\u2014don't break a bargain unless you want your throat slit, but otherwise taxes and official notice can readily be avoided).",
										"Not that I, not being any sort of smuggler, would know anything about that. No, as a respectable trader, I confine my activities to staying at Thisskim's House inn or The Alaphthond inn, both on Tarthant's Way, and dining and making trade deals in the rentable private dining rooms upstairs at The Emerald Cellar on Brazantur's Way, or the noisier and less private, but with a matchless wine cellar and tasty small appetizer platters galore, Hardarmored Hippocampus Club on Uthscimitar Street.",
										"Now if I was a two-fisted drinker, I'd visit the Staring Eye tavern on Nethembril Lane, with its mock giant beholder's eye overhanging street sign out front and a real, pickled eyestalk in a lit brine-tank behind the bar, and if I was a real shatter-tankard brawler, I'd go to The Mrahout's Fist on Wulyrabur Street, but I'm thankfully neither. Nor am I likely to brave the low prices but hit-and-miss meals served at that enormously popular barn of an eatery The Old Rahanna, on Premble Street\u2014where the poorer working half of Murbant fills their bellies twice daily because it's cheap and fast.",
										"Any merchant with more than half their wits knows not to visit Murbant too often, as the authorities do keep watch, and assume merchants who fetch up amid the amethyst-hued domes too often are too cozy with smugglers. Which means searches and inspections and ledger checks and inducements to be paid in all directions.",
										"So I visit seldom, and go only to my favorite few places to trade with the same few relatively respectable local merchants, and make very certain I'm publicly seen calling on {@deity Bane|Faerûnian|SCAG|Bane's} favor at The House of The Hand, on Tarthant's Way."

										"Another place where Red Wizards are hated and hampered by scrupulously polite but deceitful citizenry, who will direct them astray whenever they get the chance. Along with Thayan soldiers and civic officials of all sorts, if a Nethentan recognizes them.",
										"Unlike many other cities in Thay, Nethentans like their greenery; hanging plants festoon almost every window, and not all of them are handy-for-clipping herbs for the cook of the household. Nethentir has varied architecture, and a lively literary scene\u2014there are even entire shops here not just of books old, and books new, but of chapbooks of poetry!",
										"And all Thay knows that Nethentir is {@i the} place to come to see a play\u2014with no less than sixteen rival playhouses scattered all over the city, with the four oldest and best clustered close enough to glare at each other around the streetmoot known as The Fanfare, where the major, radial streets of Congaur's Walk, Thylen's Lane, Stornpost Street, Ulmur's Ride, and The Salumandurlar all meet. In the angles between them are all inns or playhouses, with a tavern right beside each theater (its entrance being the first door down the street it fronts on).",
										"The Fanfare is apt to be noisy even in the darkest hours of the night, though live music and horn-calls to signal the imminent beginning of a performance were both outlawed decades ago, and street loudcryers have been recently muzzled by local decree, so I stay some distance away along Stornpost, at Belvadarnra's Haven, a ladies-only inn that offers beauty baths and prohibits paid escorts, where things are luxuriously quieter.",
										"However, most visitors can't wait to take in one of the bawdy plays, where catcalling and even throwing things (squishy missiles, not daggers or lit handbombs or darts from hand crossbows!) are acceptable or even encouraged. They're usually staged at The Drunken Lion (the adjacent tavern being the notorious Floon's Fireflagon; don't pass by with impressionable innocents or children) or The Raging Raumathari (next door to Ulkur's Bench tavern, the cheapest and oldest of the popular taverns).",
										"Nethentans themselves prefer satirical farces in which Thayan nobles or Red Wizards\u2014or both\u2014get ridiculed, and there are always a trio of these running at any one time, in the evenings, with earlier-in-the-day performances of older, classic comedies (like The Wizard Was Wandering) and tragedies (like Rothzauna's Choice) at the same theaters.",
										"The cleanest and most uppercrust of the four oldest playhouses are Thaphonter's (its adjacent tavern is Pulkoon's Pleasure) and its fierce rival Dlaezur's Doors (flanked by The Dancing Duthdragon tavern, infamous for the tasteless jesters it hires to wait on tables).",
										"Many visitors to the city do all their dining either in the expensive dining lounges of the high-priced inns they stay at (such as Brenlaur's on Hazul Lane and Yulraph's on Valmalurth Street), or at the taverns that flank the playhouses around The Fanfare, but I prefer less boisterous and haughty and high-priced dining, that is also more private and suited to talking trade (as there's a steady appetite all over Thay for the fine glass lamps and vessels and ornaments the glassblowers of Nethentir produce, not to mention the superb Nethentan chairs, tables, and wood panels for walls and stair-ends; the carvers Undred and Ilmhrad Sturlast, brothers, do especially fine work). So I dine at Ungalast's Fine Cauldron on Dajent Street, or Balandur's Bowl on Evendur Way. At all costs avoid The Three-Headed Ettin dining club at the southern end of Velkroon's Street, where the food is wretched, the drinks blended and much stronger than they should be so wild drunkenness is frequent, and the brawls are often fatal. There's no truth to the rumor that the most beautiful ladies can be swept off their feet at the Ettin; those beauties are all at home busily writing claws-out anonymous pieces for the more biting Nethentan broadsheets, like Toranadur's Torch and The Happy Gallop.",

										"Where its rival Nethentir turns to books, poems, and plays, Nethjet\u2014best-known to merchants like me for its inky-watered, mildew-reeking canals, that reach fingers everywhere in a labyrinth of busy docks and warehouses\u2014looks to new ways of doing things (almost all of which Thay stubbornly pushes back against, detesting change like most large countries with centralized power) and especially new devices. \"Gadgets,\" I once heard Elminster of Shadowdale call them: small fabricated items that hold or manipulate or store things for you. Useful once you have them. Coinbelts that sort coins poured into them, and dispense them, quill boxes that eject a writing quill when you slide a button, sharpening the quill as it emerges. Self-lighting lanterns, at the flick of a wheel. That sort of thing. Even aging, conservative Red Wizards and civic officials who publicly sneer at these devices own some, and treasure them. When I'm travelling, I wear one that many merchants have adopted: a bracer on my left forearm that stores quills, parchment scraps, a trade-seal and stamp and spare wax, needles and thread, a vial of water, a dabbing-cloth, and a tinder-striker. Oh, and a tiny hidden dagger, for those defend-yourself moments. Too useful to be without, once you have one.",
										"Yet Nethjet has an even more useful side: it's where bolts, and nails and spikes, and corner-braces that timbers can be slid into to quickly make a frame, and window- frames, are all made far faster and more cheaply than elsewhere, at a \"standard\" level of quality. This is done through Jetran innovation, through use of cutting jigs and drilling forms (collectively \"fabrant\" in local parlance), and assembly lines, so relatively unskilled workers can produce corner braces, hinges, lockplates, mending plates, and the like that all have holes of the right sizes and in the right locations to function as identical replacements. This has made better housing and workplaces possible for many, not just in Thay but around the Inner Sea and in places caravans travel on to from the Fallen Stars ports. This has made the makers of Nethjet quietly rich beyond what dukes and kings elsewhere can dream of\u2014and it has made meddling authorities who seek to trammel such creativity, and tax too heavily, locally detested as the worst sort of vermin. As the Jetran saying puts it, \"Lower than cockroaches. At least I can fry and eat cockroaches without fear of the head roach sending an army to take my life for it.\"",
										"This underlying anger makes Nethjet a dangerous place for the tharchion's spies or Red Wizards or tax collectors if they wander alone, and also for misfits who damage fabrant and steal wares and create unrest among workers; such individuals all too often just \"disappear.\" And when Jetran makers and powerful traders aren't taking care of such nuisances, they're feuding with each other\u2014in long-running disputes that never really end, and are never really won. Competition with a deadly edge, one might call it.",
										"So when I come here, I watch my back. I stay at good inns in the best district (the Stride, atop the slightly-raised ridge that overlooks Lake Umber, home to the civic buildings and the temples), usually the Alameirthond on Dazarl Lane or Thelvurt's House on Tultryaun Street, and dine at nearby merchant-friendly eateries like The Crab Platter on Chanzult Street and Duthengo's Den on the Way of Taraghar, who rent out rooms for trading negotiations and can send wine and hotbites to the table-side if you order them.",
										"I avoid the taverns, where scores have a habit of being suddenly and viciously settled, but can tell you from hearsay that the most beloved are \"family locals\" like Havalar's Talltankard on Tharbanner Street and Lhaerivro's Lantern on Maskadder Lane, as well as Multraer's Hearth right out at the east end of the city on the Wayserpent Ride\u2014and the real dives where bodies pile up under the tables and not just outside the back alley doors include Barsykkur's Boots on Maersakkhan Lane and the Gelded Unicorn on Lenduth Street. In Nethjet, a tavern always serves food, but the quality as well as the breadth of the menu may vary from \"Here's our rat stew\u2014see the rats?\" to \"I'd actually order that again.\"",
										"The best shopping district for visitors and outlanders is along The Street of Lanterns in the Stride, but Jetrans go below it, to the water's edge in the Umberside district, where in the muddy alleys and maze of hovels real bargains can be had. Including, I hear, poisons and caged, live snakes, scorpions, and small monsters, for those who know who to ask.",

The Grimshield's a dangerous place even at the height of day, so my first stop (as I always approach the city from the west, along the Eastern Way) is always just inside the gates, at the Harlhond inn. Where I rent a room I'll never use, just to be able to call on their yard-guards to keep safe my wares and wagons while I go half a block down the Way to Nlathoud \"the Eye\" Draevyn to hire bodyguards (it doesn't matter if you bring your own; you need locals, or your bodyguards will just become lesser targets, after you're taken down).

From there, it's an easy walk to the much better eateries of Harl's Hothearth on Mlendil Lane, or Beldur's Boar House on Skuulmur Street. The Hothearth is suitable for trade negotiations, but the Boar House is too noisy, too crowded, and too full of spies looking to sell whatever they overhear\u2014but the food is wonderful. The Grimshield isn't the place to go looking for a wagon or closed coach or guide to hire; for the former, I go to Istyn Orlaudhvar of Istyn's Conveyances on Irburl Lane, and for the latter, I always engage Orlaudros Hlyvvyn (who assigns trusted guides depending on who you are, and where you want to go).",

										"There's also someone, somewhere in Pyarados, who breeds and feeds up snakes, because you can buy live ones by the well-ventilated cask\u2014non-venomous edible varieties like the brown rocksnake and the Thazarim false viper\u2014from several Shield traders (I always deal with Oddskull, the jovial half-orc at Oddskull's Journey on Darprentar Street).",

										"The Ang Harrad have interests in this crossroads city, so I visit more often than I otherwise might; it's dominated by granaries and wagons, oxen and way-stables, and has little else of interest. The amenities are far rougher than most of the other cities I frequent (though Umratharos isn't much better), so of the four inns\u2014one at each gate\u2014I usually stay at the Belathond nigh the south gate purely because it's slightly quieter (less traffic to and from Belizir than elsewhere) and because their beds are a trifle newer and better. Yet you may find the Torathond to the north, Zelzora's to the west, and Alavrandur's to the east little different. All of them have their own tiresome but adequate dining-lounges, and forgettable taverns stand hard by each of them, but I prefer to dine upstairs at the back of the best eatery in the city: Avalae's Prospect on Thazant Street. Try their Six Surprises Platter; the oysters are fiery, but worth it. There is one good tavern in the city that I know of, and other traders prefer alternatives to it, so you may find some. \"My\" good tavern is Alsrake's Raised Goblet on Tethlizard Lane. They provide fresh sprigs of mint to chew, to clear the breath and mouth ere stumbling \"home\" afire from strong drink.",
										"If you need a guide in town, seek Lhyzlyn Luzkund at the Goblet; a sly, flirtatious dog, but he'll not lead you wrong. If you need a remount, or fresh draft beasts, deal with Dyzcindra Mahlout of Fresh Hooves Await on Vonthurlen Lane, and if you need a new wagon or coach, or yours repaired, Svandyn Havandhar of Havandar's Wheels Turning on the Way of the Wind is your man.",
										"And if you'd be seen by the locally high and mighty being devout before {@deity Bane|Faerûnian|SCAG}, seek The Towers of the Tyrant, on Vauntreth Street. Follow your nose; it's next to a slaughterhouse."

Occasionally, however, it's necessary to meet with some of the nobles in \"True Surthay\" to have agreements signed (or more often, to hear their self-serving excuses for their failure to perform their end of a deal), and on such occasions I stay at one of the few tolerable inns the city offers: the Aemathond on Gauros Way, just inside the city gate. Hard by it stands an acceptable eatery and a superb club (one must purchase a year's membership but it's well worth it for the amenities), and I seldom stray far from this tiny slice of Surthay except to depart again, as fast as I can.",
										"The eatery is The Plenty of Mulsantir, which despite its name serves thankfully few eel and fish dishes (I quite like the soft-shelled crabs, though it's better never to think about what they may have dined on), and the club is Tshamaura's (pronounced \"Tuh-SHAHmore- ahs\" and not \"Tash-uh-more-uhs,\" unless you want to be thought a truly uncultured outlander). They do delightful iced drinks in the hot season, and sugar confections I could get very used to, year-round.",
										"There's also a tavern within sight, Duthdance's Flagon on Dlool Street, but unless you want to see drunken nobles behaving badly, what's the point? (Don't think you can take advantage of their state to mistreat them; their bodyguards all sit there, bored and disapproving, waiting to drag their sodden employers safely home.)",
										"If you need a guide to anywhere in True Surthay, ask at the other tolerable inn nigh the gate, The Pride of Surthay, for Hlantur Ozurlur, and they'll send for him. Pricey but a delightful companion, considerate, and knows everyone \"of the True.\"",
										"Should your whim or needs take you to Westsulkh, go well armed and in a large party, and either hire a closed coach from Bazhandur Omlarent (Omlarent Travels on the Foregate), or ask at the bar of the Flagon for Onstur Vorluth, and expect to pay him very well for disguises and guidance that your life may well depend upon, so treat him well and try to befriend.",
										"And should you want to be noticed by local nobles and civic officials of influence and power, your temple is The Black Lord's Door, on The Way of the Wizard (a street used by Red Wizards, so one of them long ago cast a spell that shields it from driving rain, while the rest of the city gets drenched)."

So it's something of a way-stop, but at the same time offers more luxuries at even modest establishments then can be found for far higher prices at cities elsewhere in Thay.",
										"So you can't go wrong at any of the three inns. I prefer Helra's Harathond on Qulshrine Street, but you may like Taumalaer's on Waybanners Way, or the Paerathond on Immul Street, better. All have their own dining lounges that serve perfectly good fare, but unless the weather is bad, why not go to one of the five splendid eateries that line Waybanners? All have large carved \"full platter\" jutting-out-into-the-street signs, so even dullards can spot them.",
										"If you want to talk trade privately, The Soaring Wyvern has the best back rooms and the best wine cellar, too, but if you want to be seen by the most people and don't care if you dine in a happy din, The Rozaerl is your place. The Morkalyn is the most pricey and attracts patrons hunting for each other's caresses more than the other places, The Hunting Horn is the cheapest and most comfortable family place, and that leaves Skorel's Soond as not too much of anything, a balance of all. As I said, you can't go wrong.",
										"Where you can find disappointment is in the search for a good tavern, as it seems the High Regent tired of one too many brawls among drunken servants throwing off their cloaks of tension, and closed them all. You can get drinks at any of the places I've mentioned, but all of them expect you to order something to chew and park it like a wagon on the table between you. So do that.",
										"Should you need to rent or purchase a coach, or matching draft beasts to make a suitable impression, seek out Ulvur Gokont or any of his daughters at Gokont's on Waybanners Way.",

										"Yet this walled port city is pleasant enough, and feels almost in another world from haughty Eltabbar or squalid Surthay or all the places in Thay where the Red Wizards watch you disapprovingly. They have Red Wizards here, to be sure, but only a handful, and they seem so contented in their debauchery as to not much care what anyone else gets up to. Citizens here feel this isolation, and are mostly thankful for it, and have little interest in traveling to see more of Thay.",
										"And who can blame them? Thasselen is a place of wide streets that never seem crowded, and statues. Statues everywhere, lining the streets: humans thrice life sized and up on plinths, forgotten local officials staring heroically off into the sky as they proudly hold up tax-rolls or ledgers that presumably paid for the statues.",
										"Sculpting statues, and statuettes to be sold as table adornments elsewhere, is one of the big industries in Thasselen. Which at least beats goat-herding and making goat cheeses, their other big thing.",
										"I like the city, but fear I'd grow utterly bored very quickly if I was ever forced to live here and not just make brief, hastening visits.",
										"Though it is a busy port, offering the most traffic to and from the Alaor, it has surprisingly few inns, eateries\u2014Thasselens seem to prefer to dine at home, or at the homes of close friends\u2014or taverns. Yet those they do have are clean, spacious, seem new or newly refurbished, and superior to the Thayan norm.",
										"For places to stay, I recommend Hathkongh's Haven on Maerence Street or the Zarundthond on Muranthur's Ride (which has a tallhedge garden full of orange, lime, and pear trees for guests to relax in!). For eateries, try Belabront's Haunch on Kalandavur Street (despite the name, the menu is almost all seafood) or Boy Riding Goat on Eltorlabbar Street (goat, goat, and more goat, but they do prepare it in some very succulent ways).",
										"As for taverns, I've only been to Borel's Flagon on Deldusk Lane, but have heard good things about Ammanastra's Smile on Maerence Street (don't expect to see Ammanastra or her smile; it seems she died about a century ago).",
										"And as for clubs: there aren't any. Or rather, there are private clubs where they presumably get up to all manner of wild revelry, but nothing that strangers and visitors can so much as find, let alone be welcomed at.",
										"If you need a guide to the city, ask at the Flagon for Ilkus Bhandras (moustache, catlike knowing smile, preens a lot) and he'll appear soon enough. Debonair but kindly.",
										"If it's mounts you need, or draft beasts, see Skultur Hrezzend of Hrezzend's Fine Animals on Muranthur's Ride. And if it's a wagon or coach, or repairs to either, you want, seek out Azalyn Uldryth on Delnym Lane.",
										"To pray to {@deity Bane|Faerûnian|SCAG} and be seen doing it by the locally prominent and important, go to Blackbanners House, on The March of the Dead (which, yes, leads out of town to a huge garden-like, carefully-maintained cemetery of winding paths and small stone crypt-houses; a surprising number of locals use it for open-air covert \"walking meetings\").",

I'd not eat at the place, but if your taste runs to huge roast oxen and boar cooked to blackened and then drowned in fiery red sauces, you'll be happy enough with its dining-lounge.",
										"Better eateries are The Happy Horned Dragon on Nlouvryn Lane (a noisy, bring-the-family barn of multiple levels and inner balconies; beware youths throwing food from on high), Mulsymm's Bower on Haeltront Street (haughty and pricey but hushed and superb food), and The Bull And Blade on Surtarpryn Street (best for merchants, as it's all alcoves and gently-harping strolling minstrels who never sing, so one can talk trade without nearby tables listening in).",
										"Taverns in this city are of two sorts: filling stations where exhausted workers and shopkeepers crowd at benches to get drunk as fast as possible before stumbling home to snore, and loud, raucous revel- houses where folk come to laugh, brawl, tryst, and make wagers. Your cautious, respectable merchant visits neither.",
										"If you must, I'm told that of the second, noisier sort of tavern, a place called The Stag Skull Laughs on Rendrel Street isn't too bad. If you don't mind being deafened, or having someone else's drink hurled over you.",
										"Luckily for me, Tyraturos offers a club with a reasonable annual fee that members can rent private meeting-rooms at, with little fear of overcrowding\u2014 and a good wine cellar, to boot. It's called The Dazed Dragon Down, and stands at the corner of Rezild Street and Taunthorl Lane.",
										"It's also where you can easily hire, by asking at the front desk, a good guide to the city; just ask for Ezeld Turraunt. Who is an old, retired civic official and looks it, but is surprisingly kind, polite, and attentive. He's not the man to guide you to the taverns and the wilder delights of Tyraturos, however; for that sort of guide, ask for Ozol Vulkym at The Bull And Blade. He seems a bit of an alley-dagger bullyblade, and sly.",

These three are Irkhann's Thond (edgy; young folk and rakes like to stay here), Dulkryn's Thond (family; old, haughty, and priciest); and the Delathond (quietest and with the most rental rooms, so most popular with escorts and with merchants like me). All three offer superb dining-lounges, so I seldom go farther to dine, though Thaeltharra's Delights on Shezluth Street offers lovely drinks and sugary confections I can't resist. If you or your client is more the seared-boar and braised whole haunch of oxen sort, seek The Flaming Hoof on Yultora's Ride.",

The general attitude in Thay these days is that anyone who uses a {@item goad|TLotRW} on a slave is a wasteful fool, and that being attacked with one is an insult to the attacked.

						"Check thy hearth for readiness. Set water near it to warm.",
						"Pluck the fowl, then wash it inside and out, pat dry. Then rub it well inside and out with salt and pepper.",

						"Wash clean the leek, dress its ends, then cut the stalk all into rings. Set aside in another small bowl.",
						"In a large bowl mix together the marjoram, oregano, sage, thyme, sarataun, a pinch of pepper, the cashew nuts (they can be whole), and the breadcrumbs. Then mix in the minced meat. Then add the cut-up apple and leek, and the wine, and mix well.",
						"Take this wet mixture and stuff the cavity or cavities of the fowl with it (worry not if you have more than will fit, but discard this excess not), using the needles and the twine. If thy fowl retains its wings, tie them to the carcass so they'll burn not in the cooking.",
						"Mix thy oil with the leftover seasoning mix ye stuffed the fowl with (if ye have none, use pinches of salt and pepper) and coat the fowl with it, all over. If thy fowl is intact enough to have a breast side, place fowl pieces or whole bird breast side up on a roasting rack.",
						"Place thy (larger, if they vary in size) roasting pan in the hearthfire, and cautiously\u2014scalding steam warning!\u2014pour warmed water into it, about the thickness of the cook's hand, or more [modern cooks: water in the pan first, then slide into lower rack of oven, fowl will go in a roasting-pan on upper rack]. Position the roasting rack above the roasting pan, and on it roast the fowl until ready [about 4 hours at 200℉ {@note 94℃}].",
						"During this time, gently warm the fowlsimmer near the hearthfire, so it spits not (it will, if used cold).",
						"When the color deepens sufficiently [after about an hour] turn the fowl over, and baste it with the fowlsimmer. Thereafter, baste several times, as you think it necessary [about every 30 minutes], but keep the remaining fowlsimmer, do not use it all.",
						"When the turned-over fowl has attained the same color as at first turning [so, about two hours into roasting], prick the legs and wings of the fowl [if any] with a fork to let the fat of the fowl fry the better.",
						"When the fowl sizzles and sings, if you wish to brown it, build up the fire around it [at the 3:45 mark of oven cooking, increase oven heat to 230℉ {@note 110℃}]. Move thy water to near enough the fire to heat, but not boil. Also move thy serving-platter near, to get warm.",
						"When thy fowl is ready, take it off the hearth-heat onto a surface that can withstand the heat, and cover it, to let it rest for the length of two long songs [let it rest out of the oven, covered, for 10 minutes].",
						"While it rests, take three small skins-worth [3 cups] of thy heated water and add to the remaining fowlsimmer, then strain this mix through a sieve.",
						"Now make ye the sauce. Wash, peel and halve the apple, core it and discard the core, and dice it. Peel the ginger and cut it up fine. Let thy sauce-portion of oil heat in thy second roasting-pan. When steam starts to rise from it, add the diced apple, ginger, cashew nuts, chestnuts, and cinnamon. Then stir once, and let fry for the length of a song [about 3 minutes]. Then pour in the sieved fowlsimmer-water mix, and build up the fire or move it to a hotter spot, to bring the pan contents to a boil. When the bubbles are hearty, stir in thy flour, and add salt and pepper to taste, and let boil hearty for less than half a song [about 1 minute], then take from heat. Let rest while ye carve the fowl, then use tongs to remove the cinnamon stick.",
						"On thy cutting surface, carve thy fowl, stuffing and all. Arrange on thy warmed platter and pour the sauce over it. (If platter not large enough for sauce, put sauce into pourer for diners to apply, but serve swiftly lest the fowl grow cold too soon.)"
