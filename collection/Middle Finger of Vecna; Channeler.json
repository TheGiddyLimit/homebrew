All of them are forged by the same type of magic, a ritual known as the Rite of Binding, which merges the essence of a portal and its key, forming a gateway between worlds, imbued with planar energies.",

Most who seek to become channelers perform the Rite of Binding on themselves, using their bodies as ritual components in place of a gate, and become linked to a key in the process. This ritual is a taxing and perilous endeavor, requiring a strong body and mind, for it was not designed to be undertaken by living things. However, those who survive becomes living gates, bound to the energies of the multiverse in the same manner as a planar portal. And just as a planar portal, they can draw from a deep well of planar energy and conduct magic through inanimate objects."

But channelers recognize that sigil sequences are not just coordinates to locations in the multiverse; they are fundamental to the greatest secret in the multiverse: the Nexus.",

It's even possible your origin is more like that of a sorcerer, that you were stricken by planar magic, and only the Rite of Binding could preserve your life. Whatever the reason, you have taken a gambit for arcane might, and won.",

If your key is a tome, what kind of book is it, in what condition do you keep it, and what information, other than spells and arcane secrets, is held within its pages? Perhaps, your key isn't an item of substantial importance; that too, is an important character note."
