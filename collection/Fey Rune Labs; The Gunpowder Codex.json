						"The existence of this document is predicated on the feeling that not all gunslingers must be fighters. Just as there is room in D&D for all classes to wield a sword (some better than others, granted), so too should all classes have an option that deals with guns.",
						"We must first credit the magnificent Matthew Mercer for his Gunslinger archetype, which is an excellent piece of work. We haven't included a Fighter archetype here because we didn't think we could do better. And just as he took inspiration from Pathfinder, we take inspiration from him, and some of our archetypes share a feature or two with the Gunslinger (primarily the simple proficiencies with firearms and {@item Tinker's Tools|PHB}). Some features have also been inspired by or adapted from Pathfinder archetypes.",
						"Each archetype has its own theme, and not every ability deals explicitly with firearms. Some are more weapon-focused than others, and others have their own twists.",

										"The Dishonored feel, of video game fame, with whale oil and supernatural dystopian overtones.",
										"The historical approach, where technology advances more slowly and spreads more slowly.",
										"Cowboys!",
										"Pirates!"

								"And, of course, combinations of these and many more that spring from the inventive minds of DMs. The point is simply to say that the inclusion of guns in your campaign doesn't define in which genre you can play\u2014it implies a level of technology, true, but even that has plenty of wiggle room.

								"First off: yes, guns are powerful. Basic guns are on par with longbows and heavy crossbows, while more advanced guns outstrip any weapons in the Player's Handbook. This is by design. Depending on how you chose to integrate firearms into your campaign, this might have one of two effects: firearms may be rare and coveted tools (much like magic items), or firearms are common enough that enemies and PCs both possess them and balance each other out.",
								"If a few player characters carry firearms, especially advanced or enchanted variants, the CR of your encounters will certainly be affected. If the encounter involves NPCs with weapons, one simple solution is to give them guns as well. This may make fights a bit faster and more brutal, but that's a historically accurate side effect of introducing guns into warfare. For DMs wanting to restrict the proliferation of firearms, simply using higher CR foes or giving the same ones more hit points should suffice."

								"As was touched on above, firearms can easily fit into many different settings, whether that's vibes of 15th century Italy, 18th century Mexico, steampunk, or something entirely different. Mechanically, though, there's probably only two things that will change about firearms in these different environments: scarcity and level of technology.",
								"For those wanting to implement firearms as they were in the early medieval period, it may be best to limit those available to basic or perhaps moderate complexity (see gear listings). Guns would probably be rare and expensive, and ammunition hard to find\u2014the simplest adjustment is perhaps to double the listed prices of basic guns, triple those of moderate complexity, and so on. Characters in such settings might have to (or want to) do more of their own crafting to offset this rarity.",
								"Inversely, characters in worlds where firearms are common face a different problem: staying alive. Guns, particularly more advanced varieties, pack a heavy punch, and player characters will probably want to have a healer, stock up on potions, or just boost their Armor Class to increase their survivability."

You may spend an action to clear the misfire (no check required), but if you do not, a second misfire will cause an explosion and break the weapon. This explosion deals the weapon's listed damage to you and any creatures or objects within five feet. Clearing a misfire out of combat similarly requires no check. Repairing a broken firearm, however, requires one hour and an Intelligence-based check with {@item Tinker's Tools|PHB} (DC 10 + the firearm's misfire score).
