Next, the character raising the companion selects its origin. Origin determines what sort of creature it is and include almost all types presented in the Monster Manual. It's similar to selecting a Race for a player character. The third step is to choose the companion's archetype from the presented options. Archetypes are like a class' ability of the same name but determines the bulk of the companion's Ability Scores, its Armor Class, Hit Die, and any special abilities it might possess. Finally, the Dungeon Master determines the companion's Temperament.",

They gain levels the same way as a player character does but cannot multiclass, have a lower Proficiency Bonus, and are designed to be weaker than a true player character but not as weak as a normal animal companion.",

It rolls for initiative like any other creature, but the Dungeon Master determines its actions, decisions, attitudes, and so on.

It expects to be protected and nurtured while it grows and while it might still act within its temperament it is still beholden to standard survival instincts.

The simple solution is to have them play a Beastmaster ranger or an arcane spellcaster who can cast find familiar, but what if a character of a different class finds an animal they wish to keep as a pet? Perhaps they don't want the hassle of dipping into a class with a built-in pet, but still want some mechanical benefit to having an animal around. Maybe your player hasn't found such an animal, but they've expressed interest in their character having some sort of animal companion. These rules allow player characters of all classes to adopt pets of their very own, while ensuring that rangers' animal companions and spellcasters' familiars remain more potent options.",

A creature must be trained before it can be effective in combat. A wild creature must be domesticated before it is trained. Finding the right place and person to purchase an animal from can be difficult; while the average human or elven city will have horses, cats, and dogs for sale, finding a pre-trained {@creature giant lizard} or flying snake may be difficult in some campaign settings. That said, a town in a deep jungle or swamp may well have such creatures for sale, while an underground city may sell {@creature giant fire} beetles to dungeon delvers.

								"Each pet adds 1 sp/day per size category to lifestyle expenses. For example, a Tiny {@creature rat} only costs 1 sp/day, while a Large {@creature warhorse} requires 4 sp/day. An owner can hunt food for their animal, or the animal can be trained to hunt for itself, halving the cost. The remaining cost represents other types of care, such as medicine, shelter, and toys. When training a domesticated animal to perform actions on command, the base lifestyle cost doubles. Thus, if you were teaching your Tiny rat to take the Perform action (described below in the Non-Combat Actions section), it would cost and additional 1 sp/ day as long as you were teaching your rat. This cost represents things like extra treats and supplies. Domesticating a wild animal increases the cost to 1 gp/day per size category. A Medium wolf, for instance, costs a full 3 gp/day to domesticate. This cost reflects the increased price of keeping the animal safely contained, and the comparatively larger amounts and more exotic types of food a wild animal requires."

They resemble common housecats at a glance, but cat siths are supernatural beings that have the cunning of civilized races and strange magical powers rivaling those of fey. They're capable of easily walking balanced on just their hind legs and wearing magic boots. They can carry one object in their front paws when walking bipedally, though they can't manipulate such objects with the fine control required to use weapons, wands, and similar objects. Unpredictable yet sophisticated, these strange beings use their unassuming appearances to infiltrate civilized areas, either serving as spies for powerful spellcasters or entertaining their own unknowable agendas. Many cultures fear cat siths and tell myths about their otherworldly powers. Some say that letting a cat sith near an unburied corpse may allow the beast to steal the departed's soul before it has made it to the Great Beyond. A 7th-level spellcaster with the Improved Familiar feat can gain a cat sith as a familiar. Cat siths are heavier than most housecats, weighing between 25 and 30 pounds. A cat sith is nearly 2 feet long from its nose to the base of its tail."

					"An emberborn is a small, canine-like creature created from ash and burning embers built around a core of molten metal. They are birthed from the pyres of creatures sacrificed to the Ashen Wolf, yet they are often friendly and pleasant to mortals. When provoked, they unleash a blast of ash and smoke before closing in with teeth like red-hot pokers. When at rest, they often sleep within fireplaces and other areas where fires are commonly stoked. They feast on raw meat whenever the opportunity presents itself, and enjoy being presented with gifts of metal and rare wood, as they enjoy devouring both in large quantities.",
					"Some say that the emberborn are the children of the Ashen Wolf, and that it cares for them as though they were its own. There are no reliable records that can prove this belief, but as intelligent elementals they are capable of speech and can thus be asked. As an emberborn feeds and ages, they will grow larger and larger. Some eldritch scholars hypothesize that the Ashen Wolf was once an emberborn, strangely enough.",
					"When summoning an emberborn deliberately, a brazier filled with wood and rare metal is presented and the blood of a sacrificed beast is poured over the open flame as the summoner performs the eldritch incantation. The fire will burn quickly, and when it is reduced to coals, the emberborn will begin to take shape. It will emerge from the fire and demand to be fed. If the summoner provides a drop of their blood to the newly born beast without hesitation, then the emberborn will smile and swear loyalty to their new master. If the summoner does not, then the emberborn will vanish into smoke and seek a forest to ignite instead."

The artist must stand before a burning brazier and establish an eldritch connection with the flame, calling upon it to cast light more fervently. Once done, they will place their hands on the far side of the fire, casting a shadow on the wall or ground. While chanting the eerie words and phrases required by this mystical rite, they will use their hands to make a shadow puppet. The chanting corresponds with a story fitting for the personality of the animate image that they desire to summon.",

At the culmination of the event, the warlock will cut a fingertip and place a single drop of blood on the shadow, infusing it with life, soul, and obedience to its creator."

					"The harrowing hawk is a large bird with stone-cold eyes that is infused with merciless ice. Bred as hunting birds by the Wild Huntsman, these creatures are far deadlier than their cruel visage belies. When they swoop down to attack their prey, they freeze the edges of their wings and slash with the ice-coated feathers, leaving the frost in the wound to slow their victim. As the ice builds, they let out a piercing cry to summon their master to strike down the target from afar. When at rest, they tend to rest upon the shoulders of their masters and gaze menacingly at those around them. They enjoy gifts of carved bone and scrimshaw, which they use to make their nests, and feast upon frozen meat with gusto.",
					"Harrowing hawks are typically solitary creatures, and rarely cooperate with one another while hunting prey. However, mated pairs are known to hunt together to devastating effect, with one scouting for the other, finding an enticing meal, then letting out a shrill cry. Before the prey can react, the second crashes down with the force of a thunderbolt, slaying the beast instantly. Then the two will perch upon the body until the snow has taken the heat from it, beginning their feast when the blood begins to freeze.",
					"When in the service to a warlock aligned to the Huntsman, they serve as scouts and harbingers to the hounds who pursue the prey, seeking to drive them into the clutches of their master. They have a strong bond with the other beasts of the Huntsman's stable, though are haughty and typically view themselves as the most favored of beasts. The steeds may carry, and the hounds may enjoy the master's affections, but the hawks were the first, and the hawks will be the last. Their pride will lead them to seemingly impossible feats of nighsuicidal bravery, such as tearing the eyes from sorcerers and diving down the throats of dragons to cleave about with their razor-sharp wings."

					"The imperial cobra is one of the deadliest venomous snakes, and their bloodline has been infused with the magic of the Serpent Empress, granting them speech and cunning. Hatched from a long lineage bred to be spies, assassins, and assistants to courtiers, these cobras are malicious and devious. Their venom is potent and infused with powerful magic that enables it to harm even those protected against such toxins. When at rest, they seek out small animals, such as rats or birds, and torment them for entertainment, gradually injecting small amounts of venom until the creature dies in horrible agony. These cobras enjoy flattery as well as games of wit and chance, and gleefully accept gifts of precious gemstones, jewelery, mirrors, exotic meats, and eggs from reptiles and birds alike.Summoning an imperial cobra is easier said than done. The proper incantations and utterances are difficult to pronounce without a forked tongue, and so it is rarely done by any who are not servants of the Empress. As the ritual proceeds, the summoner must inscribe a small, fang-shaped mark upon their hand before holding it over the fire of a brazier, offering it to the cobra. The beast will emerge from within the fire initially as a serpent of green flame, coiling and hissing with malicious intent. The flaming snake will strike at the offered hand, burning a thin line through the inscribed fang. If the summoner remains calm and still through this process, they will succeed in the rite, gifting the serpent with life and causing it to become corporeal. If they express emotion or pain, then an agonizing toxin will flood their veins and the ritual will be disrupted.",
					"Most servants of the Empress will offer the imperial cobra some form of identifying jewelry, so that it may more clearly express its superiority over all lesser creatures. It serves its master as an equal, subservient only to their wishes by the fact of the magic binding them rather than any true loyalty. The oath of a snake means little, except when it is made to the ruler of the Endless Empire."

They glow with radiant power in the darkness of the night, and drive back the shadows that would hide the lost artifacts and rituals needed to complete their task. These shards are singleminded in their quest, and cannot be turned aside by danger. When their charge is threatened, they willingly sacrifice themselves as the Exile was willing to, seeking to save their fallen comrade at the cost of their own lives. They still bear that spark of scorn for mortality that their originator once held, however, and strike with malevolent light whenever they witness the fall of a mortal foe. Summoning a luminous shard is fairly simple, by comparison to some of the other familiars. One must simply stand before the brazier, ignite it, and speak passionately about something they desire or something they have lost. The tongues of flame will begin to burn a warm blue and gold while moving together into a humanoid figure. The summoner must then gently offer a hand, and assist the tiny entity out of the brazier. As it exits, it will solidify into a luminous shard. The summoner must then declare their purpose in life, as they see it at that moment. If they are truthful, then the shard will swear loyalty in a series of gestures and serve faithfully as a familiar from then on. If they are deceptive, then the shard will shed a tear of molten crystal, shatter into fragments, and rejoin the Exile in the skies above."

Their songs are legendary for leading travelers astray, however, and they are often viewed with mistrust and suspicion by folk in less civilized lands. Summoning a symphonic songbird involves singing, as one might expect. The brazier is lit, the incense is burned, and the summoner must begin a melody of their own creation. It must be carefully done, so that there is room for another to harmonize without interruption or disruption, and is often difficult for novices. Once the song reaches the correct moment, the fire within the brazier will coalesce into the image of a songbird, and it will begin to sing along with its new master. The summoner must continue their song to an appropriate closing, guiding the bird out from the brazier at the same time. Once it has emerged fully and is corporeal, the warlock must end the song and speak their name. The symphonic songbird will repeat the name perfectly, and then speak its own. When the warlock does the same and speaks the songbird's name in exact mimicry, the bond between familiar and master will be formed."

					"A deadly thing that lurks in the pockets of countless saints and villains alike, money is a tool that brings both salvation and misery. Not all funds can be trusted, however. The Currency Conspiracy has been gradually replacing the original currencies of the world with karensee, colloquially known as wealth mimics. They can take an endless number of forms, but they are restricted, unlike their larger kin. These mimics can only choose to turn into objects that appear to be of value. A gold coin, a bill, a gemstone, a necklace of pearls: all of these things are potential wealth mimics. Most of them are asleep, trapped in a singular form. They feign damage or other ill effects while they are sleeping, behaving exactly like natural materials. However, when they are awakened by eldritch magic, they come to life and attack those who sought to own them. Members of the Currency conspiracy often call and awaken wealth mimics using a ritualistic rite, but any warlock of sufficient power and knowledge can summon one.",
					"The first steps are relatively easy. The summoner must ignite the brazier and stand adjacent to it, speaking the correct incantations. Once the fire has burned down to embers, the summoner must insert a single object of value that a wealth mimic could imitate, such as a coin or bank note.",
					"Next, the warlock must offer blood. When a few drops are applied to the object within the brazier, the flames will flare to life once more, consuming the object and then disappearing. The ashes will begin to form together into a shape identical to that of the object, and a new wealth mimic will be born. It will speak a single word, giving itself a name. So long as that name is known by its master, it will obey perfectly, changing shape and killing on command.",
					"Wealth mimics enjoy being fed other currency. Some scholars whisper that this is intended to give them power, but others suspect that they are simply innately cannibalistic. Those in the Conspiracy are believed to have created the wealth mimics with a built-in safety measure, in case something goes wrong with the final plan. In that instance, they would consume one another in a frenzy after being deprived of other flesh, rendering them harmless to those they could not reach."

Next, the character raising the companion selects its origin. Origin determines what sort of creature it is and include almost all types presented in the Monster Manual. It's similar to selecting a Race for a player character. The third step is to choose the companion's archetype from the presented options. Archetypes are like a class' ability of the same name but determines the bulk of the companion's Ability Scores, its Armor Class, Hit Die, and any special abilities it might possess. Finally, the Dungeon Master determines the companion's Temperament.",
						"The specifics of creating an animal companion are explained in depth later in this section. They gain levels the same way as a player character does but cannot multiclass, have a lower Proficiency Bonus, and are designed to be weaker than a true player character but not as weak as a normal animal companion.",
						"Mechanically, the companion obeys its master's commands as best it can. It rolls for initiative like any other creature, but the Dungeon Master determines its actions, decisions, attitudes, and so on. Alternatively, if the companion trusts and respects its master, its actions in combat are controlled by the player character or the group  as a whole.",

It expects to be protected and nurtured while it grows and while it might still act within its temperament it is still beholden to standard survival instincts. These creatures know they are not powerful enough to face down even the common goblin or imp until they have grown into a juvenile stage."

All of these are perfectly valid solutions that help make this system more flexible. Remember, you always have the final say but should try to be accommodating and reasonable."
