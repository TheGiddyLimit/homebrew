They are often mysterious figures, traveling the wild places alone or in the company of Fae and beasts, until they sense their services are needed. Then they emerge from the forest, bringing revels to a returning army or farming village exhausted from long labor, rivers of wine to the thirsty, bounteous feasts to the hungry, and, when required, punishment to the rigid and oppressive, those rulers whose love of order and deprivation become too strong. Such druids are feared by tyrants across Arkadia, for there are tales of such wanderers\u2014Phaedrus themself in disguise\u2014who tear them down from their thrones and remind them what they are, often by turning them into whatever beast they seem most like, humiliating them and stripping them of power for their own good and the good of Arkadia.",

They patrol the wild places of the world, the vast forgotten wilderness and untamed borderlands where feral Fae and the monstrous spawn of titans roam unchecked, culling their numbers and watching for signs of greater threats on the horizon. They are the wardens of Arkadia, and stand among the titans' most bitter enemies. Oreya's chosen fight on all fronts, patrolling the mountains of Gargaros on the lookout for orc raids, protecting Ithean sailors from swarming merrow, supporting the Krytan army against gorgon hordes, and patrolling the Arkadian roads, warding the common folk against bandits and feral Fae. Many make a living as monster hunters, hired by kings and generals to take down fierce beasts when all others have failed. Oreyan elves have a proud ranger tradition, and some of the fiercest amazons are among their number. Rangers of the Hunter archetype are common in Crixos, where they hunt powerful undead and corrupted Fae, and Phaedran hunters have been known to hunt with animal companions owing to their strong ties to nature.",

Invariably well-spoken, charming, and ingenious, tricksters hatch brilliant, daring schemes, turning from rags to riches and back again. Such rogues thrive in Illyria, a chaotic city of wealth and political intrigue, where they rule the noble houses, each seeking to outmaneuver the others. Many rogues hail from the Illyrian nobility themselves, or eventually find themselves caught up in their games, gravitating toward the status and coin they offer. Others are spread far and wide, earning the favor of kings and queens and directing events in their favor. Less politically inclined rogues become smugglers and tomb raiders, bandits and treasure hunters, sailing as far as distant Nys and Psysseria to bring back exotic, forbidden wares in defiance of the Ithean fleet.",

Thessa next, grey eyed, and wiser than her father still. Then Crixys dark; and Lyria, more beautiful than all the rest. Two children she had already, born of sky and stone, eldest of their kin. Oreya, fierce and cunning and Erebos, of stunted form, though undiminished in his skill.}",

Erebos went slowly the north, to claim a mountain of his own. All the wilds in between, were left to Oreya and her endless hunt. And in the bosom of the land, on highest peak\u2014Hyperius upon carven throne.}",

At once they came, those creatures of unspoken names, and each a god befell. They did battle with the gods so great the earth trembled and the sky wheeled above... Each in turn was repelled. Wounded, bound, or killed, they were driven back to the corners of the world, to in darkness writhe.}",

They make war with the other orc clans who defy the Hydra: the Cyclopax with their mighty one-eyed juggernauts, and the Cerberi who tame massive three-headed beasts as mounts and hunters.

Many of the mightiest Hydrak wield sorceries of fire and darkness granted by their masters, and tales, scarcely to be believed, tell of fallen philosophers and other twisted mortals seeking pacts with these creatures, walking unmolested through Gargaros' ash-choked expanse to fated meetings where they pledge themselves in service to the hydra and their father for similar secrets, returning to Arkadia to work the dark will of their new patron.",

However, like other monstrous spawn of the titans, the hydra cannot stand its touch themselves, the pure metal searing their flesh on contact.

This rare golden-bronze metal, sacred to Eberos, is found only in Gargaros, drawn from the fiery peaks of that broken land. Many horrible monstrosities bound to the Titans are seared by its golden touch, making its weapons prized by the bravest of Arkadia's heroes. Weapons and armor that are wrought from it are more precious than gold, though they can never be sold, only given.",

They make crystal glass and beaten lead funeral masks in Crixos; jewelry in Corinth; and rams, nails, and all the tools needed to furnish Ithean ships.

Unfortunate outcasts wander the sands of Nys, withered husks, their burned skin wrapped in bandages, white eyes seared blind by the sun. Some lucky few exiled drow are found by tomb raiders, Arkadians set out from Crixos, who sail across the sea to plunder forgotten treasures from the sandswept ruins of cursed Nys.",

Immune to the plague and imbued with a proclivity for the undead, they are met by the Crixian priests with hostility and mistrust, begrudgingly accepted only for the utility of their strange gifts. They are welcomed by the Crixian Philosophers' school who hold no reservations about necromancy, viewing it as a tool with which to fight fire with fire. They offer Nyssian drow a place in their ranks in exchange for occult secrets and ancient embalmic formulae."
