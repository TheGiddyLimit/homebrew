Sometimes the use of Chronomancy is policed by organizations which lie outside space and time, preventing others from practicing this magic. The spells {@spell Haste|XPHB}, {@spell Slow|XPHB}, and {@spell Time Stop|XPHB} also deserve the [Chronomancy] tag, but have been familiar to spellcasters far longer than spells like {@spell Delay|ValdaPlayerPack} and {@spell Paradox|ValdaPlayerPack}."
