Finding a class 5 node is so rare that such a discovery often heralds great changes for the discoverers, and often a bitter struggle to maintain control as various factions fight over the powerful node. Entire cities or cultures are often built around powerful nodes. A node with a high class rating is actually a series of nodal shells with strength increasing by 1 class for each layer further in, with the innermost shell having the highest node rating. For instance, a class 3 node is actually a class 1 node, surrounding a class 2 node, which surrounds a class 3 node at the center.

The difference between an abyss and a vault is difficult to define, but as a general rule, a vast space approachable from its higher reaches is an abyss, while the same space approachable from the floor might be better described as a vault. Abysses tend to be larger and deeper than areas that are considered vaults, but this is not always the case.",

												"Over the course of a hundred or more centuries, Faerûn's deep caverns and vaults have been expanded tremendously by the delving of various Underdark races. Thus, the term dungeon when applied to the Underdark means a structure excavated from the surrounding rock by intelligent creatures. For example, a great duergar city delved into the wall of a vault might be considered a large dungeon, with halls and passageways extending for miles from its entrance-ways. Dungeon complexes often serve to link two natural features (such as two or more vaults close to each other) with a system of artificial caves that vastly extends the scope of a natural cave system.",
												"Dungeons come in two varieties\u2014abandoned and occupied. Since they are not sources of food or water in and of themselves, empty dungeons do not necessarily attract Underdark settlers.

												"Since gorges can run for many miles, they often serve as the highways of the Underdark. Travel along the floor of a gorge can be very difficult, but many Underdark races take steps to improve these natural roads for the use of their own merchants and hunters. Gorges also offer good opportunities to change depth and perhaps access another level quickly, through a little climbing."

In many areas, the water table is close enough to the surface that only the most shallow cave systems can form. However, due to the unusual factors involved in the creation of Faerûn's Underdark, a water table 20 feet below-ground does not necessarily mean that air-filled caves don't exist at greater depths. Planar connections, particularly to the Planes of Earth and Water, make very unlikely hydrology possible.",
												"Typically, a body of fresh water is called a lake. Underdark lakes range in size from small pools to inland seas hundreds of miles in extent. Large lakes typically occupy either tremendous vaults or connected networks of partially submerged caves. The Lake of Shadows and the Giant's Chalice are examples of the former type, and the Darklake is an example of the latter. If a lake has both an inlet and an outlet, its water is usually drinkable, but lakes that are not refreshed from time to time may stagnate.",
												"Most lakes are found in the Upperdark or Middledark. Bodies of water that collect in the Lowerdark simply can't drain to any lower elevations, so they tend to be seas (brackish water) instead. However, planar connections to the Elemental Plane of Water mean that at least a few of the bodies of water in the Lowerdark hold fresh water.",

Rifts may be dozens or even hundreds of miles in length, and sometimes miles deep, but they are rarely very wide\u2014most are less than a bow-shot across.",
												"Rifts sometimes break apart preexisting features such as cave systems, presenting formidable obstacles to creatures traveling through caves. In order to continue when faced with a rift, the traveler must climb or descend to the appropriate level on the far side.

While air-filled cave systems may extend for dozens or even hundreds of miles beneath the oceans above, or form air-locked siphons of extraordinary size, these features are exceptional. Most caves beneath large bodies of saltwater are simply subterranean extensions of surface oceans.",

Unlike a gorge or a rift, a shaft tends to be a relatively small feature (usually less than a bow shot in diameter), but it may plummet for miles straight down.",
												"Because of their relatively small crosssections, shafts often serve to channel air movement between disparate portions of the Underdark. In places where the conditions are extreme (for example, a shaft near a superheated magma chamber), the air movement can also be extreme. Screaming winds might roar up or down a shaft in a scouring blast that would put a hurricane to shame. Sometimes, cave systems \"breathe\" in conjunction with changes in the surface world above, resulting in tremendous rushes of wind in and out through shafts every day."

Underdark races often cut very ambitious tunnels to link multiple cave systems. Though such dreary passageways may be dozens of miles in length, most are only 10 or 20 feet across. Other tunnels are the work of burrowing monsters such as delvers, purple worms, and umber hulks. These \"natural\" tunnels may be twisting, turning mazes of intersecting passages.",
												"Tunnels are some of the Underdark's most useful roads, but they severely restrict a traveler's options. If you don't like where a tunnel leads, you really have no choice but to go back the way you came. Tunnels also offer few hiding places for those who can't blend in with stone, so often the only way to escape from a predator is to run\u2014and hope you're faster."

												"The higher reaches of the Underdark consist of immense networks of relatively small caves, but as a traveler descends, the numbers of caves decreases while the size of the individual caves increases. A large cave near the surface may consist of a few dozen linked chambers, each perhaps a few hundred feet long and a few dozen feet wide. But deeper down are openings in the earth that dwarf any surface dweller's conception of a cave.",
												"A typical vault may be 2 to 4 miles across and as much as 1 mile high. Some, however, sprawl for 50 miles or more and reach heights of 5 or 6 miles from the floor. Larger vaults often feature immense columns\u2014huge piers of natural rock that help to buttress the soaring ceiling. Some were formed by unthinkably massive pieces of the world grinding past each other in the very dawn of time, others by the influence of the Underdark's native magic, and still others by the confluence of planar characteristics in buried planar connections. However it was formed, a vault is a world in miniature, with its own streams, lakes, hills, and plateaus all contained in a single vast cavern.",
												"Vaults are almost always highly desirable territories, since they usually offer enough space and resources to support huge forests of fungus, moss, and other strange growths. By Underdark standards, most vaults teem with life, so it comes as no surprise that they support the most powerful and numerous of Underdark settlements. Some stories even tell of illuminated vaults, places where sun-bright crystals in the ceilings blaze with the intensity of true daylight and support green plants and surface-like fauna in abundance."

												"It is not universally true in Faerûn that descending 40 or 50 miles straight down in any spot brings a traveler to magma. Volcanic activity is extremely variable in the Underdark. Isolated pools of magma seep up almost to the surface in all sorts of places without any other volcanic activity, and in other places deep tunnels and vaults support humanoid settlements at depths where magma should be all that's present. Again, planar anomalies, deific intervention, and the powerful magic of the earth itself are likely to blame. Whatever the cause of these surprising conditions, racing rivers of molten rock, caverns full of brimstone and sulfurous reek, and scalding geysers and hot springs can be found at almost any depth in the Underdark. Underdark volcanoes aren't really mountains\u2014they are usually tremendous fissures or magma chambers that can vomit deadly rivers of lava into nearby caverns with little or no warning."

You are on the trail of love, that most precious and mysterious of emotions, and your search fills your stories and your songs with vitality and passion."

From the morning-after tale of a tavern brawl to the saga of an epic battle, from a lover's spat to a rift between powerful dynasties, conflict is what inspires tale-tellers like you to create your best work. Conflict can bring out the best in some people, causing their heroic nature to shine forth and transform the world, but it can cause others to gravitate toward darkness and fall under the sway of evil. You strive to experience or witness all forms of conflict, great and small, so as to study this eternal aspect of life and immortalize it in your words and music."

That rule gives you a tremendous amount of flexibility, making it easy to amass an array of beast form options for yourself, but you must abide by the limitations in the Beast Shapes table in that book.",
								"When you gain Wild Shape as a 2nd-level druid, you might wonder which beasts you've already seen. The following tables organize beasts from the monster manual according to the beasts' most likely environments. Consider the environment your druid grew up in, then consult the appropriate table for a list of animals that your druid has probably seen by 2nd level.",
								"These tables can also help you and your DM determine which animals you might see on your travels. In addition, the tables include each beast's challenge rating and note whether a beast has a flying or swimming speed. This information will help you determine whether you qualify to assume that beast's form.",
								"The tables include all the individual beasts that are eligible for Wild Shape (up to a challenge rating of 1) or the Circle Forms feature of the Circle of the Moon (up to a challenge rating of 6).",
