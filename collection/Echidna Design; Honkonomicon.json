												"Originally, Anserath was created by Pazuzu, flying lord of the abyssal skies, as a tool to spread extreme destruction and confusion on its enemies. However, right after being set loose towards its first battle, the Honking Chaos became completely impossible to control and went on its own way, with terrible mayhem for all sides involved.",
												"Right after that, {@creature Demogorgon|MTF} himself claimed Anserath as his own guardian beast and pet, as the two found significant kinship in their mutual madness and primordial chaotic nature. For eons, the Raging Mouths accompanied the Prince of Demons in battle and kept him company in their shared lair, to the point of becoming known as Demogorgon's Pet.",
												"However, not even the twin-headed demon lord had the ability to tame such a creature forever. Eventually, Anserath ran away from its master to never come back, glad to let loose its rage on any being encountered without restrictions. It is said that Demogorgon's paranoia played a role in this decision, even if Anserath's unpredictable nature might be enough of an explanation.",
												"In more recent times, the Honking Chaos has been sighted mostly roaming around Yeenoghu's Realm, especially in the outskirts of the Seeping Woods. The Prince of Gnolls seems to be proud to call the demon a guest of its realm, and formally considers Anserath as a vassal, even if no such official claim has been made. As opposed to what {@creature Demogorgon|MTF} did, {@creature Yeenoghu|MTF} seems to understand and respect the Raging Mouths as a creature of its own: not a pet, but a savage beast with a wild nature that just can't be tamed. Yeenoghu's followers are taught to not bother Anserath or engage it during combat, and to get out of its way when it's \"hunting\" (more like \"purposelessly destroying\"). At the same time, the troops of the Prince of Gnolls (or the Prince himself) often follow after Anserath's, taking advantage of the mayhem left behind while trying to not catch too much of its attention.",
												"Another location where The Honking Chaos can often be spotted is the Endless Maze, the layer of the Abyss that {@creature Baphomet|MTF} claims as his home. The two beast-shaped demon lords seem to enjoy repeatedly fighting each other, and they have a relationship that walks the line between friends and foes."

On the other hand, if the characters find away to tame or capture the creature, its master will greatly compensate them.
