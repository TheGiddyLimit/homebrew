						"This is a world of champions and monsters, of nations rising and falling in wars of conquest and magic. The many lands of Runeterra are bursting with adventures of all kinds, from gritty street-level brawls to epic battles between supernatural powers, and Bilgewater is no exception. Packed to the gills with smugglers, scofflaws, and scoundrels, Bilgewater is more than a common pirate haven, though it has more than its fair share of pirates, too!",
						"Even though this version of Bilgewater is described in great detail, and adheres to Runeterra canon as frequently as possible, the adventures and story hooks in this source aren't canon. Let this free you from the need to create stories that stick to canon details. Make up as many new stories, dangers, and characters as you please! Your version of Bilgewater is the only one that's important, so long as you and your friends are having fun.",
						"A number of Runeterra's mightiest champions call Bilgewater their home. The gunslinging pirate legends Miss Sarah Fortune and Gangplank have famously battled for control of Bilgewater, and countless scoundrels have aligned themselves with these warring powers, seeking to wind up on top when the gunsmoke clears. Masters of the ocean depths like the armored Nautilus and occult powers like the kraken priestess Illaoi and the eldritch River King Tahm Kench pay frequent visits to the grimy shores of Bilgewater.",
						"These champions are far from the only people making waves in Bilgewater, however. You now have the chance to create your own characters and explore Runeterra's most remarkable port, going on grand nautical adventures on galleons, exploring the unforgiving depths of the sea, or delving into the unknown mysteries of the dark magic that lurks in Bilgewater's shadows. If you're a player, start by reading the introduction of {@book chapter 2: Heroes and Scoundrels of Bilgewater|LoRDToB|2} and start making your character.",
						"Once you have your characters, your Dungeon Master (DM) can use {@book chapter 3: Herald of the Harrowing|LoRDToB|3} to start your heroes' adventures in Runeterra. This adventure is a pre-made story set in Bilgewater to start your group's stories. This adventure assumes that your characters are mercenary adventurers seeking profit and excitement among the waves.",
						"After you complete this adventure, your DM can use the rest of this source to create brand-new adventures for your group. Once your first adventure is over, start thinking of a backstory and traits for your character and show that to your DM. Those will help your DM create a story that positions you and your friends' characters as the story's heroes, not just glorified errand-runners for high-level NPCs.",

These refugees sought to escape the oppressive rule of the mainland factions, wishing to start anew. Through luck and tenacity, these refugees built a life for themselves, and news of their new settlement began to spread. The cove that now forms Bilgewater was well hidden, dotted with spots to dock vessels, and better yet covered in abandoned ruins for shelter. These qualities made it an ideal hiding place for ships, and the settlers' resentment of mainland law made it an attractive port for pirates. As piracy ebbed and flowed in Runeterra with the rise and fall of factions, the cove remained a safe base for those evading the iron fist of naval forces.",
								"Inevitably, as more crews began to use the cove, the settlement began to expand. Traders willing to deal in stolen wealth, and entrepreneurs ready to cater to these crews set up shop amidst the ruins of the cove. The hardy settlers began to construct more permanent buildings, using found materials to build on top of the ruin foundations.",

They approached the people of Bilgewater and held council with those most influential in the settlement. The Buhru agreed to allow the expansion of Bilgewater, on the condition that the city would never expand beyond the bay's confines. The people agreed to the terms, and with this victory in hand, Bilgewater began to flourish.",

Even with these restrictions, the Buhru religion is growing in popularity amongst all the peoples of the city. This popularity has a great deal to do with the current spiritual leader of the Buhu, a priestess named Illaoi, who bears the honored title of Truth Bearer. Illaoi has been a staunch ally in protecting Bilgewater against the harmful effects of the Harrowing and is well regarded by the citizenry. When Gangplank ruled Bilgewater, Illaoi and the Buhru were close allies. With Gangplank's fall from grace, it remains unclear what role the Buhru will play in the politics of leadership. "
