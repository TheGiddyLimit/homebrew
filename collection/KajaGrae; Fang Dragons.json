Savage combatants, even by draconic standards, fang dragons relish the chance to consume the flesh of other creatures, and happily wade into the fray for the chance to enjoy their favorite meal.",
									"The most physically terrifying of the dragons, fang dragons are armored with bony plates that rise into projecting spurs at limb joints and end in long, forked tails tipped with a pair of scythe-like bone blades. Their body plates are a mottled gray and brown, and a faint scent of blood surrounds the fang dragon. Their wings are small but muscled, and while they fly poorly, they can rise with a single clap of their wings to lunge forward. A fang dragon's head is adorned with many small horns or spikes, with their eyes tending to be glittering red or orange.",
									"{@b Angry and Twisted.} Twisted by the magical energies that created them, fang dragons are prone to random violence and outbursts of rage. They revel in the violence, and when they feel they have the advantage, they wade into the fray with fervor. Over time, they learn to yoke the anger and use it to their advantage. Brutal and vicious, creatures seeking out fang dragons should do so with extreme caution, as they will not hesitate to wreak havoc on any creature that they deem weaker them themselves and are perceived as a threat or an annoyance.",
									"{@b Consummate Hunters.} Fang dragons eat all manner of fresh meat, especially enjoying the flesh of intelligent creatures. They prefer to seek food far from their lairs, and will use their ability to mimic sounds they have heard to lure in prey. Fang dragons have a disturbing tendency to play with their food in an exceedingly cruel way. Fang dragons are masters of physical combat, and every part of their body is lethal. They do not have a breath weapon, but their bite is so devastating, that it can cause Constitution damage due to blood loss from the deep lacerations.",
									"{@b Hunted and Dwindling.} Once Tiamat learned of the existence of these dragons outside of her control, she attempted to subjugate the species. Sending her followers out to find them, and \"improve\" the eggs of their hatchlings with a ritual that would turn them into what would become known as the gray dragons, those same gray dragons were charged with purifying the remaining fang dragons. Hunted,with their numbers dwindling, fang dragons detest Tiamat and all her followers, and will attack them on sight.

Savage combatants, even by draconic standards, fang dragons relish the chance to consume the flesh of other creatures, and happily wade into the fray for the chance to enjoy their favorite meal.",
									"The most physically terrifying of the dragons, fang dragons are armored with bony plates that rise into projecting spurs at limb joints and end in long, forked tails tipped with a pair of scythe-like bone blades. Their body plates are a mottled gray and brown, and a faint scent of blood surrounds the fang dragon. Their wings are small but muscled, and while they fly poorly, they can rise with a single clap of their wings to lunge forward. A fang dragon's head is adorned with many small horns or spikes, with their eyes tending to be glittering red or orange.",
									"{@b Angry and Twisted.} Twisted by the magical energies that created them, fang dragons are prone to random violence and outbursts of rage. They revel in the violence, and when they feel they have the advantage, they wade into the fray with fervor. Over time, they learn to yoke the anger and use it to their advantage. Brutal and vicious, creatures seeking out fang dragons should do so with extreme caution, as they will not hesitate to wreak havoc on any creature that they deem weaker them themselves and are perceived as a threat or an annoyance.",
									"{@b Consummate Hunters.} Fang dragons eat all manner of fresh meat, especially enjoying the flesh of intelligent creatures. They prefer to seek food far from their lairs, and will use their ability to mimic sounds they have heard to lure in prey. Fang dragons have a disturbing tendency to play with their food in an exceedingly cruel way. Fang dragons are masters of physical combat, and every part of their body is lethal. They do not have a breath weapon, but their bite is so devastating, that it can cause Constitution damage due to blood loss from the deep lacerations.",

Sending her followers out to find them, and \"improve\" the eggs of their hatchlings with a ritual that would turn them into what would become known as the gray dragons, those same gray dragons were charged with purifying the remaining fang dragons. Hunted,with their numbers dwindling, fang dragons detest Tiamat and all her followers, and will attack them on sight.
