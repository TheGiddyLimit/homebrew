							"Also known as Fire-Pike Wyverns, Agnaktor has developed the remarkable ability to swim through lava, meaning it can both sneak up on prey and escape from a more powerful enemy. It has a very strong beak, which it uses to burrow straight through hard volcanic rock at incredible speeds. While swimming it swallows some of the lava and stores it in its body so that it can produce its powerful lava beam. Produced between Agnaktor's scales is a non-flammable substance that never burns. This substance allows Aganktor to coat its hide with lava and swim in lava. The molten rock on its body will eventually harden into a thick armor of rock, but when the Agnaktor touches lava, its coating becomes soft again.",
							"Agnaktor sits at the top of the food chain in the Volcanic regions they reside in. Herbivores and weaker monsters such as {@creature ioprey|MHMM}, {@creature iodrome|MHMM} and {@creature volvidon|MHMM} make up most of their diet. They will also feed on carcasses if given the opportunity. However, they still have to compete with other predators such as {@creature rathalos|MHMM}, {@creature tetsucabra|MHMM}, {@creature glavenus|MHMM} and the nomadic {@creature deviljho|MHMM}.",
							"Despite Agnaktor being powerful predators, they are known to leave their habitat when a powerful monster appears or during a volcanic eruption. During the Breeding Season, both males and females will swim to the summit of an active volcano to mate, this is also where most Agnaktor learn the dig through the ceiling technique. The female will then make a nest somewhere near the top and then give live birth to 2-30 {@creature uroktor|MHMM|individuals} at a time.",

							"A wyvern truly wrapped in mystery. Known to some as the black god and to others as the tyrant of fire, this large and brutal creature is known to most as Akantor. It has strong forelimbs, thick spikes, a clawed tail and large tusks. The Akantor bears a strong resemblance to {@creature Tigrex|MHMM}, the differences being that Akantor has only the barest nubs of forewings left, making it incapable of flight, and its immense size, which dramatically slows down its movements. Akantor are nomadic in nature, meaning they can be found just about anywhere though Akantor have primarily been found in areas within Volcanoes.",
							"The average size of an adult Akantor is approximately 3049cm. An Akantor's shell is perfectly suited to the volcanic belt. It can burrow into the lava and stay there for a short period of time due to its thick shell. The large spikes on its back are very sturdy and firm, but not completely devoid of movement; said spikes can be seen slightly moving when the creature exerts powerful movements. These spikes also help deter airborne attacks.",
							"Akantors are so powerful, they can have extremely negative effects on the environment they reside in. Predator and prey flee from Akantors and only the largest wyverns and Elder Dragons even dare challenge them. An Akantor's fangs are equally effective at burrowing into dense lava as they are at killing an armored monster. Produced inside Akantor's mouth is a deadly acid used to digest prey more easily. Akantor also possesses a thick, spiked tail, which is used as a weapon for swatting foes. It doesn't have an organ that produces breath-based attacks, but it is also able to produce a powerful sonic blast. This blast is used to attack prey and to destroy obstacles from long distances.",
							"Akantors are highly aggressive and predatory. They will attack and kill almost anything on sight, often letting out a deafening roar before charging head-on. When not actively hunting or in combat, Akantor still appear aggressive, destroying whatever bothers them as they travel to their destination. Its own name in some villages means Disaster. Some of the extremes it has been seen with include droughts and heavy thunderstorms.",

							"Almudron is a massive Leviathan found in bogged areas. Both the dorsal side of its body and its legs are covered by a gray-colored shell with some darker highlights. The shell forms two ridges on its neck reminiscent of {@creature Lagiacrus|MHMM}'s hood. Four more of these ridges adorn the body, running right to the tip of its tail. Almudron has scaly skin ranging in color from gray to creamy yellow to pinkish red. Its underbelly is covered in wide, pinkish scales. Almudron's head features some mammalian-like traits, sporting a short snout, a pair of red eyes, and several whisker-like tendrils. Similar to {@creature Mizutsune|MHMM}, it has massive, curved claws on its front legs, which have five digits, while the claws on the hind legs are smaller. The most prominent trait of Almudron is its massive tail that spans about half of the Leviathan's entire length. At the end of the tail are several feather-like appendages that it can utilize for attacking foes with mud.",
							"Almudron is said to normally live deep in mountains. However, maybe due to the influence of the Rampage, it has been approaching human settlements and attacking hunters as of late.",
							"It is capable of using mud to attack, creating a massive mud wave from swiping its tail. It is also capable of digging into the muddy soil and bursting out, reaching great heights as it does so. Almudron can also create massive mud walls and mud piles, which it can use to trap or block off prey and foes alike. Such a feat is achievable due to the golden fluid it secretes from the tail, which dissolve soil into a muddy mire. Any hunters who get stuck in the golden mud will have their health drained.",

From its back rise more pointed fins, whereas its underside is grey and scaled. because it flies through the air and spends no time on land, Amatsu has almost vestigial feet and small, nearly useless back legs.

When angered, red veins stand out more prominently in its wing membranes, and when near death, its chest, horns and eyes shine with a faint golden luminescence.",

Its horns are large compared to the size of its head, much closer to the size of the fins. These horns show that nothing will attack Amatsu due to its sheer power. Its forearms are long, they are slender and designed for flight, not for walking. The amount of webbing in its fins and wings makes the Amatsu seem larger than it actually is, as they billow out in the wind. Its actual body structure is very close to a Leviathan, long and curvy, with small back legs and a fairly large tail. Its control over storms surpasses even that of {@creature Kushala Daora|MHMM}, this power comes from a unique jade colored organ called the \"Storm Vesicle\".",
							"This organ stores large amounts of water and is how Amatsu is able to produce its terrifying storms. Unlike Kushala Daora, its wind aura does not protect it from attacks; instead, it seems to be used more aggressively as a way of making its charging attacks more dangerous. Its most deadly form of attack is a massive beam of wind and water fired from its mouth; when the beam hits the ground, it releases a torrent of water on anything nearby the point of impact. Once a Amatsu dies, the storm it made will dissipate within seconds. Showing this unique hard jade colored organ has great power.",

The Leshen's head is an animal's skull, topped by a pair of antlers unlike anything seen in the Old or New World. The Leshen seemingly lacks any functioning eyes, mouth or any features expected from the head of a living monster. Indeed, in its own world it is thought to be a nature spirit rather than any kind of living creature.",

Its head is red and blue with the same pulsing luminescence but when drained of its water and dried out, it has a milky tan coloring that affects both its body and the underside of its wings. It also has multiple long whiskers on the lower jaw.",
					"As with most Elder Dragons, most monsters flee from its mere presence. It asserts itself as the top of the food chain. What it consumes, however, is a mystery. Based on its needlelike dental structure, it can be assumed it preys on fish and possibly piscine wyverns. Only other Elder Dragons and the recently discovered {@creature Savage Deviljho|MHMM}, of which the Brute Wyvern is capable of  equaling its strength, seem to be willing to challenge it.",
					"Namielle is a very unique Elder Dragon its body carries semblance of various creatures found in the ocean. Its wings resemble that of a manta ray's, while the tips can discharge electricity like an electric eel. The membrane of its wings and parts of its face glows with a bioluminescent light that pulses with the color of the rainbow and it has large, needle-shaped teeth like deep-sea fish. There are also combs on its wings like a comb jelly, gifting it further bioluminescence. Its most notable feature, however, is its ability to produce, control and absorb water.",
					"However, said water doesn't appear to be pure water but a mix of its internal saliva and water mixed together to create a slime like water that adheres and stays moist for extended periods of time. This water is shot out of its mouth and can be absorbed back in freely and with a wave of its wings or front claws it can make hunters standing on this water slide back and forth at will. It can also shoot this water at the ground causing a tidal wave to surge up. Even more interesting is that Namielle can actually produce electricity and use the lightning to cause its water patches to electrify then explode violently into steam.",
					"Something rather unique to Namielle is that it can fly even when barely flapping its wings and glide through the air as a manta ray does in water. Namielle also seems to have the ability to blot out the sun with its body, which causes instant darkness. However, it should be noted that this ability was only demonstrated upon initially finding it.",

							"Known as the \"Thunder Wyvern.\" Astalos body is almost entirely covered in sharp, dark green plating, although it has a more bright colored underside. Unlike any other Flying Wyvern, Astalos' wings resemble those of an insect, most precisely a glasswing butterfly's wings. Its thin legs have three toes. Its tail is long, making up almost half of the monster's length, and it has two pair of earwig-like pincers at the tip. It has a relatively small head, with a big horn on top of it. Its eyes are red.",
							"Astalos are high up in the food chain. They are known to be predators and have been found to feed on Herbivore like {@creature Mosswine|MHMM} and {@creature Aptonoth|MHMM}. Astalos have also been observed eating Neopteron like {@creature Vespoid|MHMM} and lesser predators like {@creature Velocidrome|MHMM}. Despite being top predators, Astalos have to compete with other large predatory monsters like {@creature Rathalos|MHMM}, {@creature Najarala|MHMM}, {@creature Seregios|MHMM}, and {@creature Seltas Queen|MHMM}.",
							"Astalos's whole body is an electrical organ. Astalos uses Piezoelectricity - as an Astalos fights and becomes more active, Its tail, wings, and crest will begin to charge up with electricity. This can easily be seen by looking for green surges of electricity on those parts of its body. Astalos's flying abilities are comparable to a Rathalos with the help of its powerful wings. Its wings are tough, covered in spikes, and are even used as weapons on the ground. The wings can also produce a special electrical charge used for capturing prey. Its pincer-like tail is used for capturing and paralyzing prey.",
							"They've been seen attacking large Flying Wyverns, like Rathalos, even if those monsters are not interested in the Astalos's presence. Even if the enemy is losing the fight, Astalos will fight them relentlessly, even if they are trying to escape. If the enemy is killed, the Astalos may feed on the enemy's corpse, as it is sometimes known to do. Astalos will even sometimes cannibalize their own young by accident. This is due to the adults mistaking the young for Neopteron like Vespoid occasionally. To prevent this, Astalos guard their nest up until the eggs are ready to hatch before leaving the young to fend for themselves. Even while young, Astalos don't hesitate about anything, including cannibalism, and can be quite violent. When a town gets reports of this monster, they are known to send adventurers immediately to hunt it down. This is due to Astalos actually disrupting the ecological balance in an area.",

Its tail erects large spikes which can be flung and linked up with its attacks for devastating hits.

The scales at the end of the tail can also be shaken to produce rattling sounds similar to that of a rattle snake.",

The creature is almost as big as the recently discovered {@creature Xeno'jiiva|MHMM}, although it could move as fast as {@creature Nergigante|MHMM}. It also has powerful horns and claws that while seemingly have no special attribute to them, prove to be dangerous weapons when paired with their very muscular build. The combination of these physical traits allows Behemoth to pull quick and powerful attacks that cover a wide area in a continuous streak; one reason why fighting the monster alone is heavily advised against.",
					"The behemoth also has the ability to cast magical attacks that is rather unnatural even compared to Elder Dragons. While fellow Elder Dragons commonly generate, conduct or manipulate a specific substance or energy to produce powerful effects, Behemoth seemingly conjure natural disasters out of thin air: It can summon meteors, make whirlwind to appear in a specific spot, make lighting strikes and most infamously, summon a titanic mass of rock from the sky to easily destroy would be-opponents, a move called \"Ecliptic Meteor\". However the Ecliptic Meteor seems to be very self-destructive towards behemoth itself, as they can die from using it too often or in heavily wounded state.",
					"Another unique trait of behemoth is its ability to develop \"Enmity\" towards a foe, which basically makes behemoth more focused and determined in a fight. This will be indicated with the behemoth's eye turning red and the body gaining reddish hue. However, it is a double-edged sword as in this state, behemoth could not heed proper attention to multiple opponent, making it vulnerable to flanking attacks.",
					"The behemoth came from the entirely different world of Eorzea and thus does not consider any habitat charted by the Guild its home. The Elder's Recess of the New World is the only locale the monster was ever known to prowl, mostly because it is the site of its entry from the anomalous occurrence that brought some Eorzean creatures into the continent.",
					"In its home world, Behemoth is already considered a powerful creature, often requiring the effort of a dozen or more heroes with various unique and magical abilities to take down.",
					"When it arrived in the Elder's Recess, it easily asserted itself as an unrivaled invader that could easily kill lesser monsters like {@creature dodogama|MHMM} with no effort and deter those fortunate enough to flee. Apparently, even Elder Dragons like nergigante, {@creature teostra|MHMM}, and {@creature kushala daora|MHMM} are reluctant to be in the Elder's Recess during the beast's time there. Behemoth thus made itself a threat to all life in the New World, so much in fact that the Commission deemed made it a priority target. It is almost a mandate for any hunter not to tackle the creature alone, a degree of caution reserved by the Guild for very few creatures.",
					"Either shocked for being transported into a different world or because of its natural mentality, behemoth has no tolerance towards Hunters, and will show almost immediate aggression, possibly because the creature also bear terrible relations with humanoids back in its original world. Little else is known of the creature's behavior as there was but one case when it was witnessed to attack another monster in Recess, and it was left to be ambiguous if the attack was done out of predatory or territorial behavior.",

							"Brachydios are easily identifiable by their glowing, green slime-covered horns and \"fists,\" as well as their shiny, armored hide covered in many plates and ridges that are made of obsidian. Unlike other Brute Wyverns, Brachydios sports a pair of long, highly developed forelimbs that it uses as its primary means of defense. Brachydios' forelimbs and horn seem to secrete a mysterious slime.",
							"A Brachydios \"primes\" this mucus to explode with its saliva, hence why it licks its arms, making it appear brighter green. Despite initial appearances, Brachydios does possess claws on its forearms that are tucked away underneath, and serve no apparent purpose in battle.",
							"The symbiotic slime-mold is easily one of the most unique and defining feature of the Brachydios. The theropod's armored shell is hardened to protect against the explosive blasts that the mold creates on impact. A Brachydios's skin is similar to that of a thermos flask, giving it the ability to withstand both extreme heat and cold. Brachydios's body is the only place this mold can survive without turning explosive. When attacking, Brachydios constantly scrapes copious amounts of this mold off of its body, causing it to deplete. However, it seems that the beast's saliva acts as a powerful stimulant, which causes the mold to almost instantly replenish itself.",
							"Brachydios are extremely aggressive creatures and will not hesitate to attack if they feel threatened or challenged. Due to their aggression they are commonly known to invade the territories of other large predators, usurp them, and claim the territory as their own. They will also show no mercy to small monsters. Young Brachydios will live near their parents and their territory, yet the adults will not show any parental care at all. The young will pick up slime mold left behind by adults. However, this can be dangerous as their hides are underdeveloped and can possibly be seriously injured or even killed by the explosions of the slime mold.",

Ceadeus has a special relationship with an algae, which is the reason why it has its beard. It farms for the algae with its beard and uses the glow from the luminous bacteria as a form of photosynthesis.",
							"With this algae, Ceadeus can spend longer times under the depths without having to come up for air. When it needs air, it will swim up with a burst of speed and jump out of the water for a breath. It is estimated a Ceadeus can hold its breath for about several months. Ceadeus has powerful fins and a tail fin designed for swimming in the sea with both power and grace. The horns of a Ceadeus never stop growing, and at times, the Elder Dragon will grind them against the sea floor, with enough force to produce earthquakes and tsunamis.",
							"It is believed that this behavior resulted in the destruction of an island on at least one occasion. Throughout their years, Ceadeus are able to use an organ called the Luminous Organ. This organ is used to help farm the algae it uses to breath. The luminous bacteria on its body reacts to the organ by reflecting the light.",

To stay cool in the heat of the desert, its scales hold large amounts of moisture in its body, allowing for more activity in its environment. They can't breath in the sand so they have to occasionally jump out the sand in order to breath air. While swimming, however, they will swallow some of the sand as they swim. The swallowed sand is stored in a special organ in their body, that combines sand with its mucus, and saves this sand as a weapon to injure prey.",

							"Chameleos's body is covered by a purple and white hide, and its head ends with a protruding horn at the tip of its nose. Its eyes are similar to a real life chameleon's; large and orb-like, with the ability to control eye movement individually. The long and elastic tongue can extend to grasp and steal items from a distance. Its wings are a purple color with a grayish white membrane, and are used for flight and controlling the direction of its poison fog. Chameleos's large tail is reminiscent of a leaf and has a curled, spiraling tip.",
							"Chameleos are different from other Elder Dragons, as they are not nearly as \"elegant\" in their appearance as other Elder Dragon species. Chameleos have a number of biological adaptations that make them extremely unique. Most notably is the Chameleos's trademark camouflage mechanism. Each species of Chameleos has a different way of camouflaging itself. By generating a weak electric current in its skin that interacts with the mist it can breathe, the Elder Dragon can bend light around itself, rendering it effectively invisible. Some Chameleos use special ore to enable their camouflage. Chameleos have independently moving eyeballs that protrude from the sides of its head to create a wider field of vision. Chameleos have several nasty defenses should it ever come under attack. They possess an extremely strong poison, which can be released from its mouth at will and often whipped into a thick cloud by the dragon's wings. Some Chameleos also possess an extra vocal cord paralysis poison in their acid globs. Finally, it can exhale large amounts of mist to further hinder the vision of hunters, allowing it to either make a swift getaway or launch a surprise attack with ease.",
							"Chameleos are ambush hunters, waiting patiently for prey to pass by while they blend perfectly into their surroundings. Chameleos can and will eat almost anything, and can use different tactics to take down varying sizes of prey. Should its prey be a Neopteron such as a {@creature Vespoid|MHMM}, {@creature Altaroth|MHMM}, {@creature Bnahabra|MHMM}, or {@creature Konchu|MHMM} it will simply snatch it out of the air using its long sticky tongue. If it is a supply camp, it'll steal with each opportunity it gets.",
							"Chameleos are very intelligent creatures. They will wait patiently at a spot of importance such as a water source or natural crossroads, waiting for prey to pass by. Chameleos are well known for stealing items from adventurers. Chameleos do this in order for the adventurers to lose motivation in hunting them down.",

							"The chaotic gore magala is a rare special {@creature gore magala|MHMM} individual that has failed to molt properly into a {@creature shagaru magala|MHMM} and has only molted half way on one side of its body. This failure to molt has to do with molting in the vicinity of a shagaru magala's territory and effects from the shagaru magala's virus prevent the gore magala from molting properly. Just like gore magala, chaotic gore magala is in the unknown class.",

Despite their deadly strength and weaponry, these beasts must compete with other large predators. Even with this competition, chaotic gore magalas don't show any scars or injuries on their bodies and this is due to most predators tending to avoid these monsters at all costs. Those who encounter chaotic gore magala are killed on sight by it, showing how high it is in the food chain.",
							"The chaotic gore magala has many of the same adaptions as gore magala, however, has a few minor differences. On one side of its body, it has some traits from shagaru magala. It has partially developed scales on its wing, neck, and head that come from its adult form. The horn on its head isn't fully developed and has really no use, unlike a gore magala's antennae.",
							"One of the most disturbing traits is its \"eye\". This eye doesn't seem to have developed completely, meaning the eye could be useless to it. When in its Frenzy State, this eye can be seen glowing red though very rarely. Due to only one side partially developing, its strength is far greater than a normal individual.",
							"The chaotic gore magala is a lot more aggressive and a lot more violent than normal gore magala. This is due to their failed molting causing them constant pain. This has also changed their habits compared to a normal gore magala. It has even been found that the chaotic gore magala are slowly dying from the virus after failing to molt properly.",

							"Daimyo Hermitaur has a large, crab-like body. It is covered in a red and white carapace and wears the skull of a {@creature Monoblos|MHMM} as a protective shell. They have huge, thick claws capable of holding prey as well as shielding the giant crab from most any attacks. Daimyo Hermitaur's shell is also very tough, able to deflect the blows of most weapons. The one chink in the creature's armor is its soft hindquarters, where many of the creature's major organs are stored. To fix this problem, Daimyo Hermitaur will wear the skulls of dead wyverns on their backs. Acquiring the right size shell is a chore though, and occasionally Daimyo Hermitaur can be spotted with shells too large, or small for their bodies. Almost all of Daimyo Hermitaur's shells come from members of the larger species like Monoblos. Daimyo Hermitaur also possess surprisingly strong legs, able to move the creature with great speed if necessary. The legs assist the creature in digging holes and they are able to launch themselves many feet into the air, causing them to land vigorously on top of hunters who don't react fast enough.",
							"Some unusual rare Daimyo Hermitaur have a dark reddish color on their claws, darker legs and more shiny eyes. Along with this their shells are unusually covered in moss or algae. They also have the ability to spit long streams of water. They use new attack techniques as their claws are much stronger than average, they use their claws in a shielded position much like a human boxing while walking at a target, these claws are reported to be so strong in this position that ranged projectiles fired from guns ricochet, along with this new smarter advancing technique they perform a very aggressive non stop side to side claw snapping attack behavior that out-speeds most attackers.",
							"Despite their size, Daimyo Hermitaur are fairly calm, when undisturbed. However, Daimyo Hermitaur will turn aggressive if they feel threatened or attacked. Most of time, they can be seen foraging for food as they roam around their environment.",

							"Deviljho is a bipedal Brute Wyvern characterized by its uniform forest green colouration and muscular upper body. Its thick hide is littered with short, jagged spines that reach a maximum height along the back and tail. Deviljho has a narrow snout with a large lower jaw, covered in multiple rows of teeth spreading outwards from the mouth. It has massive, powerful hind legs, but tiny, poorly developed forelegs that it rarely utilizes. Their eyes are small and simple, suggesting their vision is rather poor, but their other senses such as smell may compensate for this. Their tails are long and powerful, but their main feature of note is its breath attack. When provoked, Deviljho's back and shoulder muscles swell considerably. During this period, areas of its skin will take on a bright red colouration.",
							"Deviljho is a nomadic monster, prone to wandering vast distances in search of prey. Its status as a super-predator allows it to overtake the territory of any monster that stands in its path. Because of the extreme amount of energy its body consumes, Deviljho is always in search of food sources. It is known to be cannibalistic, and is also prone to eating prey alive in order to waste as little time as possible in replenishing its energy.",

In addition, they are capable of producing a powerful roar that will stun most aggressors. Using their powerful legs in tandem with their heavy upper body and head, Diablos can run at high speeds to charge attackers with their horns, using the powerful momentum to maximize the potential for damage.",
							"Diablos are herbivores, known to feed on the plentiful cacti of the desert. Despite this however, they are wildly aggressive and will pursue anything which enters their territory. Diablos are known to use their horns as weapons against attackers, but will also use them in bouts against other Diablos in battles for territory or mating rights. Diablos typically avoid flight for the purpose of transportation, as a disproportionally high mass prevents them from effectively flying for long periods of time. Instead, Diablos will use their wings to free themselves when trapped in the sand.",

					"Dire Miralis is a very large, semi-aquatic Elder Dragon. Its body structure is reminiscent of {@creature Fatalis|MHMM}, with relatively short limbs and a long tail and neck.

On its back are a pair of wing-like appendages. Seemingly useless in terms of flight, these \"wings\" feature cannon-like chutes which can extrude globules of magma, both as a means of defense and as a way to jettison excess magma. Dire Miralis's head features a frill-like structure and an upturned snout.",

A Dire Miralis actually destroyed the Tainted Sea and killed all living things in the area, filling the water with blood, until it was driven off in ancient times. This monster is one that many hunters don't live to tell about.",

							"Duramboros is a bulky, heavyset, bovine monster with stocky, muscular legs and a thick upper body. It features a very thick outer hide that is riddled with heavy folds, with a row of armored plates running along its back and tail. Duramboros' most distinctive features include its massive tail club, twin brow horns, and a pair of energy-rich dorsal humps. Duramboros' slow lifestyle often results in a layer of moss and algae growing upon its hide, most noticeably along the back.",
							"Duramboros is a herbivore, subsisting primarily on fallen tree trunks. Using its ram-like pair of horns, as well its hammer-like tail club, it is known to push or knock down weak or dead trees in order to comfortably feed on them. Though generally docile, Duramboros has a capacity for aggression if provoked. It is known to use its tail club, horns, and overall mass to attack foes. One of its most unique tendencies is to twirl in place, using its tail club as a counter-balance to build up momentum, allowing it to hurl itself at an attacker and crush them with its body.",
							"Due to its diet, Duramboros is most commonly encountered in highly forested areas.",

							"In legend, it is said that all living things fear Fatalis, including other Elder Dragons, such as {@creature Teostra|MHMM} and {@creature Lao-Shan Lung|MHMM}. All monsters are said to try to avoid Fatalis at all costs, leading to some leaving areas altogether simply to avoid it.",
							"The Fatalis is a powerful, unnatural beast. The Fatalis's scales are extremely thick, while its shell is very durable. This is due to Fatalis melting the armor of its fallen prey on its shell, increasing its protection against some attacks. Fatalis doesn't seem to have very good eyesight, though this maybe partially be due to what its eyes are made of. Creepily, a Fatalis's eyes are made out of crystals. How is unknown. Fatalis's wing membrane is flexible, but as hard as metal. From this, Fatalis's wings don't break very easily, allowing it to fly at high speeds and support itself as it becomes airborne. Even on the ground, Fatalis is able to walk on all fours and rush prey at shocking speeds with sheer power behind its bulk. The most powerful feature is its powerful fiery breath. This fire is some of the strongest fire breath out of all monsters and can kill most enemies almost instantly. Recent encounters have revealed that Fatalis possess control over fire on par with Teostra and {@creature Lunastra|MHMM}. Its fire breath extends well beyond the length and height of the already large dragon.",
							"In some legends about the Fatalis, there is a legend known by some as the shifting scales of fate. This legend claims that the Second Coming of Fatalis is infinite. The Fatalis in this legend is quite different from the Fatalis seen in the other legends. This Fatalis is described to have six horns, a glowing blue chest, a short mane in between its spikes, bizarre fluids flowing through out its body, and the ability to shift its scales from black, red, or white. Each set of scales is said to grant the fatalis different abilities and protection. The most well known of these skills are the Black Flame and Crimson Demons breath that are said to combine the elements Fire and Death together, Despite both being combined together with the same elements, Each breath has a different element that seems to overtake this Fatalis's body, allowing it to do things not seen in other legends. This Fatalis is said to be able to send monsters running with a single flap of its wings.",
							"A creepy light coming from its eyes invites those it stares at into its dark depths. The fluids are said to have no exact weight. Its shell is impervious to strikes from weapons and has terrifying power inside of it, which could be unleashed at anytime. The scariest part about this legend is that not only is its strength far beyond the ones from the other legends, but its body shows signs of possible regenerative powers. This means that this Fatalis maybe able to regenerate after taking large amounts of damage, just like Dire Miralis can regenerate from its still beating heart. Thankfully, this legend hasn't been proven as of yet so the Guild has nothing to worry about.",
							"One thing that all the legends share about Fatalis is its equipment. This equipment is much more than what it appears to be. When adventurers wear this monster's armor, they are known to disappear mysteriously without a trace or even die if the armor is worn for too long. Some who have worn the Fatalis's armor report having terrible nightmares, unsettling strength, and a feeling as if they were being possessed by something. They also report feeling a familiar pulse coming from the armor, a feeling as if their legs were taken from them. With some adventurers wearing the armor of the Black Flame, they report feeling as if their body was taken over while they were unconscious. It is said that this equipment might be alive, meaning that Fatalis might not truly be dead. In Pokke Village, a giant black blade embedded in the ice is known to regenerate days after being mined once, which supports this claim that Fatalis is still alive. Other Fatalis weapons also seem to suggest that Fatalis is still alive in some form. Some weapons despair eat at the user's hands while other weapons, when held, have hideous abyssal screams coming from them. Some weapons even have a thirst for blood. From this, it is said that it's best to not to use any equipment from Fatalis in any form at all.",
							"Fatalis is extremely hostile to all living things. It threatens the very existence of not only the Castle Schrade, but the very world around it. In legend, it is said Fatalis could scorch the whole world with its flames in a few days, burning all lands to a crisp. Due to this, the Guild will secretly send adventurers to hunt it down to prevent public panic. However, most adventurers never return. Due to many incidents surrounding Schrade Kingdom and Fatalis, the Adventurer's Guild has classified everything about both away from the public. Fatalis's armor and quest are only allowed to those that have proven they are quite credible.",

							"The flaming espinas has all the adaptations of its green counterpart, though a few key differences. It gets the title, Brown Thorn Wyvern, from its color. Unlike its cousin's poisons, the poison produced by flaming espinas is much deadlier from its acidic nature, thanks to the sulfur found in its body mixed into the poison. The acid that flaming espinas produces is said to corrode armor in a single touch. The thorns on it, wither all plants it touches. Two sticks from these thorns and prey will never wake up again! This poison can kill up to a thousand velociprey in near minutes! Or so I have heard. The biggest difference that flaming espinas has is its ability to charge up its attacks. By charging up its attacks, it is able to kill prey with a single powerful blow.",
							"Similarly to the common {@creature espinas|MHMM}, it is a docile and passive wyvern which will only attack when provoked. It sleeps for much of the day, and is usually encountered in this state. The flaming espinas is known to inhabit the Tower and Forlorn Arena, where it resides in solitude at the very top. In addition, it can be found in gorges, ancient ruins, and in great forests.",

							"Gaismagorm is a massive Elder Dragon similar in size and structure to {@creature Gogmazios|MHMM}, though seemingly with a more pseudowyvern-like gait. Its back legs appear to be vestigial, as they drag along as it crawls along using its front legs and massive forearms, which appear to have been adapted from its wings like those of {@creature Gore Magala|MHMM} and {@creature Shagaru Magala|MHMM}. These forearms are incredibly dexterous, allowing it to easily climb vertical surfaces and even grip and toss objects at opponents.",
							"Gaismagorm has a stout, angular head compared to its body with two horns and a mouth that functions as a unique sort of \"split mouth\" with four folding segments that come out from the jaw. The bottom two of which, possess two hooks that assist it when scooping up large amounts of matter that it either scoops out of the ground, or forces towards its mouth.",
							"In addition, Gaismagorm has a barbed tongue, thick ridged plating covering its body with large central spikes around the shoulder region, and vents lining the surface of the body that it uses to expel energy absorbed from the {@creature Qurio|MHMM}, seen as \"flames\" which it uses to enhance its attacks and propel itself forwards. The Qurio themselves are violently protective of their host and swarm around it at all times.",
							"Gaismagorm is the true host of the Qurio, and much like {@creature Malzeno|MHMM}, it shares a symbiotic relationship with them, and feeds on the life force they steal from their vctims for energy. It can manipulate the Qurio into doing a variety of attack and skills, such as creating crystal armor for defense and beam attacks. It has a vacuum breath which allows it to draw in foes before hitting them or absorb more Qurio to power itself up.",
							"Gaismagorm can further use the energy gained by the Qurio to launch explosive fireball attacks from its mouth or any of the vents lining its arms, propel itself forwards in a similar fashion to Magnamalo, fire beams that infuse into the ground to make aftershocks, imbue its physical attacks with explosive aftershocks, and finally shoot it up into the air to cause a field wide effect where chunks of explosive red crystal drop from the sky.",
							"Gaismagorm is also durable enough that even when impaled by three {@object Dragonator|AGMH}s, which the last one being explosive, it can still fight the hunter(s) with no sign of injury at all, and can even take two more during that fight.",
							"Much of its time is spent dormant in a nest it creates underground to rest. After around 50 years has passed, it then creates a giant hole from its lair to the surface for the Qurio to emerge from so they can feed on the local monster populations. Gaismagorm then waits underground until the Qurio return with life energy from the surface in order to absorb it. Once it has enough energy, however, it will surface from its nest. It is known to be bitter rivals with Malzeno, the latter of which has kept it underground for decades, if not centuries by preventing it from obtaining enough energy to surface through the use of hijacking the Qurio it uses to feed. Gaismagorm is an aggressive and gluttonous Elder Dragon that desires to consume all forms of life in order to become stronger. This demonic looking monster was responsible for the near destruction of the Kingdom in the past.",

							"Gammoth resembles a woolly mammoth. It is by far the largest Fanged Beast known to date. The fur covering its huge body is mostly bluish, although it's also white and red on its trunk, legs, back and underside. It has brown plating covering most of its head and feet, as well as two tusks seemingly made of the same material. This plating is said to be extremely resistant to damage. Its trunk is strong and used for picking up objects like certain foods. However, Gammoth have been seen violently grabbing smaller monsters and slamming them down on the ground if they threatened it. Its trunk is estimated to be strong enough to lift up large Flying Wyverns. The trunk is also used to protect itself or even to coat its legs.",
							"Gammoth are a highly territorial species. If a Gammoth finds a predator in its territory, it is known to kill the predator instantly with one powerful blow. Though adult Gammoth are giants with no major predators, young Gammoth are potential prey for many predators. From this young Gammoth are snowy white in color, allowing them to camouflage themselves in snowy environments.",
							"When Gammoth have {@creature young gammoth|MHMM|young} with them, they are known to live in harmony with herds of {@creature Popo|MHMM} until their young are large enough to protect themselves. While in the herd of Popo, Gammoth act as guards for not just their young but for the whole Popo herd against predators. While young, {@creature Tigrex|MHMM} is the most major predator for Gammoth, and the one that they most fear, but as the young Gammoth reaches adulthood, that fear is replaced with aggression and rage towards Tigrex. A Gammoth is territorial and a mother Gammoth is protective, while a starving Gammoth is extremely violent. A starving Gammoth is known to attack just about anything, even going as far as eating wood off homes to satisfy its own hunger.",

Also, Gigginox does not have highly moisturized skin, and unlike the Khezu, it does not have visible veins.

While the Khezu primarily uses its developed hind legs to leap around or to the ceilings of caves, Gigginox will use all four limbs plus its tail to propel itself, suggesting that the Gigginox's limbs aren't as well developed as the Khezu. Gigginox have a circular, leech-like maw, which contains many sharp teeth.",

Their top skin is grey-white, and their under-skin is dark red. Gigginox have a circular, leech-like maw, which contains many sharp teeth. They can spit poison or release it as a form of gas from pores under their body. Gigginox can lay gelatinous globs, called Giggi Sacs, that spawn young Giggi.",

During the day, they sleep much longer than most other monsters in the area but at night they become truly active. They will spend sometime awake during the day but if they instantly sense potential prey in the area, they will actively stalk the creature in the caves. Said prey items are later left behind as corpses in caves to make it easier to catch prey. Despite a Gigginox's looks, they are considered to be quite intelligent compared to some other Flying Wyverns. Gigginox even save food in their caves.",

							"Glavenus is a large Brute Wyvern with dark red scales covering its body. Two rows of blue, bony plates run along its back, going from the eyes to the tail. Its underside is more of a cream color. The main feature of Glavenus's physiology is its huge, sword-like tail. The tail has originally the same color as its back plates, although it will turn a rusty color or a fiery red during the battle. Its hind legs are powerful and muscular, while its front legs are much smaller and mostly useless. The face and mandibles are covered in sturdy plating, particularly resembling a Carnotaurus ' head.",
							"Glavenus's most striking feature is its blade-like tail. The blade-like tail is used in many ways by Glavenus such as keeping the body balanced but its primary use is for attacking. This tail can cut prey in two with a single slash, crack the ground easily, and even block some attacks. Though its tail is already a powerful weapon, it can become more dangerous once heated up. By grinding its tail on the ground or nearby hard surfaces violently, it can ignite the tail, heating it up to high temperatures. While its tail is heated all of its tail-based attacks become more deadly, also allowing it to cut through objects much more easily.",
							"Glavenus are relentless and aggressive predators. Glavenus oftens drags its tail across the ground and roars at the foe. This shows the enemy that it uses fire as a weapon in an attempt to scare them off. Not only are they considered one of the strongest Brute Wyverns, they are even believed to be the smartest ones around. Their territory is commonly marked by large gashes on the ground, produced when they scrape their tails along solid objects.",

							"Gobul is a uniquely evolved Leviathan reminiscent of angler and puffer fish. Its body is covered in purple scales, and a bright, bio-luminescent lure dangles from its forehead. It possesses a gargantuan mouth filled with equally formidable teeth. Its back features an array of retractable spines, and its tail is tipped with quills containing powerful neurotoxins, which can paralyze both predator and prey. The Gobul doesn't produce these toxins, but receives them through its food. The neurotoxin exists in the ecosystem in small quantities and gets concentrated to the top of the food chain. Gobul uses this toxin mainly for self-defense, but they will sometimes use it to paralyze its prey during mimicry.",
							"Gobul's massive mouth and throat mean that it can swallow prey almost as large as itself completely whole. Its lure can violently emit blinding flashes of light to disorient prey to make for an easy meal. Luminescent micro-organisms are cultured in Gobul's lantern sphere, and are stimulated by shaking. It could be said that the microbial organisms that are emitting the intense light have a symbiotic relationship with the Gobul. Another theory suggests that by shaking its lantern, Gobul secretes a substance that causes a chemical reaction with the microbes to cause the flash.",
							"It is capable of puffing out its body like a balloon to appear more imposing.",
							"Gobul has a display of whiskers on its chin, mimicking air weeds. It leaves these whiskers to flow in the water to both hide itself and draw prey in. This natural camouflage ability is enhanced further by Gobul's ability to change the color of its skin, like a chameleon allowing it to blend into the river floor and remain undetected by prey.",
							"Gobul isn't particularly aggressive, preferring to hide in the sediment at the bottom of the river. However, when drawn from its hiding place by hunger or agitated, it shows a surprising ability to fend off foes, outmaneuvering them in the water and sucking them into its mouth. It will even attempt to fight predators on land, where it is at a disadvantage, before retreating back to the water. It seems to be enemies with {@creature Royal Ludroth|MHMM}, for hunters have seen the two attack each other for territory and/or food.",
							"Despite the Guild knowing about {@creature gobling|MHMM|young Gobuls}, they know very little about the adults. Gobul found at sea have been found to have developed eggs within there body, and it is believed that they swim out to sea to breed. However, it is only a theory as no fully developed adults have been discovered. It is believed that the adults are either hidden mimicking the sea bottom or have a completely different appearance.",

When it uses its Oil laser attack, a glowing pattern, reminiscent of a scowl, is present beneath its chin, giving it the semblance of a second face. Its wingarms feature membranes that almost completely retract when not in use, and its body is covered in thick, powerful scales, carapaces, and spines of an indigo colouration. Perhaps the most notable features of Gogmazios's body are the ever-present covering of a sticky, tar-like substance which it uses to incapacitate prey. It is unknown where Gogmazios exactly lives but it is theorized by scholars that it comes from swamps along with some mountainous habitats.",
							"Despite Gogmazios's habitat being unknown, Gogmazios are known to feed sulfur, which can be found in gunpowder and explosives. This was discovered after one raided Dundroma's Weapon Warehouse for many years and was seen feeding on the explosives. From this it can be assumed that Gogmazios may also feed on ore though Gogmazios hasn't been seen interacting with other monsters so this is just a hypothesis by scholars. Gogmazios aren't the most aggressive Elder Dragons, but certainly aren't harmless and will attack if threatened. Gogmazios are known to hibernate underground for a very long period of time, spanning to a few years or even several decades, when it has obtained enough food, but waking up to feed again when food is needed.",
							"Unlike most other Elder Dragons, Gogmazios has an extra pair of limbs that allow it to walk better and allow it to walk upright. From the large amounts of muscles found inside these limbs, Gogmazios is able to walk upright with very much ease and to battle some threats at close range. These extra pair of limbs even allow Gogmazios to fly with its powerful wings. The wings of Gogmazios aren't tattered. The oil on its body has actually stuck the wings to its arms due to it hardening. When greatly angered, the heat will cause the oil to evaporate from its wings and Gogmazios forces itself in the air to fly. Gogmazios don't fly easily and rarely ever fly. Gogmazios has oil circulating throughout its body, while some of the oil pours out of its body. The oil coming out of a Gogmazios is impurities, such as waste or sweat, from its skin due to its diet. The oil pours out from its chest and back, dripping onto the ground below it. This oil is very sticky, attaching to anything that it touches. Inside some of the oil is objects that were picked up by Gogmazios accidentally. These objects can be weapons, artifacts, arrows, and living organisms. Some of the oil has hardened on Gogmazios's body, increasing the strength of its scales and shell, giving it better defense against potential threats. Also, found inside of its body and inside its extra limbs are special organs that allow it to produce heated fire. Gogmazios uses this fire as a tool to ignite the oil and to make its attacks deadlier then before. When greatly enraged, Gogmazios's body temperature will increase greatly, making the oil it produces ignite faster and heat up faster without much warning.",

							"Gore Magala is unlike anything anyone has ever seen before. In light of the discovery that it is the juvenile form of the {@creature Shagaru Magala|MHMM}, some scholars have proposed that it be classified as an Elder Dragon, but until a consensus is reached it has been given the placeholder classification of Unknown.",
							"Gore Magala is a very unique wyvern, sharing traits and similarities to that of the Elder Dragons, possessing six limbs, including the clawed wings on its back. Though, its overall appearance and stance resembles a quadrupedal wyvern like the {@creature Nargacuga|MHMM}. Its body is covered in dark exoskeleton plates, with notable features including the hidden feelers that are folded alongside its face, the lack of visible eyes and fanged jaws that are actually parts of its external armor plates. The other unique part is its wings, which are covered in jet-black fur that resemble a tattered and ragged cape. The claws on its wings are extremely prehensile, and even seem to possess opposable thumbs. They are used for grabbing, help at running and maintaining stability. When not engaged in combat, Gore Magala tends to cloak its body with its wings by latching them onto its back.",
							"Gore Magala has an unusually high metabolism but rarely feeds on much prey. Due to this metabolism, its hairs on its wings are constantly left behind and flying in the air. These hairs are used to understand their environment and leave behind a trail that Gore Magala uses to see both predators and prey by heat. Once it smells something in the area, it will begin to spread around its hairs around the area in order to find the target and these hairs will attach onto the target, allowing the Gore Magala to see them with heat. As Gore Magala's senses increase and become better from these hairs, its color under its wings will slowly change and get brighter. When its sense are at their highest peak, two antennae will appear from its head and it will release a large amounts of hairs into the air. The hairs in the sky will darken the sky as if an eclipse was in the area and it will begin to walk on all six. This is its Frenzy State. When it enters this state, it will begin to use its wing claws to allow it to walk and attack better using them. These claws can leave deep gouges in prey that are said to never heal.",
							"Gore Magala's most infamous feature is the {@disease Frenzy Virus|MHMM}. This virus is spread from Gore Magala's scales and hairs while its breath has similar properties to them. When in its Frenzy State, Gore Magala is able to make explosions in the area by combining the hairs in the atmosphere around it with a spark from its mouth. The Frenzy Virus causes some abnormalities in the nervous system, increased physical strength, and a decrease in the body's resistance. This virus makes all monsters extremely violent and eventually kills most of them. Some may overcome the effects of the Frenzy Virus and actually develop a relationship with it, becoming physically stronger from the virus while also spreading the virus like Gore Magala in order to get rid of competition from their own species. These rare individuals are known as Apex Monsters.",
							"Gore Magalas are highly aggressive, elusive monsters. These monsters show great amounts of aggression and have shown great amounts of intelligence. Some have even been shown to play dead before slipping away when given an opportunity too. Despite competing with other powerful predators, Gore Magalas have rarely been seen with any wounds or scars on their body. Though these monsters are aggressive, they are more aggressive when its time for them to return to the Heaven's Mount and go to the Sanctuary. The reason for this is for the Gore Magala to molt into a legendary Shagaru Magala that once nearly wiped out every living thing in the mountains.",
							"Interestingly, Gore Magala have been known to attack seafaring ships during their voyages across the great seas.",

					"{@creature Nerscylla|MHMM} physically resembles a real life Arachnid, but is much larger in size.

In addition, it possesses a massive pair of retractable jaws which can inflict a poisonous bite. It can produce a strong, sticky webbing that it uses to trap prey and build nests. Its long, strong legs allow it to move at fast speeds, even sideways. At the tip of its abdomen is a large stinger it may use to attack. Sharp, poisonous spikes protrude from its back.",
					"These large Temnocerans are ambush predators that will readily attack from behind, below, and above. When making a web they'll wisely construct it in an area where potential prey is most likely to appear. They are most commonly seen to construct their webs near farming settlements where they will attack and kill any livestock that wander into the vicinity of their web for food. Occasionally, they will even snatch away any unwary villagers/farmers that wander into their territory. As stated earlier {@creature Gypceros|MHMM} are the favorite prey of the Nerscylla but the food isn't the only reason why the Bird Wyvern is targeted. When killing a Gypceros the large arachnid not only eats it but disturbingly rips the skin off the avian Wyvern's body and wears it's skin as a cloak. This shocking behavior is both horrifying and intriguing to naturalists. The reason why Nerscylla do this is to increase their strength, use as camouflage, and for protection.",

Though Jhen Mohran feeds on the nutrients found within the sand, it will expel the unnecessary materials outside of its body with the help of multiple blowholes. The expelled sand alone can cause a change in flow to the quicksand in the Great Desert. Occasionally, seasonal winds can catch the expelled sands and blow the sands in the direction of settlements, causing massive sandstorms. Jhen Mohran has powerful lungs that helps it hold its breath for long periods of time. Some older Jhen Mohran can even use their lungs to fire a destructive beam of sand at foes. If sand wasn't covering Jhen Mohran than it would be a beautiful blue color. By spending long periods in the sand, the ore has formed from be polished by the sands.",

Jyuratodus's scales are vulnerable to extreme heat, becoming brittle and weak when left to dry. If jyratodus becomes too hot, it'll have a hard time breathing through its skin as well. To stay moist and keep cool, jyuraydous is always covering its body in mud to protect itself from the harsh sun, which is the main reason why it lives in swampy environments. Adorning its body are many fins that are primarily used for balance. Although these appendages assist it as it swims, jyuratodus will turn and adjust them while walking on land, aiding it as it moves over the uneven ground. Inside of its mouth are bone-crunching teeth used for crushing and tearing into prey. Once it has slain its victim, it'll feed the internal organs of its quarry. While swimming, jyuratodus will swallow some mud and combine it with water from its water sac, making thick globs of mud that restrict the movements of predators and prey alike.",
							"Jyuratodus are highly territorial, attacking all monsters that invade its turf. It spends most of its time hidden away in its swamp, soaking in mud to stay moist, before hunting later in the day. While in its territory, it'll leave behind tracks in the water and on rocks as a warning to intruders, as well as kick up mud to scare off rivals. {@creature Barroth|MHMM} will unintentionally destroy these perimeters as it moves through the marsh, causing jyuratodus to attack the Brute Wyvern because it sees that as a challenge for its turf.",
							"Jyuratodus only ever breed during the wet season in the Wildspire Waste. Males and females will gather together in the swamps to spawn, but only a handful of their eggs will hatch. By the time the wet season is over, most of the water will have evaporated in the swamp, drying out the eggs. Once the young hatch, they'll search for a large monster and enter into the body of the organism by swimming into an opening (Wound, nostrils, mouth, etc.) before attaching their spine-like gills to its insides. The young jyuratodus will sneak into the bodies of larger creatures and feed on their insides until they get older.",

							"Khezu are large, pale Wyverns with a flabby, rubbery hide which they constantly keep damp, similar to that of an amphibian. Many of their blood vessels and veins can be seen through their pale skin. Their tail features a specialized orifice which bonds to the ground during electrical attacks and helps them cling onto cave ceilings. Their mouth features rows of sharp teeth. Khezu feet lack claws, and instead have suction pad-like toes to assist them in climbing and hanging from cave walls and ceilings. Spending most of their lives in the dark, their eyes have regressed greatly, though they make up for this with a superb sense of smell. A layer of fat helps to keep them warm and prolong the time they can spend hunting for food. Khezu have an extendable neck which allows them to grasp and ambush prey from afar, such as from a cave ceiling. Khezu are hermaphrodites, which means an individual is both male and female. To reproduce they paralyze a creature and inject their young, known as {@creature khezu whelp|AGMH|Whelps}. The Whelps grow inside their victim until it dies, or when they are strong enough to leave.",
							"Although Khezu are cave dwellers, they go out when they please, or when food inside grows too scarce. While Khezu outside a cave are vulnerable to larger Wyverns like {@creature Tigrex|MHMM}, inside caves Khezu have the advantage. In addition to being unhampered by the dark, they can cling to the ceiling and attack from above.",
							"A Khezu's habitat is often located near active sources of water; some sources claim this is because the water is excellent for conducting electricity into their prey, while others speculate that Khezu may need the dampness for their moist skin.

Variations of Konchu can have different colors depending on their environment, which they use as a form of camouflage to protect themselves from possible predators.",

Konchu will swarm around kills but they will wait until the predator is finished with that kill before feeding on the leftovers. When threatened, Konchu will attempt to frighten their attacker away by raising themselves on to their back feet and waving their fan-like pincers. If this does not work, they will proceed to launch themselves at their attacker in an attempt to tackle them. Oddly enough, some hunters have witnessed Konchu crawling on to the bodies of larger monsters and remaining there. This strange phenomenon seems to act as a natural form of armor for the large monsters on which the Konchu place themselves, making it difficult for hunters to damage the monster while it is covered in Konchu and their strong shells. It is uncertain whether this behavior is a sign of some sort of symbiotic relationship between Konchu and other monsters or not.",

However considering her size, power, and speed it would be safe to assume she would be the top of the food chain along with most elder dragons. Curiously she seems to be utterly safe from the rabid hunger of the infamous {@creature Nergigante|MHMM}.",

Kulve Taroth once spotted will do all it can to escape conflict forcing hunters to retrack it again. Kulve Taroth has some displays of intelligence particularly when driven to a corner when she uses her breath to heat the ceilinig of caves to off-balance hunters.",
							"The most striking trait of the Kulve is the metal coat which it wears like a royal robe fit for a queen. Kulve's body is covered by the same materials that make up its coat, which all shine a bright golden glow but is not gold itself. Another striking trait is Kulve's size, she is massive far larger than most elder dragons and is strong enough to carry her massive metal coat. Her horns are rather unique in that they must be broken twice the first time to get rid of the coating and the final time to remove the horns themselves. When removed of the coating they are a dazzling color of sapphire and emeralds. Kulve uses both her massive body and her coat as both a means of defense and attack, often diving down to ram her body against hunters while her coat allows her to attack in ranges she wouldn't normally be able to attack.",
							"It's not until one removes her metal coat that we see the Kulve Taroth's true prowess, not only does she move much more nimbly but also more aggressively as well, using her horned head to ram and smash hunters with extreme agression. She also uses her breath more offensively heating up the floor and the ceiling to herd hunters into tight spaces to better smash them while they try to break her horns.",

							"Kushala Daora is a four legged Elder Dragon with a pair of widely spreading wings. Its skin is plated with metal that makes weapons bounce off without enough sharpness. Kushala Daora has numerous horns lining its head and sharp claws on each of its legs. Kushala Daora have the ability to manipulate strong winds, creating a wind barrier that surrounds itself. The wind barrier can knock a adventurer back, making the adventurer vulnerable to Kushala Daora's attacks. The wind barrier also makes it difficult for the adventurer to attack its body.",
							"Kushala Daora are rare top predators, and fear almost nothing. However, it is occasionally threatened by the large, fast and aggressive {@creature Tigrex|MHMM} and the rare powerful {@creature Rajang|MHMM}. They can compete with other elder dragons, especially {@creature Chameleos|MHMM} in the Jungle. There are reports of Kushala Daora eating mineral deposits, this may show how they manage to have a metal rust-able skin. Kushala Daora possesses some of the largest wings of any monster. It uses these to sail effortlessly in the air. It can hover off the ground and blast hunters with wind.",
							"It uses a special organ to produce its famous wind based-attacks and abilities. When hit with poison, its organ will be weak and its shield will disappear for a short period of time while fighting the toxins. Kushala Daora have tough, metal filled skin, but suffer from a severe weakness to poison, which can easily enter the bloodstream through cracks created in the skin. Kushala Daora must infrequently shed their trademark skin as they grow. This can easily be spotted as the once shining silver scales will rust over due to oxidation with air. The most well-known ability about Kushala Daora is the storms it summons. These storms can easily destroy whole regions, varying from region to region. Kushala Daora can cause sandstorms, hurricanes, and snowstorms though it is unknown how.",
							"Some extra rare individuals have increased storm and wind-creating abilities. Such as creating multiple free-roaming tornados and wind tunnels under multiple targets all at once using its wings to control the wind flow, they are able to blow a breath that is both extremely strong and cold to the point of freezing the ground and water it has breathed on.",

Its able to release this electricity by contracting its cells at high speeds inside its muscles. When it does this some of the electricity actually combines with some of the mucus in its mouth, allowing it to spit out lightning projectiles from its mouth.

Lao-Shan Lungs are very well armored, although their bellies are vulnerable, as are their heads. Their shells only thicken as the time passes by. A Lao-Shan Lung shell coloration is determined by the kind of mineral particles that float in the atmosphere and get attached to its body as the dragon ages: the ones who dwell in the mountains are colored red because of the abundance of iron particles, while the ones that live near the Volcanic Belt are mostly grey due to ash. Like most dragons, their roar is very loud and can affect adventurers a good distance away. Because of their size, getting stepped on or whipped by the tail is very damaging or possibly fatal.",

Legiana's head is topped with a pair of antenna-like fins which are attached via a thin membrane to the back of its neck. It has bright yellow eyes and powerful legs ending in piercing talons. Its face, tail, feet, and wingtips are a dark navy blue, and its body is covered in striped patterns of the same colour. The ends of its wings are separated into four distinct flaps which overlap each other when folded. Legiana has star-like shapes on the back of its wings. Its back is also dark blue.",

It flies with extreme precision and agility, using its talons to grab its prey straight out of the air. Its legs are strong enough to throw even medium-sized monsters such as {@creature Paolumu|MHMM} considerable distances once they are in its grasp.",

This unusual adaptation is caused by its dapples, which reflect the light around itself. Although usable at anytime, this powerful ability is at its strongest when the moon is at its brightest. This adaptation can greatly assist these nargacuga in hunting their prey and avoid being seen by rival predators such as silver rathalos from above. This may also have contributed to them not being discovered until recently.",
							"Another adaptation that separates this nargacuga from its relatives are its tail spikes, which contain a powerful toxin capable of making a rathalos woozy and killing a hunter in a matter of moments. Interestingly, the wyverns appear to produce these toxins in their tail but how is a mystery. The jaws of the Lucent Nargacuga are the strongest of the three nargacuga species and are capable of biting through the toughest of armors. Its razors (the blades on its arms) are as well much tougher and, unsurprisingly sharper than its counterparts.",

Both the forelegs and hindlegs end in four-clawed digits, and each foreleg is armed with a single large serrated blade, which is kept folded back, parallel with the leg. Magnamalo's tail ends in a spear-like tip composed of three spikes that can flex outwards to form a trident shape. Hidden within its back are a series of bone blades/spikes that spring out from its hide whenever it becomes enraged.",

							"The magnamalo uses its thin, sharp tail for several attacks as well, such as somersaulting while using the blades of its tail-tip to strike like a whip. All of its yellow carapaces are also capable of erecting. It can also release thick purple clouds of gas that detonate when Magnamalo flicks its tail into them.",
							"Magnamalo is belligerent, and is extremely hostile towards monsters and hunters alike. It is shown multiple times attacking smaller monsters, such as {@creature Tobi-Kadachi|MHMM} or {@creature Arzuros|MHMM}, and carrying them in its jaws. In one instance, during a clash with {@creature Rathalos|MHMM}, when the Flying Wyvern tried to flee, Magnamalo quickly pounced onto its back. After some struggling, Magnamalo forced the both of them into a dive, sending itself and Rathalos crashing into the present Hunter in a fiery explosion. The battered Rathalos was blasted aside, with Magnamalo seemingly unharmed. The Magnamalo is powerful enough to go toe to toe with Elder Dragons such as the {@creature Teostra|MHMM}.",
							"Magnamalo shows every 50 years in Kamura Village during the Rampage in order to feast on the many monsters that show up. Feeding on the monsters helps the Wyvern become stronger. It is highly feared by the village as Magnamalo almost destroyed said village 50 years ago.",

There is also a pair of smaller fins, similar in coloration to the wings at the base of its tail. Three of the fingers on its front legs end in a curved, giant claw.

							"Like most other Leviathans, Mizutsune has a long, slender body. However, it is one of the few Leviathans to actually have fur on its body. This fur covers its chest, underbelly, legs and tail. Its scales are light colored and resemble those of a fish. Its head has a long snout and is beautifully adorned by many fin-like appendages. These fins are pink with yellow markings, and they can also be seen on its back and tail. Its feet are said to be quite different from other Leviathans and allow Mizutsune to move swiftly on land.",
							"Mizutsune's most unique adaption is its ability to produce bubbles. It is able to produce the bubbles by using special fluid secretions, produced from its own body along with water, and rubbing its hairs in the secretions. These stiff yet soft purple hairs are found on its chest, tail, legs, and sides. The hairs are used for sliding on the fluids it produces, spreading the fluids, and even using the fluids to produce more bubbles. Mizutsune can also breath these bubbly fluids from its mouth. It is known to use the bubbles it produces both offensively and defensively in battle. It uses the bubbles to help it move faster and to make it more flexible in battle, while simultaneously impeding the movement of any foes. In order to stop itself quickly while moving, Mizutsune has special hook-like claws that allow it to stop sliding quickly to face threats and not leave itself open. Despite Mizutsune's strange appearance, the fins it has actually act as receptors for detecting the presence of predators and prey coming through vibrations in the secretions. Like a snake, Mizutsune's teeth are recurved to prevent prey from escaping easily. Its jaws are even designed like a snake to an extent, even being able to open its mouth wide and swallow some large prey. It can also fire pressurized jets of water from its mouth, much like {@creature Plesioth|MHMM}.",
							"Mizutsune are rather calm in nature until provoked. They prefer to be left alone resting near large bodies of water, while covered in their special secretions. They prefer to avoid confrontations, however, will defend themselves if need be. Once a threat has left, Mizutsune won't chase after the threat but will instead let it go. Though Mizutsune are usually calm, they are known to turn aggressive during Breeding Season. Mizutsune become aggressive or even berserk during their Breeding Season. In this season, it is not a good idea to go fishing from them being known to injure people due to their blind rage. Male Mizutsune have large fins and are able to flash their fins red to show emotion to the female Mizutsune, in order to attract them.",

While feeding on prey, it will use its arms to hold on to its prey while ripping off chunks of flesh.",
							"The length of a Najarala surpasses some of the largest leviathans such as {@creature Agnaktor|MHMM} or {@creature Lagiacrus|MHMM}. As many would notice these creatures have short, yet powerful arms and legs. At first glance these limbs appear to be useless but in reality they enable the creatures to support itself when rearing up. Another fascinating feature is that the creature has a specialized organ on its back that is vibrated by air and creates unique sound waves. This auditory organ has a biological effect in the surrounding area. Najarala have beautiful plates on both its neck and tail that will rattle when upset, giving unwelcome creatures an early warning. The plates on its tail can be thrown at its enemies and will explode creating a loud burst of sound like a sonic bomb. This will stun both prey and enemies alike.",

							"Nakarkos are massive cephalopod-like monsters. They have glowing yellow eyes, and massive, sharp beaks. They have blue skin with spots of turquoise bioluminescence. The most unique feature of a Nakarkos's body is its self-made covering of bones which it uses to protect and camouflage itself. Under normal circumstances, the Nakarkos's face cannot be seen. Its two primary tentacles are covered in vertebrae and tipped with skulls, creating the appearance of a two-headed skeletal dragon. Nakarkos have been reported in many different regions by eyewitnesses, though Nakarkos are known to make huge bone-covered lairs in caves. These lairs are known as Wyvern's End. Nakarkos are also known to be found in the sea.",
							"Nakarkos easily assert themselves as top predators, no matter what the environment is. These Elder Dragons have been identified feeding on the armored prey, such as {@creature Uragaan|MHMM} and {@creature Diablos|MHMM}, and even top predators like {@creature Glavenus|MHMM}, {@creature Brachydios|MHMM}, and {@creature Agnaktor|MHMM}. Even monster species capable of flight aren't safe from this monster. The most shocking creatures these Elder Dragons have been found to take down are {@creature Shen Gaoren|MHMM} and {@creature Ceadeus|MHMM} pups. Other prey includes {@creature Hermitaur|MHMM} and {@creature Daimyo Hermitaur|MHMM}. The only real likely things that could potentially threaten a Nakarkos are other Elder Dragons like older Ceadeus, their only known predator.",
							"Nakarkos are gluttons that can eat a whole ecosystem if left unchecked. Due to Nakarkos having huge appetites, they can easily wipe out all life in surrounding areas. Nakarkos have even been reported shooting down airships for food. Though Nakarkos can destroy an ecosystem, it doesn't actually want to do that. It prefers to leave its nest in search of prey so, it still have plenty of food at the environment it is living within. If the adventurer's Guild finds a Nakarkos' lair, they will immediately send adventurer to repel it before it can bring further damage to that ecosystem. However, it is said that Nakarkos will eventually return to said area in order to feed themselves further.",
							"Nakarkos is able to produce an eerie, blue mucus from its body. This mucus is sticky, allowing it to capture prey and even shoot prey items out of the air. Though this mucus is used for capturing prey, Nakarkos has another use for the mucus. This mucus is used to help prevent bones from corroding, sticking bones together, and to prevent the bones from collapsing. With this mucus, it can make a protective bone armor to protect its whole body from attacks and even use some bones as weapons. Like a cuttlefish, it has sticky tentacles used to drag prey back to its lair. These tentacles are usually covered in bones for protection, ending with a huge skull. But this isn't just limited to skulls. Nakarkos has been seen using various monster parts to attack foes or to kill prey with. Some of these parts are hard to identify due to Nakarkos altering their shapes in order for it to use them. Some parts that it has been seen using is a fused together Glavenus jaw and tail, a {@creature Lagiacrus|MHMM}'s shell shockers, a Brachydios's pounders, and a Uragaan's chin.",
							"These various parts give the appearance that it has \"two heads\" but Nakarkos's true head is hidden away underground most of the time. When it feels its life is truly in danger, it will eventually reveal its true face. Its true face is cephalopod-like, resembling a cuttlefish. By revealing its face, it can use its bone-crunching beak. So to make it easier for itself to use the Fire Beam, it will fire the element from its tentacles and build it up in its mouth before firing a massive beam. To move quickly, Nakarkos has jet propulsion like squids. It uses this to return to its nest at a quicker rate, so it can avoid getting eaten itself.",

					"Namielle is a Elder Dragon that has aspects of manta rays, deep sea fish, and jellyfish. Its massive wings are colored black on top and a light blue on the underside, with rainbow luminescence that pulses constantly. Its head is red and blue with the same pulsing luminescence but when drained of its water and dried out, it has a milky tan coloring that affects both its body and the underside of its wings. It also has multiple long whiskers on the lower jaw.",
					"As with most Elder Dragons, most monsters flee from its mere presence. It asserts itself as the top of the food chain. What it consumes, however, is a mystery. Based on its needlelike dental structure, it can be assumed it preys on fish and possibly piscine wyverns. Only other Elder Dragons and the recently discovered {@creature Savage Deviljho|MHMM}, of which the Brute Wyvern is capable of  equaling its strength, seem to be willing to challenge it.",
					"Namielle is a very unique Elder Dragon its body carries semblance of various creatures found in the ocean. Its wings resemble that of a manta ray's, while the tips can discharge electricity like an electric eel. The membrane of its wings and parts of its face glows with a bioluminescent light that pulses with the color of the rainbow and it has large, needle-shaped teeth like deep-sea fish. There are also combs on its wings like a comb jelly, gifting it further bioluminescence. Its most notable feature, however, is its ability to produce, control and absorb water.",
					"However, said water doesn't appear to be pure water but a mix of its internal saliva and water mixed together to create a slime like water that adheres and stays moist for extended periods of time. This water is shot out of its mouth and can be absorbed back in freely and with a wave of its wings or front claws it can make hunters standing on this water slide back and forth at will. It can also shoot this water at the ground causing a tidal wave to surge up. Even more interesting is that Namielle can actually produce electricity and use the lightning to cause its water patches to electrify then explode violently into steam.",
					"Something rather unique to Namielle is that it can fly even when barely flapping its wings and glide through the air as a manta ray does in water. Namielle also seems to have the ability to blot out the sun with its body, which causes instant darkness. However, it should be noted that this ability was only demonstrated upon initially finding it.",

Nargacuga has the ability to attack with almost every part of its body, mainly its bladed wings and its spiked tail. Its tail erects large spikes which can be flung and linked up with its attacks for devastating hits.

The scales at the end of the tail can also be shaken to produce rattling sounds similar to that of a rattle snake.",

These spikes are believed to be made of a material similar to enamel and can break in a number of ways, though they mostly break from the sheer force of Nergigante's attacks. Unlike other Elder Dragons that use elemental abilities to survive, Nergigante uses brute strength to take on its prey.",
							"Nergigante also has extreme regenerative abilities that allow it to regrow lost spikes, up to 1800 of them, in mere seconds. Researchers theorize that this regenerative process starts when its spikes have taken a certain amount of damage, and it is said that it can regrow them an infinite number of times. It also seems to have the ability to sense highly pure bioenergy.",
							"Nergigante doesn't have a gender and reproduces asexually. It needs large quantities of bioenergy to propagate, but the way it does so is bizarre compared to other species. When Nergigante regenerates its spikes, some of them may gain the bioenergy it has used and begin to produce germ cells, allowing Nergigante to produce another of its kind without the need of a mate. Since Nergigante needs more bioenergy than usual to produce the next generation, it needs to find a food source with incredible strength. Interestingly, the offspring are genetically identical to their parent.",

					"Nerscylla physically resembles a real life Arachnid, but is much larger in size.

In addition, it possesses a massive pair of retractable jaws which can inflict a poisonous bite. It can produce a strong, sticky webbing that it uses to trap prey and build nests. Its long, strong legs allow it to move at fast speeds, even sideways. At the tip of its abdomen is a large stinger it may use to attack. Sharp, poisonous spikes protrude from its back.",
					"These large Temnocerans are ambush predators that will readily attack from behind, below, and above. When making a web they'll wisely construct it in an area where potential prey is most likely to appear. They are most commonly seen to construct their webs near farming settlements where they will attack and kill any livestock that wander into the vicinity of their web for food. Occasionally, they will even snatch away any unwary villagers/farmers that wander into their territory. As stated earlier {@creature Gypceros|MHMM} are the favorite prey of the Nerscylla but the food isn't the only reason why the Bird Wyvern is targeted. When killing a Gypceros the large arachnid not only eats it but disturbingly rips the skin off the avian Wyvern's body and wears it's skin as a cloak. This shocking behavior is both horrifying and intriguing to naturalists. The reason why Nerscylla do this is to increase their strength, use as camouflage, and for protection.",

It spits sand at predators that try to attack it. Its eyes are on top of its head, so it can see its prey easier when lurking in the sand; however, their placement also makes it difficult for it to see anything directly in front of it. They also have salamander-like \"gills\" which it uses to filter out sand and absorb minerals in the sand. It uses this clearing of the sand as an attack, as the sand shoots from the gills at a high enough speed to hurt individuals caught in the blast. Niblesnarf seem to have very strong stomachs, capable of withstanding a bomb exploding in it. Inside the massive mouth of this predator is an enlarged uvula that stores nutrients.

Their mouth is filled with shark-like teeth, and their eyes glow a bright yellow. Their head and back feature large fins which can fold in and out at will.",
							"Plesioth do not possess gills for breathing underwater, so they have to come up for air every so often to fill their lungs with air. In addition to having lungs these creatures can also breath through their skin like an amphibian or sea snake. The fins of Plesioth allow it to swim fast enough to pass a galloping horse. Covering a Plesioth's body is these shiny black scales used to hold in moisture. A scale from older Plesioth can fend off claw and fang attacks. Plesioth have powerful jaws that can crush the shell of Carapaceon, and other armored species, making preying on those species easier. One of its most well-known features is its ability to breath high-pressurized water at its foes. The water that it uses is swallowed while swimming before Plesioth actually uses it as a weapon.",
							"Plesioth can fire highly pressurized jets of water at foes, and can use their massive size and weight to crush and batter attackers. They are highly adept at swimming and are both agile and deadly in the water. Plesioth are ambush predators, adapted to stalking prey from the water and attacking by surprise. They can occasionally be seen on land. Plesioth are commonly found in large bodies of water in a wide variety of environments, such as the jungle, flooded forests, great lake and the coastal ocean waters.",

							"Rathalos are large, bipedal wyverns with a spiny, armored hide covering their body. Their outer shell features much brighter and more vibrant colors than that of their female counterpart, the Rathian. It is primarily bright red, with black markings throughout. Like the {@creature Rathian|MHMM}, Rathalos possess a flame sac which is used to produce deadly flaming projectiles from the mouth. The talons upon their feet are highly poisonous and are known to to inflict toxic mortal wounds on larger prey. In addition, their long, thick tail features a heavy spiked club at the end. Rathalos' wing membranes feature ornate patterns which are likely used to attract potential mates.",
							"Rathalos are expert flyers, and as such are prone to hunting from the skies. By launching a surprise aerial attack, they can inflict poisonous wounds with their talons or burn prey with flaming projectiles. On the ground, Rathalos remain formidable opponents. Using their powerful legs, they can chase down prey from a distance. At a close enough range, they are known to use their sharp teeth to bite at foes as well. Some Rathalos are capable of staying in the air and launching a fireball before landing back to the ground.",
							"Rathalos are highly territorial monsters, and as such, are aggressive towards intruders. They will chase away or attempt to kill any monster which may pose a threat to their land. While hunting, Rathalos will stalk prey from the air before swooping in for the kill. Once they have successfully brought down their prey, they will carry it away to eat in private, safe from scavengers or other large monsters which might attempt to steal the kill.",
							"Rathalos have been spotted in many kinds of environments, from the temperate forest and hills to the extreme heat of a volcano. As a master of flight, they will travel far and wide, searching for prey from the skies.",

Her upper back and wingtips are covered in a moss-like fur not seen on the Rathalos, and while her clubbed tail lacks bony spikes, it makes up for this with its ability to poison foes upon contact.",
							"Rathian, like her mate, can generate flaming projectiles from her mouth. She can use the poisonous barbs on her tail club to inflict blunt-force, toxic wounds on foes, even if her tail was cut off. Her powerful legs allow her to run at high speeds, making her easily capable of chasing down most prey. Like the Rathalos, her vision is very keen, so {@item Flash Bomb|AGMH}s are useful in combat.",
							"Rathian are high-ranking predators in the food chain. She is the female land-dwelling counterpart to the male rathalos who patrols the skies. Both will work together to capture prey and ensure the safety of their nest from predators. rathian often target smaller monsters such as {@creature kelbi|MHMM}, {@creature velociprey|MHMM} and {@creature velocidrome|MHMM} that she can easily carry back to her nest, while the stronger rathalos captures more larger herbivores and lesser wyverns instead. Rathian sits in a position directly below her male counterpart and is more likely to be challenged by monsters such as {@creature anjanath|MHMM}, {@creature jyuratodus|MHMM} and {@creature plesioth|MHMM}.",
							"Yet the female fire wyvern is also ready to engage in precarious fights, especially when it concerns the safety of her nest. Her wrath can only be truly overwhelmed by apex predators such as {@creature tigrex|MHMM}, {@creature nargacuga|MHMM}, {@creature zinogre|MHMM} and the aggresive {@creature diablos|MHMM}. In particular, {@creature glavenus|MHMM} are serious competitors of rathian, and gruelling scars found on rathian can often be attributed to an attack from glavenus. Invasive monsters and elder dragons can also prove serious threats to rathian and her nest.",

					"The Savage Deviljho has many of the same adaptations as a normal Deviljho, however, has a few minor differences. Savage Deviljho are noticeably always enraged. This due to being extremely hungry and constantly needing to feed. Their face is covered like a mask of dragon element, giving it a more sinister look and the hide and the blood of savage deviljho is black in color due to the effects of this element.",
					"The savage deviljho is an even more brutal and rabid monster than the ordinary variety due to its unrelenting hunger. The black blood may drive the savage deviljho to such heightened aggression, even causing it to become a 'rogue' killing machine.",
					"With its appearance in the New World, Savage Deviljho's supreme height in the food chain is finally confirmed. The infamous Variant of the World Eater has been seen directly confronting Elder Dragons like {@creature Velkhana|MHMM}, {@creature Namielle|MHMM} and {@creature Blackveil Vaal Hazak|MHMM}, resulting in violent elemental clashes that often end explosively in stalemates. Perhaps even more terrifyingly, the Savage Deviljho's physical prowess has increased to the point which it can feasibly stand against the immensely powerful Elder Dragon Variant {@creature Ruiner Nergigante|MHMM}, one which specializes in unyielding physical strength.",

In addition, he is commonly known to attach himself to his massive female partner and transport her with his powerful wings.",

The main weapon of the Seltas, his claws, are used as weapon and as tool to hold down and subdue prey.",

							"The Seltas Queen is a very large, beetle-like Neopteron with an armor-like exoskeleton covering its body. She is primarily a lustrous green color, but also features beige stripes and orange spines. She has six limbs, four of which make contact with the ground, the other two being used for digging and grasping prey. In addition, she has a long, segmented tail with a large pincer-like structure at the end. Seltas Queen is the female counterpart to {@creature Seltas|MHMM}, although she is physically very different.",
							"These creatures are the largest known species of Neopteron to date. In fact, they are so heavy that whenever they walk the ground will shake. Seltas Queen have massive and powerful legs that end with two claws. These powerful limbs not only enable the giant insect to climb up rocky, uneven terrain, but greatly make the task of burrowing easy. The large pincers on the tail are mainly used for defense but, can also be used as a another limb for both grabbing objects and prey alike. In its tail, there are specialized organs that produce pheromones that'll send a Seltas flying to a female's exact location. When the male is within range, the female will quickly grab it and inject a special pheromone-like substance that causes the male to cease struggling. The male is then under the female's complete control and will do whatever she requires of him. If in battle, both the male and female will fight as one, this makes fighting the deadly Seltas Queen even deadlier as the two Neopterons will fight as one. A Seltas Queen is also capable of spitting balls of high-pressured watery mucus from its mandibles to slow down and injure prey.",
							"Leading a mainly solitary lifestyle, Seltas Queen will only seek out the company of a Seltas if needed. Whether it be for food, mating, transportation, or added protection a Seltas Queen won't hesitate in releasing her specialized pheromones to bend a male to her will. Amazingly if in battle and in dire need of sustenance a Seltas Queen will not hesitate in violently killing and then eating her male counterpart to survive.",

Larger Seregios have been seen flying with smaller Flying Wyverns clutched in their talons, including other Seregios. Reports like this confirm that the wyverns will cannibalize each other. Due to their capability of living in a number of different environments, Seregios compete with a large number of other large predators. Seregios have also been witnessed aggressively attacking {@creature Rathalos|MHMM} and {@creature Rathian|MHMM} (including their subspecies) and are said to be serious rivals toward them.",
							"The Seregios is covered in extremely sharp Blade Scales. These scales are capable of cutting through the armor of certain prey and flinging them at a distance with good aim. On impact the scales will embed themselves in the victim like shrapnel and can leave complicated gouges in prey and even rocks. The wounds the scales leave behind are extremely painful for the victim and said pain can last for long periods of time, possibly causing infections as well. The most defining trait that this species is that they have Zygodactyly feet like roadrunners and other birds. Seregios are the only species in the Flying Wyvern class that possess them. The feet of these creatures can be used as devastating weapons against prey and enemies alike. A hunting Seregios use their feet to grasp their prey in a vice-like grip giving their victims little hope for escape. When in flight the claws on their wings are utilized for control and to allow them to shift their weight more easily. A Seregios is one of a few wyverns whose flight mobility and control is comparable to a Rathalos. Seregios will also utilize the thick, sturdy blade-like horns on their heads along with their blade-scaled covered tails in combat.",

They are violent fighters and will battle other monsters in order to kick them out of their territory claim it as their own, this includes their own kind in their land. In most cases, the monster they are fighting will end up dead after the battle and while some live on. The bigger the Seregios, the larger amount of territory it needs.

							"Shagaru Magala is the \"adult\" form of {@creature Gore Magala|MHMM}, which transforms by shedding its black skin. Following the skin-shedding, its body is now covered in glittering golden scales, as well as its horns, claws and other spiky protrusions, which changed colors from crimson red / purple to dark brown. The once hidden eyes underneath the horns are also now fully opened. Its ragged-tattered wings also became golden scaly sheets that when fully expanded, resembles a star shape (more specifically, when both wings are expanded.)",
							"Having reached adulthood, Shagaru Magala's physical abilities are greatly enhanced; they are much stronger, more agile, and most of all, more ferocious. Apart from more aggressive melee attacks like the clawed wings-pounce and a grab attack that involves crushing and then hurling hunters around like a ragdoll, their virus breath attacks are also enhanced; with the range of the explosion being larger and dealing more damage.",
							"Like its \"juvenile\" form these drakes have highly specialized wings ending with four large talons at the end that can act as an extra pair of arms. This is very useful when climbing up cliff faces or gripping struggling prey. When exposed to bright sunlight its wings will also refract light into multicolored rays. In their juvenile form as a Gore Magala it lacks eyes, but upon metamorphosing it loses its heat sensors and gains useable eyes. Unlike a Gore Magala it lacks the virus carrying hairs on its wings and instead uses a currently unknown mechanism to spread the {@disease Frenzy Virus|MHMM}. A Shagaru Magala is capable of making the Frenzy Virus cover a much greater range than that of its \"juvenile\" form and has the potential of killing every animal in a single area. The virus strain also seems to be more intense, easily corrupting a mighty beast like {@creature Zinogre|MHMM} and turning pack-monsters like the {@creature Great Baggi|MHMM} and {@creature Baggi|MHMM} against each other. The dark virus aura that envelops a Shagaru Magala is so intense that it's said to dissipate only once the progenitor monster is dead.",
							"These dragons are highly aggressive and territorial predators that won't hesitate in attacking hunters if spotted. Like elder dragons, Shagaru Magala are very rare and are considered myths in some lands. Part of this due to the fact that it takes years for a Gore Magala to molt. Many believe that when the molting process is about to begin said creature will travel to the Heaven's Mount to complete the process. In legend Shagaru Magala is known as \"The Punishing God of the Mountains\" due to its role of nearly wiping out all life in the mountains. The reason for this is to claim territory for themselves, prevent rivals from molting properly, and to release the next generation of Gore Magala into their territory. Their infected mist not only contains a stronger version of the Frenzy Virus but also their parasitic offspring. Their offspring live in an infected host, whether it is dead or alive, and their host acts as nursery for the young. They get their nutrition and everything they need from their host before eventually bursting out of their host's body. Once Shagaru Magala is finished breeding in a territory, it'll leave the area for its next generation and begin to wander around the world randomly. They don't reproduce again for quite awhile due to trying to prevent future monster generations from gaining a resistance against their virus while reproducing. Thus far, only three Shagaru Magala have been sighted, two of which have been killed. Many people believe that the Shagaru Magala and Gore Magala represent light and darkness.",

Given its incredible size, predators such as {@creature tigrex|MHMM}, {@creature deviljho|MHMM}, stygian zinogre, azure rathalos, {@creature rajang|MHMM} and even the infamous {@creature shagaru magala|MHMM} would most likely avoid the beast at all costs.",

					"Shah dalamadur sport a lighter, sand-colored hide with red-orange spines after molting out of their old skin. After molting, shah dalamadur have no control over their metabolism, meaning their body temperature will constantly change. When cold, a shah dalamadur's hide can repel most attacks. When hot, the hide of a shah dalamadur is vulnerable to most attacks. From their body temperature constantly changing, shah dalamadur are able to perform an ability never seen before by a normal dalamadur. Shah dalamadur are able to burn the very ground with their powerful heated metabolism through just about any part of their body that is heated. This heat can leave behind powerful flames with just a single touch.",

Shen Gaoren are so large they use a {@creature Lao-Shan Lung|MHMM} skull for protection. Their colossal size helps them to defeat most creatures. The diet of Shen Gaoren is unknown; however, it is likely to be omnivorous, like most real-life crabs.",
							"Its massive pincers are increbibly strong and sturdy, being described as capable of cutting through even the toughest volcanic rock. Its long legs give the Shen Gaoren an incredible field-of-vision, and if its eyesight is proficient, it should be able to spot prey from a very large distance. Like many other Carapaceons, its rear section is naturally very soft, and, if left unprotected, it's a large weak point. Fortunately, for them, Shen Gaoren are able to acquire the equally gigantic skull shells of the mighty Lao-Shan Lung, whether they are actually able to kill the massive dragon is still uncertain, but unprobable, which serves as incredibly efficient armor. It has been recently found that the gigantic skull shows signs of containing the deadly dragon element but Shen Gaoren doesn't seem to use the this element. The Shen Gaoren is grey/blue in color, but its legs turn red as they experience great pain.",
							"One of Shen Gaoren's deadliest abilities is its ability to shoot a gigantic ball of acid from its gigantic skull. This acidic ball can corrode armor rather quickly and, in some cases, it can even melt straight through the armor. Its unknown how this monster is able to produce this acid or even fire it out of its skull.",
							"Due to Shen Gaoren not being seen interacting with other species, it is unknown how it fits into the ecological niche. Shen Gaorens are relatively passive by nature. They move about without noticing hunters; however, when enraged, it may attempt to attack hunters by using their huge sturdy claws or by moving their legs and pincers wildly. It was recently discovered that Shen Gaoren attack villages and cities because they are in its territory. Shen Gaoren were found to attack any foe that pose any threat to them, showing that these passive giants can be aggressive when they feel that their life is in danger. When Shen Gaoren get old enough, or injured in battle, they'll molt.",

Its tail spikes are covered in both and have a unique trait that puts it apart from normal individuals. Silverwind Nargacuga is able to generate blades of air by swinging its cutwings or slamming its tail, attacking prey from a distance. The waves of wind are powerful enough to cut up prey, making a creature bleed, and weakening the foe. This new found trait truly makes silverwind nargacuga a quick killer.

							"Known as the \"Thunder Wyvern.\" {@creature Astalos|MHMM} body is almost entirely covered in sharp, dark green plating, although it has a more bright colored underside. Unlike any other Flying Wyvern, Astalos' wings resemble those of an insect, most precisely a glasswing butterfly's wings. Its thin legs have three toes. Its tail is long, making up almost half of the monster's length, and it has two pair of earwig-like pincers at the tip. It has a relatively small head, with a big horn on top of it. Its eyes are red.",
							"Astalos are high up in the food chain. They are known to be predators and have been found to feed on Herbivore like {@creature Mosswine|MHMM} and {@creature Aptonoth|MHMM}. Astalos have also been observed eating Neopteron like {@creature Vespoid|MHMM} and lesser predators like {@creature Velocidrome|MHMM}. Despite being top predators, Astalos have to compete with other large predatory monsters like {@creature Rathalos|MHMM}, {@creature Najarala|MHMM}, {@creature Seregios|MHMM}, and {@creature Seltas Queen|MHMM}.",
							"Astalos's whole body is an electrical organ. Astalos uses Piezoelectricity - as an Astalos fights and becomes more active, Its tail, wings, and crest will begin to charge up with electricity. This can easily be seen by looking for green surges of electricity on those parts of its body. Astalos's flying abilities are comparable to a Rathalos with the help of its powerful wings. Its wings are tough, covered in spikes, and are even used as weapons on the ground. The wings can also produce a special electrical charge used for capturing prey. Its pincer-like tail is used for capturing and paralyzing prey.",
							"They've been seen attacking large Flying Wyverns, like Rathalos, even if those monsters are not interested in the Astalos's presence. Even if the enemy is losing the fight, Astalos will fight them relentlessly, even if they are trying to escape. If the enemy is killed, the Astalos may feed on the enemy's corpse, as it is sometimes known to do. Astalos will even sometimes cannibalize their own young by accident. This is due to the adults mistaking the young for Neopteron like Vespoid occasionally. To prevent this, Astalos guard their nest up until the eggs are ready to hatch before leaving the young to fend for themselves. Even while young, Astalos don't hesitate about anything, including cannibalism, and can be quite violent. When a town gets reports of this monster, they are known to send adventurers immediately to hunt it down. This is due to Astalos actually disrupting the ecological balance in an area.",

The long and elastic tongue can extend to grasp and steal items from a distance. Its wings are a purple color with a grayish white membrane, and are used for flight and controlling the direction of its poison fog. Chameleos's large tail is reminiscent of a leaf and has a curled, spiraling tip.",
							"Chameleos are different from other Elder Dragons, as they are not nearly as \"elegant\" in their appearance as other Elder Dragon species. Chameleos have a number of biological adaptations that make them extremely unique. Most notably is the Chameleos's trademark camouflage mechanism. Each species of Chameleos has a different way of camouflaging itself. By generating a weak electric current in its skin that interacts with the mist it can breathe, the Elder Dragon can bend light around itself, rendering it effectively invisible. Some Chameleos use special ore to enable their camouflage. Chameleos have independently moving eyeballs that protrude from the sides of its head to create a wider field of vision. Chameleos have several nasty defenses should it ever come under attack. They possess an extremely strong poison, which can be released from its mouth at will and often whipped into a thick cloud by the dragon's wings. Some Chameleos also possess an extra vocal cord paralysis poison in their acid globs. Finally, it can exhale large amounts of mist to further hinder the vision of hunters, allowing it to either make a swift getaway or launch a surprise attack with ease.",
							"Chameleos are ambush hunters, waiting patiently for prey to pass by while they blend perfectly into their surroundings. Chameleos can and will eat almost anything, and can use different tactics to take down varying sizes of prey. Should its prey be a Neopteron such as a {@creature Vespoid|MHMM}, {@creature Altaroth|MHMM}, {@creature Bnahabra|MHMM}, or {@creature Konchu|MHMM} it will simply snatch it out of the air using its long sticky tongue. If it is a supply camp, it'll steal with each opportunity it gets.",
							"Chameleos are very intelligent creatures. They will wait patiently at a spot of importance such as a water source or natural crossroads, waiting for prey to pass by.

							"{@creature Daimyo Hermitaur|MHMM} has a large, crab-like body. It is covered in a red and white carapace and wears the skull of a {@creature Monoblos|MHMM} as a protective shell. They have huge, thick claws capable of holding prey as well as shielding the giant crab from most any attacks. Daimyo Hermitaur's shell is also very tough, able to deflect the blows of most weapons. The one chink in the creature's armor is its soft hindquarters, where many of the creature's major organs are stored. To fix this problem, Daimyo Hermitaur will wear the skulls of dead wyverns on their backs. Acquiring the right size shell is a chore though, and occasionally Daimyo Hermitaur can be spotted with shells too large, or small for their bodies. Almost all of Daimyo Hermitaur's shells come from members of the larger species like Monoblos. Daimyo Hermitaur also possess surprisingly strong legs, able to move the creature with great speed if necessary. The legs assist the creature in digging holes and they are able to launch themselves many feet into the air, causing them to land vigorously on top of hunters who don't react fast enough.",
							"Some unusual rare Daimyo Hermitaur have a dark reddish color on their claws, darker legs and more shiny eyes. Along with this their shells are unusually covered in moss or algae. They also have the ability to spit long streams of water. They use new attack techniques as their claws are much stronger than average, they use their claws in a shielded position much like a human boxing while walking at a target, these claws are reported to be so strong in this position that ranged projectiles fired from guns ricochet, along with this new smarter advancing technique they perform a very aggressive non stop side to side claw snapping attack behavior that out-speeds most attackers.",
							"Despite their size, Daimyo Hermitaur are fairly calm, when undisturbed. However, Daimyo Hermitaur will turn aggressive if they feel threatened or attacked. Most of time, they can be seen foraging for food as they roam around their environment.",

							"In legend, it is said that all living things fear Fatalis, including other Elder Dragons, such as {@creature Teostra|MHMM} and {@creature Lao-Shan Lung|MHMM}. All monsters are said to try to avoid Fatalis at all costs, leading to some leaving areas altogether simply to avoid it.",
							"The Fatalis is a powerful, unnatural beast. The Fatalis's scales are extremely thick, while its shell is very durable. This is due to Fatalis melting the armor of its fallen prey on its shell, increasing its protection against some attacks. Fatalis doesn't seem to have very good eyesight, though this maybe partially be due to what its eyes are made of. Creepily, a Fatalis's eyes are made out of crystals. How is unknown. Fatalis's wing membrane is flexible, but as hard as metal. From this, Fatalis's wings don't break very easily, allowing it to fly at high speeds and support itself as it becomes airborne. Even on the ground, Fatalis is able to walk on all fours and rush prey at shocking speeds with sheer power behind its bulk. The most powerful feature is its powerful fiery breath. This fire is some of the strongest fire breath out of all monsters and can kill most enemies almost instantly. Recent encounters have revealed that Fatalis possess control over fire on par with Teostra and {@creature Lunastra|MHMM}. Its fire breath extends well beyond the length and height of the already large dragon.",
							"In some legends about the Fatalis, there is a legend known by some as the shifting scales of fate. This legend claims that the Second Coming of Fatalis is infinite. The Fatalis in this legend is quite different from the Fatalis seen in the other legends. This Fatalis is described to have six horns, a glowing blue chest, a short mane in between its spikes, bizarre fluids flowing through out its body, and the ability to shift its scales from black, red, or white. Each set of scales is said to grant the fatalis different abilities and protection. The most well known of these skills are the Black Flame and Crimson Demons breath that are said to combine the elements Fire and Death together, Despite both being combined together with the same elements, Each breath has a different element that seems to overtake this Fatalis's body, allowing it to do things not seen in other legends. This Fatalis is said to be able to send monsters running with a single flap of its wings.",
							"A creepy light coming from its eyes invites those it stares at into its dark depths. The fluids are said to have no exact weight. Its shell is impervious to strikes from weapons and has terrifying power inside of it, which could be unleashed at anytime. The scariest part about this legend is that not only is its strength far beyond the ones from the other legends, but its body shows signs of possible regenerative powers. This means that this Fatalis maybe able to regenerate after taking large amounts of damage, just like Dire Miralis can regenerate from its still beating heart. Thankfully, this legend hasn't been proven as of yet so the Guild has nothing to worry about.",
							"One thing that all the legends share about Fatalis is its equipment. This equipment is much more than what it appears to be. When adventurers wear this monster's armor, they are known to disappear mysteriously without a trace or even die if the armor is worn for too long. Some who have worn the Fatalis's armor report having terrible nightmares, unsettling strength, and a feeling as if they were being possessed by something. They also report feeling a familiar pulse coming from the armor, a feeling as if their legs were taken from them. With some adventurers wearing the armor of the Black Flame, they report feeling as if their body was taken over while they were unconscious. It is said that this equipment might be alive, meaning that Fatalis might not truly be dead. In Pokke Village, a giant black blade embedded in the ice is known to regenerate days after being mined once, which supports this claim that Fatalis is still alive. Other Fatalis weapons also seem to suggest that Fatalis is still alive in some form. Some weapons despair eat at the user's hands while other weapons, when held, have hideous abyssal screams coming from them. Some weapons even have a thirst for blood. From this, it is said that it's best to not to use any equipment from Fatalis in any form at all.",
							"Fatalis is extremely hostile to all living things. It threatens the very existence of not only the Castle Schrade, but the very world around it. In legend, it is said Fatalis could scorch the whole world with its flames in a few days, burning all lands to a crisp. Due to this, the Guild will secretly send adventurers to hunt it down to prevent public panic. However, most adventurers never return. Due to many incidents surrounding Schrade Kingdom and Fatalis, the Adventurer's Guild has classified everything about both away from the public. Fatalis's armor and quest are only allowed to those that have proven they are quite credible.",

							"{@creature Gore Magala|MHMM} is unlike anything anyone has ever seen before. In light of the discovery that it is the juvenile form of the {@creature Shagaru Magala|MHMM}, some scholars have proposed that it be classified as an Elder Dragon, but until a consensus is reached it has been given the placeholder classification of Unknown.",
							"Gore Magala is a very unique wyvern, sharing traits and similarities to that of the Elder Dragons, possessing six limbs, including the clawed wings on its back. Though, its overall appearance and stance resembles a quadrupedal wyvern like the {@creature Nargacuga|MHMM}. Its body is covered in dark exoskeleton plates, with notable features including the hidden feelers that are folded alongside its face, the lack of visible eyes and fanged jaws that are actually parts of its external armor plates. The other unique part is its wings, which are covered in jet-black fur that resemble a tattered and ragged cape. The claws on its wings are extremely prehensile, and even seem to possess opposable thumbs. They are used for grabbing, help at running and maintaining stability. When not engaged in combat, Gore Magala tends to cloak its body with its wings by latching them onto its back.",
							"Gore Magala has an unusually high metabolism but rarely feeds on much prey. Due to this metabolism, its hairs on its wings are constantly left behind and flying in the air. These hairs are used to understand their environment and leave behind a trail that Gore Magala uses to see both predators and prey by heat. Once it smells something in the area, it will begin to spread around its hairs around the area in order to find the target and these hairs will attach onto the target, allowing the Gore Magala to see them with heat. As Gore Magala's senses increase and become better from these hairs, its color under its wings will slowly change and get brighter. When its sense are at their highest peak, two antennae will appear from its head and it will release a large amounts of hairs into the air. The hairs in the sky will darken the sky as if an eclipse was in the area and it will begin to walk on all six. This is its Frenzy State. When it enters this state, it will begin to use its wing claws to allow it to walk and attack better using them. These claws can leave deep gouges in prey that are said to never heal.",
							"Gore Magala's most infamous feature is the {@disease Frenzy Virus|MHMM}. This virus is spread from Gore Magala's scales and hairs while its breath has similar properties to them. When in its Frenzy State, Gore Magala is able to make explosions in the area by combining the hairs in the atmosphere around it with a spark from its mouth. The Frenzy Virus causes some abnormalities in the nervous system, increased physical strength, and a decrease in the body's resistance. This virus makes all monsters extremely violent and eventually kills most of them. Some may overcome the effects of the Frenzy Virus and actually develop a relationship with it, becoming physically stronger from the virus while also spreading the virus like Gore Magala in order to get rid of competition from their own species. These rare individuals are known as Apex Monsters.",
							"Gore Magalas are highly aggressive, elusive monsters. These monsters show great amounts of aggression and have shown great amounts of intelligence. Some have even been shown to play dead before slipping away when given an opportunity too. Despite competing with other powerful predators, Gore Magalas have rarely been seen with any wounds or scars on their body. Though these monsters are aggressive, they are more aggressive when its time for them to return to the Heaven's Mount and go to the Sanctuary. The reason for this is for the Gore Magala to molt into a legendary Shagaru Magala that once nearly wiped out every living thing in the mountains.",
							"Interestingly, Gore Magala have been known to attack seafaring ships during their voyages across the great seas.",

					"Namielle is a Elder Dragon that has aspects of manta rays, deep sea fish, and jellyfish.

Its head is red and blue with the same pulsing luminescence but when drained of its water and dried out, it has a milky tan coloring that affects both its body and the underside of its wings. It also has multiple long whiskers on the lower jaw.",
					"As with most Elder Dragons, most monsters flee from its mere presence. It asserts itself as the top of the food chain. What it consumes, however, is a mystery. Based on its needlelike dental structure, it can be assumed it preys on fish and possibly piscine wyverns. Only other Elder Dragons and the recently discovered {@creature Savage Deviljho|MHMM}, of which the Brute Wyvern is capable of  equaling its strength, seem to be willing to challenge it.",
					"Namielle is a very unique Elder Dragon its body carries semblance of various creatures found in the ocean. Its wings resemble that of a manta ray's, while the tips can discharge electricity like an electric eel. The membrane of its wings and parts of its face glows with a bioluminescent light that pulses with the color of the rainbow and it has large, needle-shaped teeth like deep-sea fish. There are also combs on its wings like a comb jelly, gifting it further bioluminescence. Its most notable feature, however, is its ability to produce, control and absorb water.",
					"However, said water doesn't appear to be pure water but a mix of its internal saliva and water mixed together to create a slime like water that adheres and stays moist for extended periods of time. This water is shot out of its mouth and can be absorbed back in freely and with a wave of its wings or front claws it can make hunters standing on this water slide back and forth at will. It can also shoot this water at the ground causing a tidal wave to surge up. Even more interesting is that Namielle can actually produce electricity and use the lightning to cause its water patches to electrify then explode violently into steam.",
					"Something rather unique to Namielle is that it can fly even when barely flapping its wings and glide through the air as a manta ray does in water. Namielle also seems to have the ability to blot out the sun with its body, which causes instant darkness. However, it should be noted that this ability was only demonstrated upon initially finding it.",

On impact the scales will embed themselves in the victim like shrapnel and can leave complicated gouges in prey and even rocks. The wounds the scales leave behind are extremely painful for the victim and said pain can last for long periods of time, possibly causing infections as well. The most defining trait that this species is that they have Zygodactyly feet like roadrunners and other birds. Seregios are the only species in the Flying Wyvern class that possess them. The feet of these creatures can be used as devastating weapons against prey and enemies alike. A hunting Seregios use their feet to grasp their prey in a vice-like grip giving their victims little hope for escape. When in flight the claws on their wings are utilized for control and to allow them to shift their weight more easily. A Seregios is one of a few wyverns whose flight mobility and control is comparable to a Rathalos. Seregios will also utilize the thick, sturdy blade-like horns on their heads along with their blade-scaled covered tails in combat.",

							"{@creature Shagaru Magala|MHMM} is the \"adult\" form of {@creature Gore Magala|MHMM}, which transforms by shedding its black skin. Following the skin-shedding, its body is now covered in glittering golden scales, as well as its horns, claws and other spiky protrusions, which changed colors from crimson red / purple to dark brown. The once hidden eyes underneath the horns are also now fully opened. Its ragged-tattered wings also became golden scaly sheets that when fully expanded, resembles a star shape (more specifically, when both wings are expanded.)",
							"Having reached adulthood, Shagaru Magala's physical abilities are greatly enhanced; they are much stronger, more agile, and most of all, more ferocious. Apart from more aggressive melee attacks like the clawed wings-pounce and a grab attack that involves crushing and then hurling hunters around like a ragdoll, their virus breath attacks are also enhanced; with the range of the explosion being larger and dealing more damage.",
							"Like its \"juvenile\" form these drakes have highly specialized wings ending with four large talons at the end that can act as an extra pair of arms. This is very useful when climbing up cliff faces or gripping struggling prey. When exposed to bright sunlight its wings will also refract light into multicolored rays. In their juvenile form as a Gore Magala it lacks eyes, but upon metamorphosing it loses its heat sensors and gains useable eyes. Unlike a Gore Magala it lacks the virus carrying hairs on its wings and instead uses a currently unknown mechanism to spread the {@disease Frenzy Virus|MHMM}. A Shagaru Magala is capable of making the Frenzy Virus cover a much greater range than that of its \"juvenile\" form and has the potential of killing every animal in a single area. The virus strain also seems to be more intense, easily corrupting a mighty beast like {@creature Zinogre|MHMM} and turning pack-monsters like the {@creature Great Baggi|MHMM} and {@creature Baggi|MHMM} against each other. The dark virus aura that envelops a Shagaru Magala is so intense that it's said to dissipate only once the progenitor monster is dead.",
							"These dragons are highly aggressive and territorial predators that won't hesitate in attacking hunters if spotted. Like elder dragons, Shagaru Magala are very rare and are considered myths in some lands. Part of this due to the fact that it takes years for a Gore Magala to molt. Many believe that when the molting process is about to begin said creature will travel to the Heaven's Mount to complete the process. In legend Shagaru Magala is known as \"The Punishing God of the Mountains\" due to its role of nearly wiping out all life in the mountains. The reason for this is to claim territory for themselves, prevent rivals from molting properly, and to release the next generation of Gore Magala into their territory. Their infected mist not only contains a stronger version of the Frenzy Virus but also their parasitic offspring. Their offspring live in an infected host, whether it is dead or alive, and their host acts as nursery for the young. They get their nutrition and everything they need from their host before eventually bursting out of their host's body. Once Shagaru Magala is finished breeding in a territory, it'll leave the area for its next generation and begin to wander around the world randomly. They don't reproduce again for quite awhile due to trying to prevent future monster generations from gaining a resistance against their virus while reproducing. Thus far, only three Shagaru Magala have been sighted, two of which have been killed. Many people believe that the Shagaru Magala and Gore Magala represent light and darkness.",

Being predatory Elder Dragons Teostra are powerful top predators and are easily capable of killing weaker animals such as {@creature Aptonoth|MHMM}, {@creature Conga|MHMM}, {@creature Bulldrome|MHMM}, {@creature Iodrome|MHMM}, {@creature Apceros|MHMM}, and {@creature Cephadrome|MHMM}. Armed with razor sharp claws and flesh ripping teeth these Elder Dragons make short work of prey and smaller predators.",
							"Possessing mastery over flame, there are few creatures that can hope to last against Teostra for long. To defend itself, the Teostra also utilizes a heat shield which damages enemies that get too close. To keep its flame powers going, they consume coal in volcanic environments. It also has detachable wing scales or powder that explode when ignited from a spark made when Teostra bites. It uses these to defend itself from attackers, although they give little protection against enemies with resilience to extreme heat such as {@creature Akantor|MHMM} or {@creature Lavasioth|MHMM}.",
							"Teostra can even use the powder for many close range attacks but more skilled Teostra have learnt to use the powder at long range. When Teostra angered, it will fly into the air and ignite the powder all at once. When the powder is all ignited, Teostra will be covered in a large burst of fire, that is sometimes referred to as the Supernova.",
							"Some extremely rare individuals have more control over their flaming powers than {@creature teostra|MHMM|most}. They have a different appearance also including more yellow wing webbing, a more reddish mane, red claws, orange tail end and golden eyes. New flame techniques include leaving pockets of explosive powder across the area in the air as it fights and setting them all a flame at will.",
							"Teostra are a very aggressive monster. It will show dominance to anything that it encounters. Compared to Lunastra, who give warnings to get out of its territory, Teostra will ruthlessly attack intruders until they are dead. As one of the most aggressive Elder Dragons, Teostra are highly feared. It is not advised to go out into the Desert, Volcano, Swamp, or Tower when pairing with {@creature Lunastra|MHMM}, as the prospect of fighting both Lunastra and Teostra together is often considered suicidal.",

It also has detachable wing scales or powder that explode when ignited from a spark made when Teostra bites. It uses these to defend itself from attackers, although they give little protection against enemies with resilience to extreme heat such as {@creature Akantor|MHMM} or {@creature Lavasioth|MHMM}.",

On rare occasions they can be seen living in more temperate areas such as a swamp or ancient forest, changing the area around it to suit its needs.",

On many occasions a teostra will attempt to take a red dragon's lair for its own, either by killing the red dragon or causing it to flee while gravely injured, leaving its horde of treasure behind. The teostra will guard this horde, mainly because it now belongs to him, but will typically not add to its treasure, being more concerned with intruders than riches.",

							"Tetsucabra is a large Amphibian with a striking orange and indigo coloration. Its lower jaw harbors large tusks along with a large set of molars that are capable of crushing prey with ease. Tetsucabra also has a spiky stubby tail that swells up when angered.",
							"The scales of a Tetsucabra is used mainly for camouflage inside caves and on them is a special oil that holds heat. Despite the look of the scales, its skin is actually flexible yet hard somewhat resembling an actual toad's skin. A Tetsucabra's skull is robust and durable enough to take a lot of damage from threats of all sorts. Though the Tetsucabra has two large tusks, these are not used for hunting. The primary function of these tusks is for defense and as means to manipulate the environment. The tusks themselves are capable weapons, but the Tetsucabra is also capable of hefting up heavy boulders. The Tetsucabra flings these boulders out of the way of its path but it can also use this as a method of attack to injure predator and prey alike. It uses these boulders as a shield against predators and hunters to prevent attacks. It also uses this to enclose small, tight areas, making it harder to maneuver. Another fact about the Tetsucabra is its ability to spit a glob of fluid at prey items. This sticky material acts as a powerful adhesive, sticking to the body and ground like glue. Even for a hunter, the adhesive quality of this material is not very strong, but it makes every movement a labor and greatly weakens the prey, leading to a reduction in stamina. When the Tetsucabra exerts itself, its tail inflates, possibly to help it balance itself as it picks up large boulders and rocks. The legs of a Tetsucabra help it perform powerful leaps, lunges, and jumps in the air to help it either ambush prey or to reach steep slopes out of its reach. A Tetsucabra's claws are powerful enough to break rock with ease and can destroy powerful armor.",
							"Tetsucabra are highly aggressive, territorial monsters though their ecology is much like a frog. The amphibians are well-known for attacking and eating anything that moves in their line of sight and leaping from ponds in order to grab potential prey. Despite being found in ponds, they spend most of their time on land, which could suggest that they patrol their territory on land, much like {@creature Zamtrios|MHMM}. During the breeding season male Tetsucabra will create large holes to impress females so that they'll lay their eggs in them. When the female lays her eggs in the pit the male will quickly fertilize them. After fertilizing the eggs the male will then carry them in his mouth and he will not eat anything until the offspring are fully developed.",

It has two large, backward-facing horns on the head. The mouth has multiple smaller teeth. Between the hind legs is a gigantic golden sac, in which Ibushi lacks, and on Narwa's head, chest, back, forelegs, and tail tips are purple electrical organs that produce electromagnetic force that lifts the serpent airborne.",

With the help of Minoto's resonation with the Thunder Serpent, the guild was able to determine Narwa's whereabouts while she was waiting for her \"king\". Every fifty years, Narwa, as well as the Wind Serpent Ibushi, will emerge to mate with each other, while Ibushi wanders around various locales, Narwa seems to wait in a location she prefers until Ibushi is able to locate her. However, the disturbance caused by her presence and electromagnetic abilities tend to drive other monsters berserk, leading to a Rampage event that regularly hits Kamura Village during the Serpent's mating process.",

The Tigrex can be found in many different environments. If combat becomes intense enough, it will flush blood to its forelimbs, face, and eyes, in order to give its skin a bright-red glow as an effort to further intimidate attackers.

							"A mysterious wyvern said only to appear after large avalanches deep in the snowy mountains. Often seen crushing ice balls and rock into powder in its stride, it's known to most as Ukanlos, although there are whisperings it may be the white god... Ukanlos is a Flying Wyvern that is closely related to the {@creature Akantor|MHMM}. Originally, like Akantor, Ukanlos was classified as a Elder Dragon due to it not fitting in any other class but after much research it has been found to be a large species of Flying Wyvern.",
							"Ukanlos are apex predators that can virtually feed on anything they'd want. Animals like {@creature Popo|MHMM}, {@creature Bulldrome|MHMM}, and {@creature Anteka|MHMM} are common prey. However being indiscriminate feeders Ukanlos will also prey on other predators such as {@creature Tigrex|MHMM}, {@creature Barioth|MHMM}, {@creature Khezu|MHMM}, {@creature Blangonga|MHMM}, Abiorugu, Doragyurosu, {@creature Deviljho|MHMM} and even Elder Dragons such as {@creature Kirin|MHMM} or {@creature Kushala Daora|MHMM} are fair game for these behemoths. Ukanlos will also eat the ice and absorb minerals, however this beast is rather large so the amount of ice it would have to eat would be huge.",
							"Ukanlos closely resembles Akantor in body structure and possesses the same quadrupedal gait. It has a silvery-white carapace which features a row of large, jagged fins along its back. It has a small, compact face which features glowing yellow eyes, sharp teeth, and a massive, shovel-like jaw. Its massive serrated shovel-like jaw allows it to fling up large chunks of ice and to dig through the ice with ease. Ukanlos has grown an extremely tough and streamlined carapace with large razor sharp fins running along its spine to \"swim\" though the ice.",
							"The Ukanlos can produce an ice beam from its mouth to attack anything foolish enough to attempt to harm it, and is known to use its heavy body weight to crush opponents and its jaws are capable of crushing ice and rock alike. Despite its great size and weight, Ukanlos is known to be able to leap significant distances. In order to survive the weather this creature may have a large layer of fat underneath its hard shell. This layer of flesh is visible underneath its forearms, showing a light-blue underflesh. This beast also hibernate for vast periods of time to survive after feeding.",
							"Ukanlos lives a solitary life, and has only ever been encountered in remote, frozen regions. It is fiercely territorial to any who intrude upon its land. Ukanlos have been found to attack and destroy villages that are built in its territory after waking from hibernation.",

					"Valstrax is a slender Elder Dragon covered in gleaming silver scales. Its most notable feature is its wings, which have fused into a trident-like structure. Its back is lined with fin-like projections. Its head has a small crest and its eyes are blue.",
					"Valstrax is covered in reflective silver scales that give this monster its slim appearance. Like most other Elder Dragons, valstrax has six limbs: four legs and a pair of wings. Unique to valstrax are its trident shaped wings. The wings of the valstrax are versatile and flexible being able to stretch the arm appendages to hit far-reaching targets, expanding its wings resembling a three-fingered claw for wider area of attack or closing the wings to make use of the blade-like tip on the frontal end of the wings that is commonly used with the stretching appendages as \"jabs\" akin to that of a spear for accurate attacks. On the ends of both of the wings are three openings that fire off energy produced via a special organ in its chest that sucks in the air before releasing it out through the wings as a form exhaust. This allows it to fly at outrageous speeds, making it the fastest flying monster known today. When flying at high speeds, it looks like a \"red comet\" in the sky, showing that at its highest speed no one can identify it easily.",
					"Valstrax can also flip its wings in two different directions: Backwards; for flying at high speeds, and Forward; attacking foes from a distance by using the energy as projectiles. valstrax's breathing methods are nearly identical to birds in a sense. The special organ in its chest is constantly glowing red and occasionally pulses whenever valstrax decides to use it for certain actions, such as flying.",
					"Valstrax are quite calm when not disturbed, but will turn extremely aggressive if they feel threatened in anyway. No matter the foe, valstrax have a variety of ways of fighting off threats. This is the reason why it is sometimes called the Silver Wing of the Evil Star or Sky Comet Dragon. Though valstrax are quite calm in the sky, they occasionally will mistakenly crash into objects in the air from their shocking flying speeds. These objects can be about the size of an Airship or even a Flying Wyvern.",

It will typically avoid trouble, but if cornered, Volvidon can be surprisingly aggressive.",

At the first sight of trouble the large Fanged Beast will roll up and if possible quickly roll away, but if cornered Volvidon can be surprisingly aggressive.

							"Ibushi is the male of an elder dragon species that consists of itself and the {@creature Thunder Serpent Narwa|MHMM}. Similar to {@creature Amatsumagatsuchi|MHMM|Amatsu}, this species has a long and leviathan-like body with short hind legs and a long tail (though in the case of the Serpents, their legs are more paddle or fin-like). This species also has two sets of jaws, with the lower outer jaw and both inner jaws being split jaws.",
							"Being the male of the species, Ibushi have several traits that sets themselves apart from Narwa. Ibushi have spiky, light blue shells that adorn their light blue body. On their head are several narrow horns that point upward, with somes angled forward. The most prominent trait, which gives the males their title, are wind sacs which Ibushi use to float around. These wind sacs are located on the forelegs, back, chest, and tail tips, marked by the presence of glowing tendrils on Ibushi's body. The wind sacs are capable of inflating to a degree and produce a special gas that Ibushi can freely control, which is then primarily used for it's own propulsion.",
							"Not much is known about Ibushi prior to its discovery. However, what is known is that Ibushi wanders around in the sky in search of its \"queen\", as referred to by Hinoa during their resonation. Every fifty years, Ibushi, as well as the Thunder Serpent Narwa, will emerge to mate with each other; in order to do so, Ibushi will wander the land to seek out Narwa. Ibushi is also known to cause destructive storms by sending dragon energy into the ground. This turbulence is strong enough to uproot trees and wipe out the landscape. This causes nearby monsters to become terrified and flee directly into Kamura Village, and is thus the primary cause of the Rampage.",
							"Ibushi is said to exhibit inexplicable behaviors such as floating upside down in the air. It can send out orbs of dragon energy from its tail, as well as causing air explosions from the wind sacs on its arms. The dragon energy Ibushi releases can cause updrafts to appear, which are strong enough to send a hunter into the air. Ibushi can also breathe a beam of energy from its mouth.",

							"Xeno'jiiva is a large dragon with an otherworldly appearance. It has two eyes and six orange glowing spots running up the length of its horns. Parts of its body glow ethereal blue, making its skin appear crystalline and translucent. Its wings are frayed at the edge of the membrane and are grayish-blue in color.",
							"Little is known about Xeno'jiiva since it is an entirely new species of Elder Dragon unknown to the Guild. The Third Fleet Master proposes that Xeno'jiiva might be a creature that needs to consume the energies of other lifeforms to grow. Although she admits that it might've been a coincidence that Xeno'jiiva wounded up thriving in the Elder's Recess, she doesn't believe in coincidence.",
							"It is unknown whether Xeno'jiiva is the cause of the Elder Crossing, or if the New World was already a graveyard for dragons and Xeno'jiiva was merely exploiting the resident energies of the land. Either way, it incubated in the bioenergy and craved more, using some sort of pheromone to draw more Elders across the sea.",
							"From its wings being folded up tightly in its cocoon, they aren't yet fully functional, meaning Xeno'jiiva can't immediately fly upon emergence. Once energy has flowed into its wings, it's capable of flight. It has five fingers on its hands and four toes on its feet, both ending in razor-sharp claws. It uses its hands to attack enemies, cleaving flesh right off the bone, while it can stand upright for short periods by using its rear legs. Xeno'jiiva is often called the \"Dark Light Dragon\" from a red glowing organ inside of its chest. This heat organ distributes large amounts of energy to Xeno'jiiva's arms, tail, and head to amplify its strength. By concentrating its energy in those parts of its body, Xeno'jiiva can release mounds of it all at once when it attacks. Its energy is most concentrated in its head. Instead of destructive explosions like its other parts, Xeno'jiiva can breathe powerful beams that burn just about anything that comes in contact with them, including the ground. By firing those beams out of its mouth, it is able to maintain the amount of energy inside of its body.",
							"If its heat organ is left to produce large amounts of energy, and the build-up of it reaches a certain level, an explosion of energy will engulf Xeno'jiiva's body. In this state, portions of Xeno'jiiva's body are covered in blue flames, and its strength, as well as the amount of energy it uses, is increased. Xeno'jiiva becomes unstable when it builds up too much energy inside of its body, affecting its mass, so it needs to release as much as possible. Xeno'jiiva is known to become exhausted for a long period of time after releasing so much energy.",
							"Although Xeno'jiiva is already an adult, it's believed that it'll further change as it grows. Scholars in the commission theorize that Xeno'jiiva will lose its transparent skin as it further grows and that it'll be able to generate energy infinitely in its body via its heat organ, meaning it won't ever need to feed on other creatures for subsistence. They also think that Xeno'jiiva could learn to maintain a high energy state permanently over time. Since much about Xeno'jiiva is still a mystery, it's up in the air whether it could become stronger in the future or not.",
							"Xeno'jiiva can attract other Elder Dragons to its location with its immense energy pulses or special pheromones, causing the Elder Crossing to happen every ten years instead of every hundred. This also causes the geography of an area, the New World, in this case, to change constantly from all the natural phenomena, which is caused by other Elder Dragons, going off at once. From it feeding on the bioenergy of dead Elder Dragons for decades, it has gained enough power to be considered the Emperor of Elder Dragons and could bring mass destruction to whole ecosystems if one was ever allowed to leave its nest.",
							"Xeno'jiiva is immediately hostile the moment it emerges from its cocoon, making it dangerous to other species. Although it had just awakened, its powers are already considered to be great compared to most Elder Dragons, but it can't control all of its energy. It's believed that if Xeno'jiiva was left alone to master its powers it would've been {@creature safi'jiiva|MHMM|a greater threat}.",

							"Yama Tsukami is an unusual Elder Dragon with an octopus-like body. It is covered in moss, algae, and other plant life, and boasts a set of four thick tentacles. In addition, it possesses two large whiskers and an oddly human-like set of teeth and gums. It produces gas within its body in order to keep itself afloat.",
							"Yama Tsukami are constantly traveling through different areas in order to find suitable fertile land for them to feed on, even traveling over vast seas. Yama Tsukami is a dangerous monster that can potentially swallow a whole village or town. However it is believed that the winds in environments can send Yama Tsukami unintentionally into some areas so it might not intentionally be heading to attack towns. Though, most heavily forested areas are most at risk of getting eaten by a Yama Tsukami. Strangely around parts of a Great Forest, Yama Tsukami of different colors and sizes have been seen. Its theorized that they are either adults and juveniles, subspecies, or just environmental conditions. Most believe that it is due to environmental conditions that there are many different Yama Tsukami.",
							"Yama Tsukami's most notable adaption is its ability to float with no obvious method of propulsion. From the large amounts of dirt and rotting flesh that a Yama Tsukami has swallowed, it all produces a gas inside its body that allows it to float in the air without wings. It is able to control the amount of gas it uses and able to use it as a rudder as it floats in the air. It can even use the gas as a weapon and as a defensive shield. Despite being able to control it, Yama Tsukami can be knocked out the air if enough damage is done to it and even by crashing into the ground randomly. The creature has four large tentacles that may serve as multipurpose appendages. These tentacles are light yet very slimy It could use these to snare prey, uproot plants, or anchor itself to landmasses or trees. At the end of these tentacles, there seem to be claws. It also uses them like whips when defending itself, crushing anything that tries to challenge it.",
							"Yama Tsukami also has a pair of large whiskers, which it uses as tentacles as well. Yama Tsukami has the parasitic Dragonwood and the mysterious Dragonmoss growing from its back along with trees and many different plants. The exact cause of this is its feeding on forest and on lakes along with its blood which is the nutrients for many different species of plants. Due to this, Yama Tsukami have become a \"special\" environment for some living things such as the {@creature Great Thunderbug|MHMM}. Sometimes as it eats whole forests and lakes, Yama Tsukami will also suck up or eat Great Thunderbugs that are caught in its mouth. From the Yama Tsukami being a \"special\" environment for them, they become quite different from the normal Great Thunderbugs and develop differently compared to them. They even seem to develop a bond with Yama Tsukami and will defend it from any potential threats. Yama Tsukami have incredibly long lifespans numbering in the thousands of years.",

							"The Lagiacrus is one of the most famous and feared Leviathan. A large water monster It sits comfortably at the top of the oceanic food chain. It is the top predator of its habitat, and even predators such as {@creature Rathalos|MHMM} and {@creature Rathian|MHMM} prefer to keep out of its way. Of course being the Lagiacrus' only real competition besides each other, the Fire Wyverns would be considered a threat to a Lagiacrus, as would a Lagiacrus to a Fire Wyvern. Lagiacrus's control of Thunder Element makes it a dangerous adversary in the aquatic habitat it resides, even for the well defended {@creature Gobul|MHMM}. Even {@creature Plesioth|MHMM} that migrate to tropical islands and flooded forests would be wary of the large and powerful leviathan as its powerful electrical attacks can easily cripple or even kill the Piscine Wyvern. This would cause Plesioth to avoid Lagiacrus at all costs. Lagiacrus are known to feed on fish, lobsters, {@creature Kelbi|MHMM}, {@creature Aptonoth|MHMM}, and {@creature Epioth|MHMM}.",
							"Lagiacrus are highly aggressive Leviathans that is the \"Lord of the Sea\". To hunt down and capture prey, Lagiacrus will swim in a circle to form a whirlpool. These whirlpools are used to suck up fish and other prey so Lagiacrus can shock them to death before feeding on their quarry. These whirlpools are occasionally used sink boats and ships.",
							"Lagiacrus is a large, blue aquatic leviathan, adapted to life in tropical waters. When a Lagiacrus is fully sunbathed, it turns a dry grayish-blue color and its dermal spikes turn a pale red. When it returns to the water, Lagiacrus regains a striking deep blue color and its spikes return to their original color of a very light beige.",
							"Its hood-like structure is allows it to swim through the water much quicker along with the help of its tail and limbs. Lagiacrus are able to stay submerge underwater for up to half a day without coming out for air. The large dorsal spikes on its back are used to release its electric attacks alongside a possible electro sac below each spike. Its able to release this electricity by contracting its cells at high speeds inside its muscles. When it does this some of the electricity actually combines with some of the mucus in its mouth, allowing it to spit out lightning projectiles from its mouth. In other regions, the Lagiacrus is able to bend the lightning it creates around it, how it does this is still unknown. It is known to to come ashore to regain its strength after discharging or to rest when it's tired.",

							"Like most other Leviathans, {@creature Mizutsune|MHMM} has a long, slender body. However, it is one of the few Leviathans to actually have fur on its body. This fur covers its chest, underbelly, legs and tail. Its scales are light colored and resemble those of a fish. Its head has a long snout and is beautifully adorned by many fin-like appendages. These fins are pink with yellow markings, and they can also be seen on its back and tail. Its feet are said to be quite different from other Leviathans and allow Mizutsune to move swiftly on land.",
							"Mizutsune's most unique adaption is its ability to produce bubbles. It is able to produce the bubbles by using special fluid secretions, produced from its own body along with water, and rubbing its hairs in the secretions. These stiff yet soft purple hairs are found on its chest, tail, legs, and sides. The hairs are used for sliding on the fluids it produces, spreading the fluids, and even using the fluids to produce more bubbles. Mizutsune can also breath these bubbly fluids from its mouth. It is known to use the bubbles it produces both offensively and defensively in battle. It uses the bubbles to help it move faster and to make it more flexible in battle, while simultaneously impeding the movement of any foes. In order to stop itself quickly while moving, Mizutsune has special hook-like claws that allow it to stop sliding quickly to face threats and not leave itself open. Despite Mizutsune's strange appearance, the fins it has actually act as receptors for detecting the presence of predators and prey coming through vibrations in the secretions. Like a snake, Mizutsune's teeth are recurved to prevent prey from escaping easily. Its jaws are even designed like a snake to an extent, even being able to open its mouth wide and swallow some large prey. It can also fire pressurized jets of water from its mouth, much like {@creature Plesioth|MHMM}.",
							"Mizutsune are rather calm in nature until provoked. They prefer to be left alone resting near large bodies of water, while covered in their special secretions. They prefer to avoid confrontations, however, will defend themselves if need be. Once a threat has left, Mizutsune won't chase after the threat but will instead let it go. Though Mizutsune are usually calm, they are known to turn aggressive during Breeding Season. Mizutsune become aggressive or even berserk during their Breeding Season. In this season, it is not a good idea to go fishing from them being known to injure people due to their blind rage. Male Mizutsune have large fins and are able to flash their fins red to show emotion to the female Mizutsune, in order to attract them.",

It spits sand at predators that try to attack it. Its eyes are on top of its head, so it can see its prey easier when lurking in the sand; however, their placement also makes it difficult for it to see anything directly in front of it. They also have salamander-like \"gills\" which it uses to filter out sand and absorb minerals in the sand. It uses this clearing of the sand as an attack, as the sand shoots from the gills at a high enough speed to hurt individuals caught in the blast. Niblesnarf seem to have very strong stomachs, capable of withstanding a bomb exploding in it. Inside the massive mouth of this predator is an enlarged uvula that stores nutrients.

Due to their capability of living in a number of different environments, Seregios compete with a large number of other large predators. Seregios have also been witnessed aggressively attacking {@creature Rathalos|MHMM} and {@creature Rathian|MHMM} (including their subspecies) and are said to be serious rivals toward them.",
							"The Seregios is covered in extremely sharp Blade Scales. These scales are capable of cutting through the armor of certain prey and flinging them at a distance with good aim. On impact the scales will embed themselves in the victim like shrapnel and can leave complicated gouges in prey and even rocks. The wounds the scales leave behind are extremely painful for the victim and said pain can last for long periods of time, possibly causing infections as well. The most defining trait that this species is that they have Zygodactyly feet like roadrunners and other birds. Seregios are the only species in the Flying Wyvern class that possess them. The feet of these creatures can be used as devastating weapons against prey and enemies alike. A hunting Seregios use their feet to grasp their prey in a vice-like grip giving their victims little hope for escape. When in flight the claws on their wings are utilized for control and to allow them to shift their weight more easily. A Seregios is one of a few wyverns whose flight mobility and control is comparable to a Rathalos. Seregios will also utilize the thick, sturdy blade-like horns on their heads along with their blade-scaled covered tails in combat.",

They are violent fighters and will battle other monsters in order to kick them out of their territory claim it as their own, this includes their own kind in their land. In most cases, the monster they are fighting will end up dead after the battle and while some live on. The bigger the Seregios, the larger amount of territory it needs. Once a territory is gained by a Seregios, it will mark its territory with its own Blade Scales.",

							"Zamtrios is a large, quadrupedal monster with grey-blue skin and yellow fins. It is superficially shark-like in appearance, with a long, pointed snout and a mouth filled with multiple rows of sharp teeth. As the adult form of {@creature Zamite|MHMM}, its limbs are powerful and fully-developed. Its skin is extremely elastic in order to accommodate its inflation abilities.",
							"Zamtrios is a powerful predator, but these Fanged Beasts mostly feed on plants, nuts, and mushrooms though they will sometimes eat meat. From the size of the {@creature Lagombi|MHMM}, its very possible Zamtrios would try to hunt them. Though Zamtrios prefer to feed on smaller helpless prey, they are still quite dangerous in their own right. Zamtrios have even been found to feed on {@creature Plesioth|MHMM} in tropical waters. The massive and aggressive {@creature Gammoth|MHMM} can seriously injure, if not outright kill the Amphibian if confronted.",
							"Zamtrios is a very strange Amphibian with many bizarre adaptions. Zamtrios now lacks the sharp spike its juvenile form has but now is able to produce a type of \"armor\". It is able to produce this armor by secreting a special fluid from its skin that eventually freezes around it forming this icy armor. This armor acts as a secondary protection against threats and also acts as weapon. When it forms this armor, it will also produce a long, rigid spike made of ice on top of its head, replacing the spike it once had, and spike on its tail as another weapon. When its not using its icy armor it will use freezing water to attack threats or prey from a distance and will spit balls of snow at them to stop their movement. Zamtrios have an under layer of skin directly under their skin used to replace previous old one. Their teeth, like saws, cut up prey just by rubbing against them.",
							"When Zamtrios is damaged greatly while it has its icy armor, it will go through one of the most dramatic changes in nature. When greatly damaged, Zamtrios will greatly expand its body and inflate its body to several times its original body size. It goes through this change to intimidate an attacker and is able to do this from gas that it produces from inside its body. The downside to this is that Zamtrios becomes more susceptible to attacks while inflated and its maneuverability is dramatically decreased.",
							"Zamtrios primarily spend most of their time in the water or under ice, constantly roaming around their territory and searching for prey. Like the Zamites, Zamtrios have huge appetites and have a single mind set on finding prey and to kill or eat any intruders in their territory. If Zamtrios have an enemy in their sight, they may actually chase them for miles upon miles of ice. During the breeding season Zamtrios will come together and mate. When female Zamtrios have mated they will then lay their eggs within the ice.",

							"Zinogre is a quadrupedal monster that very wolf-like if one looks at its face, and has a very muscular set of forelimbs - very comparable to those of big cats. It has surprising agility for such a large monster, similar to {@creature Nargacuga|MHMM}. It has sharp claws attached to strong muscular fore-limbs, which are used to deliver a fatal blow to prey and hunters. It also helps them to climb mountains and rocky terrain. The spikes on its body mostly lie flat, but when it has built up an electric charge they stick out vertically into the air.",
							"The Zinogre can also harness the power of electricity, much like a {@creature Lagiacrus|MHMM}, using it to take down larger prey and to defend itself and its territory. Thunderbugs are seen gathering around Zinogre when it is \"charging\" electricity; they may act as a source of energy. Also, {@creature Gargwa|MHMM} are known to eat Thunderbugs, so it is possible that Zinogre has a special relationship with Thunderbugs. As Zinogre preys on Gargwa, Thunderbugs become safe, simply by flying around in close proximity to a Zinogre. Zinogre can exploit this by absorbing the energy emitted by the bugs during battle, granting it special abilities. Thunderbugs might glow blue instead of their normal colour to indicate that they have allied with a Zinogre.If you look close at a Zinogre, you can see a energy field around it. {@creature Juvenile Zinogre|MHMM} have more hair on their bodies compared to adults and is white in color. It is believed that the increased hair protects the juvenile's shell and help speeds up the storage of electricity. This fur will shed as the juvenile Zinogre mature into adulthood.",
							"Zinogre are somewhat similar to real wolves, they even howl like them. But they do not form packs, quite the contrary, they are solitary hunters. This is no surprise, since they are extremely powerful and agile monsters, not needing teamwork to take down prey. According to eyewitnesses adult Zinogre make herds and raise their young. During this period of time it is ill-advised to go hunting Zinogre as the adults will aggressively attack any intruders getting too close to their offspring.",
