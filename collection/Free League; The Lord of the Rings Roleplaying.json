				"Once a Player-hero has proven worthy, they must then demonstrate that they are a skilled archer by spending three days on a solitary hunt in the Chetwood, and returning with a buck of no less than ten points (a {@dc 20} Wisdom ({@skill Hunting|TLotRR}) check; the Player-hero can make two rolls each day, and has three days to complete the task).",
				"After completing this, the Player-hero can choose the Archet hunting bow as their next reward, or replace one of their rewards with it."

While Tolkien used the linguistic differences among the various realms of Middle-earth to good narrative effect, he also found it simpler to avoid steep cultural barriers and gave most ethnic groups (even Orcs and other more fantastical creatures, like Ents) at least a passing knowledge of what constituted a 'lingua franca,' the so-called Common Speech, or Westron. This allows players who don't want to deal with the complex relations between the various peoples and their languages to ignore the entire subject altogether without damaging the setting. But if you are willing to explore this angle, it is certainly worth investigating."

His adventuring has made him wiser and more cautious though, and he often counsels patience and observation as a tactic, versus rash or violent action.",

When the White Council attacked, one such creature was still kept there in chains, dying. Later, it managed to break free and vanish into the darkness, a sworn enemy of any living being."

One summer night, the thing lashed out in fury at several ships anchored near the harbour, dragging them into the depths, along with their crews. Then, it disappeared again. For a while."

Since no one had the courage to face it, Gil-Galad himself had to intervene. Surprised by the steadfastness of the High King and the splendour of Aiglos, his great spear, the thing chose to retreat. With the defeat of its master, the thing regained its free will and fled across Middle-earth."

										"Fans of the literary works of J.R.R. Tolkien have long debated the existence of a consistent canon\u2014as described in {@i The Hobbit}, {@i The Lord of the Rings}, and later publications\u2014that firmly defines the world and history of Middle-earth. This has often been cited as one of the major hurdles to roleplaying games set in Middle-earth, claiming as it does that the Player-heroes' adventures will 'interfere' with the actions of the sagas' known protagonists and 'break' the canon's consistency.",

												"This literary device served Tolkien well as he strove to create a believable 'ancient history' which included the inevitable inconsistencies that arise in a narrative composed by different chroniclers over time, and there is no reason why a Loremaster cannot do the same, especially if there is a need to change an 'established' date or the details behind a known 'fact' or 'historical' figure.",
												"To get an idea of how much the perspective of an unreliable narrator can distort perceptions\u2014and possibly facts\u2014one need look no further than the books themselves. Readers of {@i The Lord of the Rings} often find it difficult to reconcile the image of Gimli, the redoubtable axe-wielding warrior of Erebor, with the Dwarven companions of Bilbo in {@i The Hobbit}, who, captured by Trolls, Goblins, Spiders, and Wood-elves, more often than not end up being saved by their Hobbit burglar."

But that age has passed, and the buildings that once rose along the banks of the lake have been abandoned so long ago that often not even a memory remains. Today, countless broken stones have become little more than a refuge for wild beasts. Sometimes, they serve as lairs for even worse things, creatures that come down from the lone-lands to the north in search of prey.",

In winter, the surface often freezes solid for months, blanketing the entire lake in a white canopy. Fog rolls in from the east, settling across the waters and onto the shores in both late summer and winter, absorbing all sound. This mist rapidly burns off under the summer sun, but lingers to envelop everything it touches once the darker, colder seasons have taken hold.",

Bringing with them the grim determination of those who grew up in the farthest corners of Eriador, these refugees taught their children to survive and endure with little aid from others. This has led to East Row being a bit more insular and less welcoming than the neighbourhoods of other Bree-folk, who have called the town home for hundreds of years. As a further reflection of their unwillingness to abandon their roots, the people of East Row brought with them some of the very stones of their abandoned city to serve as the foundation of their new domain.

Except for on market days, the Green acts as little more than a playing field for local children. Here, they can often be found playing blind man's buff, wrestling, or play-acting at being knights of old.",
																"During festivals and on market days, the Green is filled with tents, stalls, and carts, as Bree-land traders sell their goods alongside rare visitors from the tiny communities of southern Eriador, and even the occasional Dwarf from the Blue Mountains. As much a social gathering as an event for commerce, it is not uncommon to see barrels of Barnabas's Best setup beside long wooden tables, to help keep the thirst of the day at bay. Bree-wardens serve to keep the peace during these gatherings, though they rarely have to do more than settle a contentious negotiation or prevent a drunken brawl started by a reveller who's had one too many.",
																"The day-to-day administration of Bree is carried out from the Reeve's House, which serves as both the town court-house and home to its senior official. The current Reeve is Cole Pickthorn, who, prior to his election, served for over a decade under the previous Reeve and has adopted many of his principles and policies. The Wardens' Armoury, more commonly known as simply the Armoury, is a squat stone building that is officially the headquarters of the Bree-wardens, but is little more than a storehouse for rarely used spears, shields, and helms, kept ready should the town ever face a threat from the wilds outside.",
																"Larger than either of these buildings is the Counting-House. In ancient days, it was manned by a representative of the King, who collected taxes in his name and saw to the proper allocation of funds to the town. Sitting upon stone pillars and rising as tall as even the Prancing Pony, its size hints at its noble past. Now it serves as little more than a drafty hall for brief and inconsequential meetings of members of the town council, who are concerned with little more than small town politics and ensuring their own re-election."

																"The lower slopes of Bree-hill are dotted with stone houses, the living quarters of many of Bree's craftsmen. Blacksmiths, tailors, leatherworkers, and many other skilled tradesmen practice their crafts on the ground floor of their homes, while living on the first or even second storey. It is a tradition among many of the local residents to work in tandem alongside families of Hobbits that typically live and work in the basements of the Big Folk's stone homes. For example, one farmer by the name of John Andrews keeps a crop of Southern Star growing on his hillside land, but rents out space below his home to a small Hobbit family who aids in the curing and preparing of the leaf for sale. Hobbits living under this arrangement are sometimes known as Cellar-Hobbits.",
																"As proud as they are skilled, the craftsmen of the lower hillside come from long family lines that set down roots during the days of the king. Because of this, they often regard outsiders or even other Bree-folk as less cultured or somehow beneath their concern. It is indeed a fact that their homes are among the first ones to have ever been built in Bree. This noble lineage authorises the local residents to call it the 'old town', in contrast to the houses built on the upper hillside\u2014the area they call the 'new town' with a good hint of superciliousness.",
																"At the southern end of this 'old town' is the ancient quarry of Bree, clearly visible as a deep cut into the hillside, the result of centuries of excavations. But the most important landmark in the lower hillside is the Old Town Well. A source of pride to all the Bree-folk, the Well is said to grant luck to any traveller who takes a drink from it before heading off on a journey down the East Road. Given that it's the source for the water used to brew Barnabas's Best, perhaps it's true that there's always a taste of home on the lips of those travellers who partake of this tradition. Many Bree-folk looking for a bit of adventure often gather around the Old Town Well after Market Day is over, hoping to sign on with a caravan of Dwarven merchants either travelling west to the Blue Mountains or, in rare cases, far east to Dale and the Halls of the Lonely Mountain.",
																"So welcome are the Dwarves that bring their trade to Bree, that the lower hillside is home to another remarkable establishment: the Dwarf-house. Overlooking the Well and purchased long ago by a Dwarf from the Blue Mountains, it is now a temporary home for any Dwarf merchants during their visits to Bree. The only permanent resident is Luki, the grey-bearded steward, whose bawdy songs can be heard ringing through the area whenever he hosts young visitors and distant kinsmen."

																"Compared to the lower hillside, this part of Bree is generally less affluent, and its homes more humble. It is an area inhabited mostly by Bree-hobbits, who favour low, one-story houses, fronted by colourful, fenced gardens. The exception to this rule is a large wooden building, the Schoolhouse. A recent establishment, it is open to all residents of Bree, whether Big or Little, and regardless of income. Its costs are covered by taxes taken from locals and tariffs levied on traders\u2014though neither of these is extreme. Because of the existence of the school, nearly all of the Bree-folk are capable of doing simple sums and know their letters. Little beyond these basics is provided, and scholarly pursuits are not common nor particularly encouraged. Even so, it is not uncommon for families from Combe, Staddle, and even Archet to pay an upper hillside family to house their child for a time so that they can receive a \"proper education\".",
																"The upper hillside is also home to the town's largest smithy, which is a squat stone building high on the Hill. Few weapons are crafted here. Instead, the local smith is kept busy with crafting horseshoes, nails, and other day-to-day implements."

The proprietor, who refuses to give his name even to paying customers and is then called simply 'Jack the Forsaken' by most, has no concerns about who enters his establishment, as long as they have silver to spend. Unfortunately, those with coins to pay had best sit with their backs to the wall, lest a patron make quick use of a dagger and relieve them of their wealth.",

Not only did the region once host a Dragon's lair, but its greater part is occupied by the forest of Mirkwood, home to Giant Spiders, Orcs, and other dangerous creatures.",

Smaug, the Dragon who once occupied the Lonely Mountain, was slain by King Bard and the kingdoms of Dale and Erebor were restored. The Necromancer was driven from his fortress of Dol Guldur in southern Mirkwood, and the inhabitants of Rhovanion have new hope for the future.

Long ago, its north-south course joined the kingdom of Arnor to its southern counterpart, the realm of Gondor, running for thousands of miles.

Yet, groups of honest folk endure in small communities, spread thinly along the way. Many of these settlements are composed of a handful of homesteads, populated by refugees from Tharbad and their descendants. Huddling together for protection, they live an isolated existence, leaving their fortified sanctuaries exclusively to trade. They are often glum and taciturn, and may seem concerned only with their own survival in this wild, lonely place.",

So brutal are these terrible beasts that, as if driven to madness, they have even turned their attention to Mount Gram itself and on more than one occasion raided the Goblin tunnels that are still hidden from the sun beneath the stone cliffs of that rocky terrain."

Its highest peak is Mount Gram, a name remembered mostly in songs from the Shire as the domain of Golfimbul, who was slain by Bandobras \"Bullroarer\" Took during the Battle of Greenfields several hundred years ago. In that silent and shadowy region, Orcs, Goblins, and even some Trolls have restored their numbers, now rivalling those of the days when Angmar drove them to war. Though they remain secret, it is only a matter of time before their craving for blood and the will of their master drives them to fall once more on Eriador."
