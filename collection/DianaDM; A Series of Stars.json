						"Hello Everybody! This compendium, \"A Series of Stars,\" is the culmination of over 2 years of homebrewing and playtesting a set of stellar and cosmic creations. Over the course of your jaunt through the following 70+ pages, you'll explore an entire starscape of playtested, balanced, and diverse goodies for D&D 5e. These include 8 options for {@filter races|races|source=ASoS} along with 2 new base races, a {@filter subclass|classes|source=ASoS} for all existing classes (with the exception of Artificer), 24 {@filter magic items|items|source=ASoS}, 26 {@filter monsters|bestiary|source=ASoS}, and the updated {@class Astromancer|ASoS} class.",
						"While all pieces of this compendium are valued and fun, the aforementioned Astromancer is a particular labor of love, comprising of an arcane full-caster class chassis, 6 subclasses, 15 unique spells, a This is Your Life, and 7 of those 24 magic items as class-specific items. We've had dozens of unique playtesters and hundreds of experiences from people playing this class for campaigns and one shots and we couldn't be more excited about all of the responses we've gotten and where the class has ended up.",
						"Everything in the next few dozen pages helps to round out D&D 5e's somewhat sobering lack of cosmic themed content thus far. While Tasha's has helped to address the issue, we hope that this compendium will assist in rounding out this domain in a way you'll use and appreciate, too!",

One may decide to reorient the concepts presented in the prior pages to allow for these creations, regardless.",
								"For example, Realmspace and other canonical Dungeons and Dragons worlds tend to use a system that incorporates crystal spheres, wildspace, and the phlogiston. A DM who wishes to use some aspects of these concepts may conclude that they will keep wildspace, but eliminate the crystal spheres and phlogiston from their canon; making travel to or from any celestial bodies possible simply through space.",

You can work together to create an unconventional way in which a lunar influence still exists in your world. Maybe you utilize the starscape of the Astral Plane as a version of traversable space in your homebrew. You could consider having star-based creations originate from here, instead of traditional space. Alternatively, an issue may arise where there already exists a void or constellations in your canon that do not emulate the designs in this compendium. You may want to simply rename the creations presented. Don't feel bound by the flavor and suggestions presented in the pages above!"

In some interpretations, it is \"emptiness\" or a more abstract \"lack of being.\" In other understandings of this universal (or extra-universal, as it may be) force, it is one of terror; a force that seeks to return all things to the dark nothingness that existed before matter had been conceived.",
								"Some of the beings native to the void, as well as the void's general aesthetic, may bear resemblance to the Far Realm. However, one should consider the varying motivations that the two domains and the creatures native to them possess. Whereas the Far Realm is similarly impossible to understand in its utter madness as the void is, the entities which possess power in the Far Realm do not seek to utterly undo creation as the void does, but rather invade and rule it in their own alien image. These divergent goals implicate a difference in action that the two might take, but a DM may decide that the two have a closer relationship than this section implies."

The starborn do not simply desire to get along with others in order to foster their mercantile habits, but also to slowly build common ground between each world; learning how others live life and then disseminating this knowledge throughout their travels. This practice is based on a cultural tenet which claims that, on a basic level, all people and beings are made of the same eternal elements and should seek to understand each other.",
