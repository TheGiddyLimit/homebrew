At an early age he learned about the dread master of Barovia ruling from atop Castle Ravenloft. It was his fate and the fate of every other Barovian to never leave the mist shrouded valley. The lord of Ravenloft and first vampire, Strahd Von Zarovich, would never allow that.",
					"But Viktor's fate turned out to be different from the rest of his people. Viktor prayed to the Morninglord every day, promising to serve the Morninglord as a holy warrior against Strahd's evil. In his early 20s, when his family was pressuring him to settle down and marry, Viktor's prayers were finally answered, but not by the god that he had been praying to. Two strangers arrived in the village of Barovia. One, named Borivik, would become Viktor's most beloved friend. The other, Lothar, would introduce Viktor to a goddess who would listen to his pleas\u2014the Raven Queen.",

The Raven Queen felt her hold over Viktor slipping, as his friends provided him with love and companionship. So, she sent Viktor a gift: a gold dragon named Thraxis that would be his mount and partner. But Thraxis wasn't a normal dragon; he had been corrupted by the Shadowfell.",

In all cases, abishais are fanatically loyal to Tiamat, ready to lay down their lives if needed.",

Other archdevils can command abishais to work for them, but most archdevils do so rarely, since it is never clear whether an abishai follows Tiamat's orders or Asmodeus's. There is inherent risk in countermanding an order given by Tiamat, but interfering with Asmodeus's plans invites certain destruction."

Sarevok agreed to help Abdel kill Melissan, on the condition that Abdel helped him escape the eternal torments of the Abyss.",

Yet his many accomplishments brought him no joy. He felt no thrill at victory in battle, no delight in the routing of his enemies.

The realization that no earthly achievements could ever compare to what he once almost had\u2014immortality and godhood\u2014left him broken and empty.",

While his divine heritage slowed his aging, it did not stop it entirely, and after decades of self-abuse he was eventually reduced to an old man begging in the streets of Baldur's Gate.",

But even though it was dimmed, Bhaal recognized his own divine spark in the pathetic old man, and he sensed Sarevok still had potential. Bhaal recruited him to become the high priest of his fledgling clergy, giving Sarevok new purpose... and another chance to become an agent of death and destruction."

Appearing in the guise of a humanoid who has previously appeared only in the victim's dreams, the succubus or incubus seduces or befriends its victim, indulging all its desires so that it performs evil acts of its own free will.",

Instead, when a succubus or incubus has corrupted a creature completely-some say by causing the victim to commit the three betrayals of thought, word, and deed-the victim's soul belongs to the fiend. The more virtuous the fiend's prey, the longer the corruption takes, but the more rewarding the downfall. After successfully corrupting a victim, the succubus or incubus kills it, and the tainted soul descends into the Lower Planes.",

With our minds, we will unearth it, we will plumb its depths, and we will annihilate it.\" With those words, the psychically gifted priest Ulmed founded the Ulmist Inquisition, an order of psionic inquisitors that seeks to discover the wickedness hiding in people's souls.",
							"In the days before Count Strahd von Zarovich became the first vampire, Strahd thundered across the lands with Ulmed. Their mission was clear: to destroy the infernal powers that had corrupted the world and to ensure that those powers never rose again. Strahd, Ulmed, and their companions hunted Fiends, Undead, Aberrations, and other supernatural threats and were tireless foes of cults like the priests of Osybus. When Strahd fell into darkness, Ulmed was heartbroken at his friend's transformation and changed the inquisition's mission. Instead of focusing on hunting monsters, it would also hunt the seeds of evil that can corrupt a person.",
							"Ulmed and his friends Cosima, Ansel, and Tristian organized the inquisition into three orders, with each one specializing in a type of psionic power. The Order of Cosima harnessed the Mind Fire\u2014their name for the fire of thought that blazes within each person's mind. They used that power to read thoughts, reshape memories, and dominate the recalcitrant. The inquisitors in the Order of Ansel subjected themselves to harsh asceticism in an effort to use psionic energy to empower their own bodies. They succeeded and became the martial arm of the inquisition, represented by a sword. Finally, the Order of Tristian endeavored to use intellect to alter the environment through telekinetic force, and the order's members became the inquisition's scholars, represented by a tome.",
							"Today the inquisition rules the city of Malitain, a vast city-state to the north of Barovia's original site, and the inquisition sends its members throughout the multiverse, seeking to thwart the work of malevolent cults, otherworldly horrors, and the malice of mortals. The zeal of the inquisitors in this work has caused them to be a source of terror in many communities, where folk fear that an overzealous inquisitor might be as great a monster as the fiends the inquisitors originally hunted."

They call the possessing spirit, as well as the goblin possessed by it, a nilbog (\"goblin\" spelled backward), and they revel in the chaos a nilbog sows.",

Attacking the possessed goblin is foolhardy, and killing them just prompts the spirit to possess another goblin. The only way to keep a nilbog from wreaking havoc is to treat it well and give it respect and praise.",
