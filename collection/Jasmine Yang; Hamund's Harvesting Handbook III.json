He agreed to their terms and ventured into the maze, the gods waiting smugly by the entrance to listen for the signs of his failure. For five days, there was no sign of his return and the gods grew confident in their victory over this mere mortal. On the sixth day however, the King of Hunters limped into view, the bleeding head of the massive stag over his shoulders. Throwing it at the feet of the gods, the King of Hunters mocked them for their pathetic challenge and the supposedly weak creature they had created. Furious at both his victory and his scorn, the gods struck him down with a curse; removing his head and replacing it with that of the stag he had just slain. The anger he felt at their treachery transformed him into a demon and he was thrown into the Abyss where the gods would no longer have to face him again. From his new domain, the King of Hunters, renamed himself Baphomet, the Horned King, and subdue scores of demons under his control until he became a feared Demon Lord.

Supporters of the latter theory hold up the nightwalker's \"anti-heart\" as evidence to support their claim. This antiheart appears to us as a dark, flame-like mote of negative energy nestled in the nightwalker's chest. The origin of its name is the fact that this organ seems to be diametrically linked to the trapped creature that released the nightwalker in the first place, shifting in unison with their own heartbeat and becoming stronger as the trapped creature grows weaker. Like all aspects of the nightwalker, the anti-heart exists only as a dark inversion of life and thus has powerful destructive and life-nullifying properties.",

If that creature dies, this item loses its ability, indicated by the anti-heart becoming noticeably inert and lacking the flame-like wisps that usually surround it."

								"Welcome dear reader to Hamund's Harvesting Handbook Volume 3, written by your favorite harvesting mentor: Hamund Holderhek!",
								"I do apologise for my prolonged absence and the delay in producing this entry in the Harvesting Handbook series. Unfortunately, several events befell me recently that prevented me from finishing this book in a timely manner. These events include, but are not limited to: abduction by the Demon Lords of the Abyss, foiling a Shadowfell incursion, going undercover into duergar society, investigating a spree of curious star spawn appearances, and a rather eventful tea time with a close acquaintance.",
								"But the important thing is that the book is here now, and I must say that it is some of my finest work. Not only have I covered the gamut of newly discovered creatures to harvest, but my travels have brought me into contact with ancient artefacts, more people that need harvesting help, and several new schools of combat and magic that incorporate our venerable art into their practices.",
								"I implore you to enjoy this labor of love, dear reader. The knowledge in this book has been compiled under very trying circumstances, but it is all worth it in the pursuit of furthering our beloved craft. Inside, you will learn how to strip a skulk, melt down a marut, and hollow out a howler! Learn how to craft the spoils of your hunts into powerful weapons, channel the power of fiend lords into artefacts, and even find how to incorporate harvesting into every aspect of your being. Ours is an ever-expanding field, and I am so incredibly grateful to be with you every step of the way.",

This volume covers the monsters included in {@book Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes|MTF}, and as before, features a complete harvesting list for each monster, as well as over 130 new magical items to craft. The rules for harvesting and crafting are unchanged, but this book once again adds several new harvesting related rules to incorporate into your game. Premiering in this book is artifact crafting, a new harvesting related subclass for all 12 original player classes, and instructions for incorporating artificers into these harvesting rules. Everything has been written with balance in mind, but you are of course feel free to rebalance anything in this guide to suit your own table, or feel free to message me at {@link driftersgameworkshop@gmail.com|mailto:driftersgameworkshop@gmail.com} or hit me up on Twitter {@link @drifterworkshop|https://twitter.com/drifterworkshop} to discuss anything in this guide."

These prices are intended as a baseline only, and the DM is free to adjust these values as they see fit for their campaign. The DM is also to keep in mind that, although certain items may have high values, not all vendors may want to buy them. For example, although a Sibriex Frontal Cortex may be worth the high price of 10,000 gp, it may be difficult to sell it to the village grocer.

Duergar use steeder legs to make adhesives and I want to learn more about this fascinating craft. It may seem silly, but I genuinely think that if I can spread this knowledge among my own kin, we can feel just a little bit closer to the cousins we forsook so long ago."

Just one drop of that oil can make miracles happen when applied to even rudimentary machines, let alone my own inventions. Problem is, I'd never be able to get it myself seeing as how dangerous the marut are in battle. If you get me some, I'd pay a high price for it."

						{

								"{@i Q: How come you didn't include any loot like weapons and armor?}",
								"A: Those items are largely context sensitive. After all, not every {@creature Hobgoblin|MM} walks around with a {@item spear|PHB} at all times, so I felt best to leave those out and up to the DM to decide based on context."
