						"The mere idea of having statistics for a deity is already controversial enough\u2014after all, if it can be statted, it can be killed by a foolhardy adventuring power.

						"First, I looked at the precedents. 4th Edition includes separate stat blocks for a deity and its avatar, as well as a discussion of the conditions necessary to truly kill the deity. Meanwhile, 5th Edition gives an outdated CR 30 stat block for {@creature Tiamat|RoT} in {@adventure Rise of Tiamat|RoT} with five legendary actions, CR 30 mythic stat blocks for the aspects of {@creature Aspect of Bahamut|FTD|Bahamut} and {@creature Aspect of Tiamat|FTD|Tiamat} in {@book Fizban's|FTD}, while {@adventure Icewind Dale|idrotf} gives {@creature Auril (First Form)|idrotf|Auril} three distinct legendary stat blocks (CR 9, 10, 11) that she cycles between.",

								"Deities discorporate if you kill them, unless you manage to satisfy certain conditions set by the DM. This means that even if a deity can be bested in combat, doing so won't permanently change the pantheon of the setting."

For the DMs that don't want fightable gods, they can simply not allow the full deity to be fought.

											"On his turn, Tenebrous will generally use {@spell circle of death} to damage multiple party members at once, opting to use Multiattack for single target damage if a particular character is a more urgent threat than the others that round. If his Finger of Doom is available, he uses it to guarantee critical hits with his Claw attacks in melee against a paralyzed victim.",

Tenebrous knows that combat is a game of attrition, and is not afraid of dragging out the fight if it means ensuring victory. The party's best chance of defeating Tenebrous is to lay a trap or to otherwise force a particular choice of arena that leaves Tenebrous exposed with few hiding spots.",

These undead aren't enough to challenge the party by itself, but between Bolster Minions being used to buff them, any other undead that were already present before the battle began, and Tenebrous himself, the undead from this ability can quickly overwhelm the party.",

If this is impossible, he will use Antilife Barrier to deter the party from pursuing him as he attempts to regenerate his hit points. If afflicted with a harmful condition or spell, he may use Consume Energy on any remaining minions, although this comes with the tradeoff of losing another body in the fight that could potentially draw attention from the party. When an opportunity presents itself, he will use Creeping Death to inflict necrotic vulnerability on as many party members as possible, following up with {@spell circle of death} or Grave Bolt as soon as possible."

Over the next two decades, Master Xilian slowly built up the organization, hand-picking members from those who respected (or worshiped) the power of death and undeath. Soon she had a cadre of necromancers, evil priests, and professional killers.",
						"But the Academy was infiltrated by a paladin named Rion, who used his knowledge of the group's inner workings to organize an assault by those who opposed them. Most of the Necromicans (as the Academy's members call themselves) were destroyed, and Xilian herself was on death's door when loyal minions spirited her away.",
						"From the ashes of the Academy's worst failure came its first great success. Unable to repair Master Xilian's horribly broken body, the necromancers instead performed an unspeakable process upon her, turning her into a lich. With a newfound lease on unlife, Xilian swore vengeance upon her enemies. She knew that patience was her ally, and over the next century, quietly built up a secret but powerful organization dedicated to death and evil. Now, the time to strike approaches near, yet she hesitates, fearing the possibility of another setback.",
						"Today, the Academy Necromica prides itself on its strict dedication to evil above petty politics, and thus remains basically neutral evil. Individual members may vary from this ideal, but the Academy itself rarely strays into either lawful or chaotic methods. Symbolic of this ideal is Xilian, the Master of the Academy and a powerful necromancer in her own right. As the organization's founder and most powerful member, Xilian is possessed of a patience born of more than a century of unlife. She does not take unnecessary risks, though she also knows the value of personal involvement in times of crisis. She spends most of her time teaching the students of the Academy, as well as crafting long-range plans for the organization's future.",
						"As one might expect, the Academy welcomes both the living and the dead, and it numbers a few undead (vampires, specters, and the like) among its membership. To join, one must only demonstrate an appreciation for the arts of death, whether that appreciation is scholarly or more... hands-on.",

The characters might come across rumors of a ring of graverobbers or bodysnatchers, which in turn could lead them to discover the Academy's more vile activities. Alternatively, the Academy might target one of the party members as a likely candidate for vampirism or similar undead transformation, hoping that experiencing death will make the character friendlier to their aims. Or maybe one or more characters are aligned with the forces that brought Xilian and her Academy down the first time. If you have a non-good necromancer in the party, the Academy might even attempt recruitment, but only after confirming the character's disposition towards undeath.",
								"It's probably best not to pit the character directly against the Academy at lower levels. The higher-ranking members (such as Xilian or {@creature Uther Kyush|LM}, described below) could certainly defeat a low-level party of adventurers singlehandedly, and neither would hesitate to eliminate a serious threat to the organization."

In this vision, the theurge was tasked with an unholy quest for a terrible artifact: the dreaded {@item Wand of Orcus}.",

He knew instinctively that this quest must remain secret from the world at large, and has thus kept to the shadows, never extending his reach too far. He has enlisted a small group of allies to this cause, including rogues, diviners, and planewalking characters of all stripes. He has also attracted the service of a few {@creature visage|LM|visages}, though in truth he doesn't know why these undead beings offered their allegiance to him.",
						"The truth, should D'Milluhr ever learn it, would likely shatter his sanity. The vision was neither a message nor a divine quest, but merely a quirk of fate, an echo of the thoughts of the undead deity Tenebrous when it came into being on the Astral Plane. The visages came to D'Milluhr because they sensed some connection between the theurge and their creator, Tenebrous. Worse still, the quest itself is a meaningless one, since the being known as Tenebrous has regained his lost wand and returned to his previous identity, Orcus, Demon Prince of Undead.",

He tracks down almost every lead, no matter how vague, which leads him on innumerable wild goose chases across the planes.

It started way back in 2019 when I was working on my {@link Elder Evils 5e|https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-LOB2b05vCsVZ_5ESE8X} conversion, when I noticed that a few of the monsters used there were based on content from Libris Mortis. I looked up Libris Mortis to help with that conversion, and I found myself fascinated by the content within, especially the undead grafts and undead cults.",
										"So, I ultimately decided to do a conversion of Libris Mortis, which I would work on back and forth with Elder Evils whenever I'd get bored of the other. I completed the bestiary, spell lists, and cults, but then I got busy with other D&D homebrew, school, and life in general, so the blackguard, subclasses, and equipment chapters were completed at a snail's pace.",
										"At some point in 2022, I discovered Open Grave, the 4e version of Libris Mortis. This book had a collection of cool monsters and templates that didn't appear in 3.5e, as well as an Undead Hall of Infamy with stat blocks for powerful undead that are well-known in D&D pop culture. I decided to add these to this conversion as well, as I felt that the additions rounded out the document quite nicely.",
										"Of course, this almost doubled my workload, and eventually I decided to cut out the pre-made encounters and the undead variants so that I wouldn't burn myself out. So I eventually managed to convert the Open Grave content, polish up some existing material that wasn't up to my current standards, and then put this together in January 2023.",

								"The Academy Necromica was founded nearly one hundred and fifty years ago by the necromancer Xilian, who sought to establish a place where like-minded individuals could come together and share the secrets of the dark arts. Over the next two decades, Master Xilian slowly built up the organization, hand-picking members from those who respected (or worshiped) the power of death and undeath. Soon she had a cadre of necromancers, evil priests, and professional killers.",
								"But the Academy was infiltrated by a paladin named Rion, who used his knowledge of the group's inner workings to organize an assault by those who opposed them. Most of the Necromicans (as the Academy's members call themselves) were destroyed, and Xilian herself was on death's door when loyal minions spirited her away.",
								"From the ashes of the Academy's worst failure came its first great success. Unable to repair Master Xilian's horribly broken body, the necromancers instead performed an unspeakable process upon her, turning her into a lich. With a newfound lease on unlife, Xilian swore vengeance upon her enemies. She knew that patience was her ally, and over the next century, quietly built up a secret but powerful organization dedicated to death and evil. Now, the time to strike approaches near, yet she hesitates, fearing the possibility of another setback.",
								"Today, the Academy Necromica prides itself on its strict dedication to evil above petty politics, and thus remains basically neutral evil. Individual members may vary from this ideal, but the Academy itself rarely strays into either lawful or chaotic methods. Symbolic of this ideal is Xilian, the Master of the Academy and a powerful necromancer in her own right. As the organization's founder and most powerful member, Xilian is possessed of a patience born of more than a century of unlife. She does not take unnecessary risks, though she also knows the value of personal involvement in times of crisis. She spends most of her time teaching the students of the Academy, as well as crafting long-range plans for the organization's future.",
								"As one might expect, the Academy welcomes both the living and the dead, and it numbers a few undead (vampires, specters, and the like) among its membership. To join, one must only demonstrate an appreciation for the arts of death, whether that appreciation is scholarly or more... hands-on.",

										"Unless you run an evil-oriented campaign, the Academy Necromica probably works best as an adversary for your party. The characters might come across rumors of a ring of graverobbers or bodysnatchers, which in turn could lead them to discover the Academy's more vile activities. Alternatively, the Academy might target one of the party members as a likely candidate for vampirism or similar undead transformation, hoping that experiencing death will make the character friendlier to their aims. Or maybe one or more characters are aligned with the forces that brought Xilian and her Academy down the first time. If you have a non-good necromancer in the party, the Academy might even attempt recruitment, but only after confirming the character's disposition towards undeath.",
										"It's probably best not to pit the character directly against the Academy at lower levels. The higher-ranking members (such as Xilian or Uther Kyush, described below) could certainly defeat a low-level party of adventurers singlehandedly, and neither would hesitate to eliminate a serious threat to the organization."

In this vision, the theurge was tasked with an unholy quest for a terrible artifact: the dreaded {@item Wand of Orcus}.",

He knew instinctively that this quest must remain secret from the world at large, and has thus kept to the shadows, never extending his reach too far. He has enlisted a small group of allies to this cause, including rogues, diviners, and planewalking characters of all stripes. He has also attracted the service of a few {@creature visage|LM|visages}, though in truth he doesn't know why these undead beings offered their allegiance to him.",
								"The truth, should D'Milluhr ever learn it, would likely shatter his sanity. The vision was neither a message nor a divine quest, but merely a quirk of fate, an echo of the thoughts of the undead deity Tenebrous when it came into being on the Astral Plane. The visages came to D'Milluhr because they sensed some connection between the theurge and their creator, Tenebrous. Worse still, the quest itself is a meaningless one, since the being known as Tenebrous has regained his lost wand and returned to his previous identity, Orcus, Demon Prince of Undead.",
								"But D'Milluhr suspects none of this, and remains feverishly intent on recovering the \"lost\" Wand of Orcus. He tracks down almost every lead, no matter how vague, which leads him on innumerable wild goose chases across the planes. He rejects any suggestion that the Wand is in the hands of Orcus himself, clinging to the theory that his shadowy patron wouldn't have bestowed a quest as hopeless as taking the Wand from the hands of the Demon Prince of Undead himself.",

These undead aren't enough to challenge the party by itself, but between Bolster Minions being used to buff them, any other undead that were already present before the battle began, and Tenebrous himself, the undead from this ability can quickly overwhelm the party.",
												"Tenebrous also uses Elude the Living to create hiding spots for himself and his minions to hide, since they are not affected by the magical darkness. If threatened in melee by multiple combatants, he may use Destructive Burst to push them away.",
												"Once both of his mythic traits are active, Tenebrous acknowledges the threat to his continued existence and may flee. If this is impossible, he will use Antilife Barrier to deter the party from pursuing him as he attempts to regenerate his hit points. If afflicted with a harmful condition or spell, he may use Consume Energy on any remaining minions, although this comes with the tradeoff of losing another body in the fight that could potentially draw attention from the party. When an opportunity presents itself, he will use Creeping Death to inflict necrotic vulnerability on as many party members as possible, following up with {@spell circle of death} or Grave Bolt as soon as possible.",

						"The world knows paladins to be shining paragons who champion lofty ideals such as compassion, nobility, sacrifice, and valor. Such virtuous figures are symbols to the common people, icons from which they draw the strength and courage to stand fast against the encroaching darkness. Yet in every light a shadow lurks\u2014the brightness of these noble warriors is equaled by the shadow spreading from their sinister counterparts, the blackguards.",

								"Blackguards are shadow warriors who embrace the power of what most people consider to be a vice or a dark emotion. A blackguard's vice becomes a central focus for that individual's divine power. Dominance, fury, and pride are among the forces that blackguards cultivate to fuel their might.",
								"Because malevolent deities and wicked forces in the cosmos are more likely to hold a vice in esteem, most blackguards are villains. Nevertheless, blackguards who cling to higher ideals do exist. A heroic blackguard might be born when a divine soldier who tries to exemplify virtue cannot control their anger or some other base emotion. Such blackguards are referred to as fallen paladins. Other heroic blackguards cleave to a vice that a non-evil religion or deity promotes as an asset, or they have learned by necessity to turn their negative tendencies into a divine focus so that they can lead productive lives."

								"The power of vice is alluring because it offers fewer restrictions than virtue does. Though the power comes easily, a blackguard always faces the worst temptations of his or her vice, as well as that of other negative emotions that echo the vice. Scruples can be hard to maintain in the face of such a lure. A truly heroic blackguard can never give in and take the easy path.",
								"Heroic blackguards have a hard road to travel. Their truly immoral counterparts form orders that actively oppose virtuous knights and cavaliers. Whether or not a specific blackguard is a member of such a dark order, those same knights and cavaliers rarely understand that a person can channel divine power through a vice without becoming debased. The common people rightly fear all blackguards the same way they fear the black knights of legend. A blackguard who uses the divine power of the dreaded vices to combat evil still has difficulty finding a wide array of allies. He or she rarely enjoys a hero's accolades."

Are you a fallen paladin, or did you gain the power of vice via some other method? Did you find yourself unwillingly consumed by negative emotions, or did you willingly plunge yourself into the shadows? Do you seek some sort of positive change, or do you continue to stray closer and closer to evil?",

Are you an evil-aligned that has fully embraced your dark emotions, or are you good-aligned in spite of them? Do you attempt to control your emotions using a structured, lawful approach, or do you channel them in a free, chaotic manner? If you are neutral along either axis, how do you maintain this balance when the shadows continually attempt to eat away at your sense of self?",

Similarly, if a blackguard completes some sort of quest for atonement, they may be able to make a sacred oath that allows them to replace their blackguard levels with paladin levels."
