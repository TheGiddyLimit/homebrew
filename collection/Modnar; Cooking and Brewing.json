The meat is tough enough to dull typical iron knives, and so many pre-cook the meat in a slow cooker to tenderize it, then grill it afterword. This is also done because the temperatures needed to properly cook the meat is higher than most, near the melting point of iron, and as such it is often cooked in blacksmith's furnaces. However once properly prepared it is a delicious and rich smoky flavor which 'tastes like chicken'. Care is needed in cooking. If undercooked the eater suffers as if they had been exposed to the achaierai black cloud ability. However when properly cooked the eater gains the ability to use the achaierai's black cloud ability once. Multiple meals do not stack, so a creature can only have one black cloud at a time.",

Drink and use with caution. To drink it successfully requires a Constitution Save DC of 18. Failure to meet this immediately puts the consumer into a state of complete agony where they temporarily suffer moderate to large penalties to all attributes depending on how cruel the GM feels like being (and probably how much they tried to drink) and also take physical damage based on how badly they failed. They also gain the Weakened or Petrified condition. If they succeeded in taking the drink, they gain a +10 bonus to Constitution, Strength and Intelligence and also a temporary immunity to fire and poisons whose duration is based on how successful their roll is. (Duration capped at 48 hours.) Both unsuccessful and successful drinkers also end up with a burned tongue and won't be able to taste anything for 1d4 days."
