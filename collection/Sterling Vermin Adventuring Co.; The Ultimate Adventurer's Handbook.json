						"Ratters are short-lived and excitable rat-like humanoids with an insatiable curiosity. They tend to live in close-knit family groups in the sewers beneath large cities, but can be found everywhere they aren't supposed to be able to get into.",
						"Saurians are an ancient race of dinosaur-folk who claim to have once ruled the world. Today, what remains of their empire is in ruins and they must choose between clinging to the traditions of the past or forging a new future for their people.",

These hardships also influence a pugilist in other ways. If you were raised on the street, you might have a special interest in looking after the poor and destitute. If you were jailed for a crime you didn't commit, your relationship with the town guard might be more antagonistic than the average adventurer. Like so many other pugilists, your will was forged in the fires of adversity. What did you learn about yourself when you came out the other side? How does that experience continue to influence you today?",
