To do so, the PCs will have to fly in a hot air balloon or some gnomish sprocket gliders (rudimentary magic-mechanical biplanes) and dog-fight goblins riding giant wasps to accomplish the task."

										"The gnomes of Cogclatter are tinkerers, every one. All are famous (in some cases, infamous) for their inventions. Many of said inventions are no more than curiosities, trinkets, or are outright junk. Though a few are revolutionary, none compare to their massive cloud-schooner airship {@item The Soaring Jabberwock|RolledTold1} (a flying vehicle far larger than any other known airship). Still in the gnomish-try-it-prototype stage of development (meaning they are using it, even though it is untested and most likely will end in disastrous results), a band of gnomes took the ungainly airship for a long-range test flight.",
										"As with most things in the gnomish-try-it-prototype stage, things went badly. The airship began losing height as one of the four balloons that keep it aloft lost pressure at an alarming rate. Being quick-witted, the skeleton test crew managed to put the airship down safely and went about making repairs. Trying to solve the pressure problem, the gnomes opted for using giant floating fungus creatures. The floating fungus creatures, known as gas spores, are easily popped, so to fix that issue, a rather potent adhesive was mixed up. Coating the fungus spores in the protective adhesive would keep the gas spores from bursting when the gnomes herded them to the airship. The adhesive also aided in \"installing\" the glue-treated gas spores inside the original balloon of the vessel. Discovering that their intimal calculations were a few gas spores shy of the needed lift to fly the airship, the gnomes sent a small band to gather the necessary spores. This is where the Deathsting goblin tribe comes into the story. The goblins went to the gas spore caverns for sport at popping the spores without being killed. They found the gnomes as they were leaving with the needed spores. The goblins stealthily followed the gnomes back to the airship. A handful of the goblins stayed to keep watch as the rest went back to gather the rest of the tribe to attack the strange gnomes and their boat. The sizable goblin mob easily took the ship and captured the gnomes. However, as the tribe began looting the ship, one goblin mistakenly cut the airship loose with most of the tribe onboard.",
										"All this misfortune and mischief occurred two weeks ago, and the now-flying goblins have been marauding about the area, attacking, robbing, looting, or just destroying anything that ends up in their flightpath. Being unable to land has done nothing to deter the goblins from utilizing their flying prize. They drop objects-goblins, or, in some cases, livestock-onto targets below them as mobs of goblins slide down ropes or fly down on their giant wasp mounts to overwhelm any travelers, caravans, farmsteads, or small settlements encountered.",
										"During the goblin sky-pirate chaos, the gnomes of Cogclatter have been hard at work on a plan to take back the airship, save the captive gnomes aboard, and spare the countryside from future goblin piracy. The plan they have come up with will require the help of adventurers to pull off and that is where the PCs come in.",
										"\"The Super Heroic, Wildly Witty Jabberwock Aerial Siege Theory Almost Plan,\" as the gnomes call it, will require the PCs, along with a small group of gnomish engineers, to fly a hot air balloon and a handful of prototype magic-mechanical biplanes called Sprocket Gliders to the airship and take it back from the goblins, thus saving the airship, its crew, and the day. Simple, right?"

Even harder for your ringing heads to contemplate, the goblins had a flying schooner. Just as that strangeness sinks in, a roaring clamor of rumbling mechanical sounds and a steam whistle fills the air, quickly followed by a sight even stranger than goblins with an airship. Through a cloud of dust, smoke, and steam, four massive covered wagons\u2014devoid of any draft animals\u2014rumble past at breakneck speed, nearly bowling you over. As you leap to safety, the first massive rumbling six-wheeled monstrosity comes to a grinding, sliding halt directly where you had been seconds earlier, as you are enveloped in a massive exhale of hot steam. Atop the still-chugging mechanical wagon, a wild bearded gnome, bedecked in numerous jingling tools and pouches, squints down at you through his dust-smeared goggles, gives you and appraising nod, and then hoots, \"You lot will have ta do. So no time to dawdle. Clamber on aboard, we got thrill'n heroics at pull off and a whole passle of goblins ta put in their places!\" With a wild series of undecipherable hand signals, the gnome appears to want you to climb aboard the wagon."

If the breakup of the world was slower, perhaps it could've been thwarted. If the palace of Monarch Maripos hadn't been torn in half, killing many of the leaders, maybe the denizens of the world wouldn't have flown into a hopeless panic. Alas, parts of the earth broke free from the rest, drifting up into the sky.",
										"Only those who were already panicked and flexible adapted to the quickly changing terrain. Many of them were shady individuals already accustomed to the ephemerality of rules and laws, and ruthless enough to adapt. And so, the first floating ships were made. Some of the floating islands can be used to lift ships, much like hot air balloons. Others, more innovative, have crafted engines which use processed stone. By extracting the essence that makes the earth float, they give their ships and edge and more maneuverability. Occasionally, chunks of stone float through the many random portals to the Plane of Air. These portals started to show up when the world began to shatter. The stones from the Plane of Air are the best, purest form of fuel, but their potency degrades over time once they're brought to the Material Plane.",

The message was dire: fuel and food supplies were nearly exhausted. The supplies to erect better shelters and a permanent mining camp are desperately needed to ensure surviving the mountain winter.

The two white dragons and their orcs easily bested the six dwarves set as lookouts and took over the {@area Watchtower|D|x} that oversees the pass. The twin dragons have made the broken tower into a lair. Now the young dragons have shut down all trade, having attacked and stolen every wagon, mule, and traveler that has tried the pass. The dragons are never in the same place at the same time, except when in their lair. They have managed to conceal that there are two of them to all, save the dwarves that are captured and held at the {@area orc war camp|C|x}. This means that the PCs will have no clue that Gelidfrost is really two dragons, Gelid and Frost.",

The fifty miners are in bad shape. Until they've all had a good four days' rest with steady meals, they will be little or no help to the PCs in their efforts. Most all the miners have the equivalents of 4 levels of exhaustion (see core rulebooks for details). The prisoners at the {@area orc camp|C|x} (including Orewick's missing granddaughter Golda) are another story. The captive dwarves are badly beaten, but still in fighting shape if freed, fed, and armed.

Normally a double yolk only produces a single living dragon, but because of the foul magic, two dragons were born from the egg. The twin white dragons were mentally and spiritually linked, and far more powerful than other white dragons. The cult took this as a sign of blessing from their dark patron. They foolishly lavished the supposed god-blessed dragons with powerful rituals to enhance their already potent abilities, and that was their undoing. The twin dragons' mental abilities and draconic greed were also enhanced, along with their spell casting. Soon, they would not heed the commands of the cult. The dragons gleefully slaughtered their keepers, stole all the magic and wealth the cult had acquired, and went looking to find their own territory to rule. The newly opened and rich gold mine of the Craghearth dwarves was ripe for the taking. The dragons plan to starve out the miners and to bit-by-bit drain the mountain town of its people and resources, until both can easily be taken without much risk to themselves.

										"Focus attacks on a single target whenever possible, until they are slain. Go for rogues, ranged attackers, healers, and spell casters as quick as they make themselves known. If possible, keep flying to thwart melee combatants. Unless a PC declares an action to attack when something comes within melee range, such combat is made nearly useless. Even when declaring such an attack, a PC still gets only a single swing and not all their attacks. Use the dragon's breath weapon as often as you can. As soon as it refreshes, breathe again, as the damage of a breath weapon far exceeds any other damage the dragon can dish out. Do not spare any target from a dragon's wrath. If a target is unconscious or dying, eat them or stomp them. You are not picking on your players; you are roleplaying a dragon. Every dragon fight should be something a PC is never guaranteed to walk away from. Those that do walk away know they earned their lives and possibly a victory over a heinous foe. If the dragon becomes injured, have it use the {@action Dodge} and {@action Disengage} actions to your advantage, and save attacking enemies for Legendary Actions on their turns to make it harder for PCs and their allies to tie the dragon down to one place.

Creatures without a climb speed move as if in difficult terrain. The dragons dug the tunnel as an escape tunnel from their underground lair. Being fairly cunning and devious creatures, the twins have built in a few means of protecting both the cavern entrance and the tunnel it leads to. Firstly, the cavern and the tunnel are only 10 feet in circumference and barely large enough for the dragons to fit through. The cavern and many places in the tunnel leading to the lair are blocked with 6-inch-thick {@object ice wall|RolledTold5|walls of ice}. The dragons have layered 10 such walls (5-feet worth of thickness) every 15 feet of the tunnel, starting with the cavern and ending 150 feet later where the ice blockage is indicated on the Old Watchtower map. Additionally, the entire tunnel is slick with ice and is graded to form a deadly slide that forces any creature who falls {@condition prone} to start sliding towards the cave entrance at an increasing sliding speed. It begins at 20 feet slide speed and increases by +20 feet every round until the creature or object manages to stop themselves or is launched out of the high cavern entrance.",

When doing something as complicated as combat, the Acrobatics check DC increases to {@dc 15}, made at the beginning of a turn before any action or movement is made (including trying to stand still or take the {@action Dodge} or {@action Help} actions). Once a character or object is sliding, that character or another within reach must use an action to succeed at a Strength ({@skill Athletics}) {@dc 20} to stop the slide. Using a piercing or slashing weapon slammed into the ice as an anchor can grant advantage on the {@skill Athletics} check to stop sliding.

The sections of the floors that remain are sturdy enough to hold the weight of a dragon. The timbers that made up the missing sections of floor are piled, along with boulders and scree, 300 feet below in the excavated cavern lair that the twin dragons have constructed beneath the shell of the Watchtower. The missing section of the ground floor has been replaced with a horizontal {@object ice wall|RolledTold5}. The twins wall off the openness to safeguard the one who is asleep below. They easily shatter the ice to switch guard and slumber position, whereupon the dragon headed to bed remakes the ice wall using its breath weapon before retiring to sleep on the hoard.

The dragons will hurriedly consume as many of the healing potions as possible. One dragon will use a ready action to fight any foes that come down into the lair.

Since the twins are linked and are now considered legendary, they are twice as dangerous as any single dragon. But since they share a pool of hit points (though they have their own stat blocks and actions), PCs are not trying to defeat two separate dragons. Nevertheless, the duo is going to be a very challenging fight for characters of the PCs' level. Because of this, the treasure reward has been doubled from what a single dragon would have acquired.",

A vicious creature slaughtered her father when she was so young she almost couldn't remember. But she had just been Crina then. Her title came after, and came with its own share of cruelties. It began when somehow, every morning, she was too weak to rise out of bed. The condition worsened. Soon she thought she would be free of the cruelty of living without a father's love as she lay bedridden and dying of what was deemed a plague. Another kind of plague took her younger brother, Dalibor, next. It snapped his neck like a twig and drank him dry, but only to have a chance at Crina. Had her brother not tried to defend her from the vampire, he would have been spared. But he did not want to give her up to a vampire as the rest of the village had. To the villagers, what was one sick girl, compared to dwelling in fear each night? But when Crina met him, Count Jarek Kilcos was not cruel, but gentle. He did not drink her dry and leave her blue-white corpse as a warning to the village. He did not snap her neck, as he had with her brother. No, the Count embraced her and gave her his gift in such a gentle kiss she barely felt the pain.",

She ran from the blazing manor and away from the village, vowing that one day the folk of Raven's Rest would bow down to the name of Kilcos once more. Though this time when they bow, it would be to a Countess, instead of a Count. And unlike them, she would not be cruel, but merciful.

The village has the only inn within several days' journey and is one of the last places to stop for basic supplies if crossing the mountains in this region, so it sees more than its fair share of visitors. Most visitors do not stay long, as the place and its folk seem to be perpetually sour and gloomy. There is little or no mirth, but most are extremely tight lipped about the reasons for the mood of all the village folk. Most of the action in the adventure takes place in the ruins of the old manor house, which has once again become the lair of a vampire and her minions, though roleplaying and investigation take place in the village. If the PCs are made aware of the vampire's control of the region and try to leave, packs upon packs of wolves will drive them back to the village, where they will either become servants of the vampire or be made examples of what happens to those that would leave and be slain. It may seem odd, since they were just trying to leave, but Countess Crina Kilcos was less than sane before she was made into a vampire and lost the only man she had ever thought she loved, so she could never let any adventurers that may know about her escape, lest they return and do to her what they did to her beloved Count Jarek.",

The PCs are safe from attack int he village during the daylight hours, though not in the wooded hills outside the village, where the wolves stalk (see {@adventure At The Mercy of Her Pack|LadyLasingKisses|3|At The Mercy of Her Pack} sidebar).",
										"If you need tips on how to run the villagers of Raven's Rest, think of village folk as if they were in an enemy occupied town that was always being watched, Most or all the folk either fear the vampire and her minions and are just trying to avoid trouble and keep to themselves, or they are informants that will turn in whatever happens in the village to the Countess and her minions. Most of those not already loyal to the vampire don't know which other villagers are loyal or what animals are under her control. It is rumored that the Countess, \"The White Lady\" as she is called by some, can control the hearts of beasts and see through their eyes. All the village folk know is that they are trapped, and any villagers who have tried to leave in the past either had their children taken, were slain and risen as {@creature zombie||zombies}, or turned into {@creature vampire spawn} and forced to drink one of their loved ones as punishment. So it will take some digging and convincing for the PCs to fully uncover the truth and not make the vampire aware of their plans.",
										"Most folk are curt, standoffish, or very sheepish if they have to interact with an outsider. The inn and any general services or trade are always fair, but far less than welcoming. The only reason anyone would stop here at all is because of its being the last place for supplies within several days' journey and the only inn for twice that distance\u2014though, a warm, dry bed, a taste of ale, and a hot meal are not so enjoyable when provided only with the minimal of sour-faced grunts and interactions."

You could work on some {@skill Religion} Tests that unveil some iconography to an evil god or death cult.

Or, the cleric finds the zombies gathered around and inside an old mausoleum and the PCs must drive off or slay the zombie horde\u2014which is far larger than they thought\u2014to gain access and destroy the object that is causing the dead to rise. Drive the point home that without the cleric, the situation would be even more dire. It not only bolsters the cleric player, but lets the others know how valuable it is to have them around. Also, a horde of zombies gives all the PCs something to hunt down and battle. It might even grant the wizard a chance to aid the ritual and investigation.

										"That was a real game that my buddies and I played when we were in college. It was long enough ago that we were still calling it \"Advanced\" (albeit 2nd Edition) to differentiate it from box sets and races that were indistinguishable from classes.

If you hit again, you got two damages to apply. If you missed with the confirmation roll, you only did one damage. But if you rolled a 20 on your confirmation roll, you got an additional confirmation roll... and so on. Theoretically, you could keep rolling 20s and keep stacking additional damage rolls atop each other. And that's exactly what I did.",

I did so much non-lethal damage, against what was essentially an {@creature orc}, that I killed him.

										"As far as I was concerned, it changed the way I looked at my character. When I rolled my character, making unarmed combat one of his traits wasn't what I was looking for, but now it fit. My character was sort of the anti-Aragorn; he was of royal blood but his forebears were more tyrannical than noble, so he'd become a bandit. Making him a brawler was the missing piece that character concept needed.",

It wouldn't have happened without that critical hit...",

IT's just a regular old double damage system: Double your damage dice, but not your modifiers, and you're done. It's not special, it's not something to look forwards two... but at least it's there. But the game has no critical miss system.",
										"As far as critical misses, or critical fumbles as they were called then, 2nd Edition barely does anything with them, and 5E does nothing with them at all. I'm convinced they're as crucial, and fun, as a good critical hit system. Like critical hits, critical misses create moments.",
										"In the above example, I never would have thrown the punch had I not rolled a 1 and gotten my sword stuck in the tree. The critical miss created an obstacle for me to overcome. It forced me to think about something besides swinging my sword, my go-to move.

Does extra damage include bonuses like strength or magical bonuses, conventional wisdom says no... a critical hit doesn't mean you got stronger or that your sword got more magical. But you do you. Does a character get advantage or disadvantage on the confirmation roll? Again, I'd say no, but that sounds like a situational consideration to me.

It makes more sense to knock oneself {@condition prone} (or {@condition unconscious}!) than simply to do damage to oneself. Or maybe the encounter has a goal, and the critical miss moves the party a step back from that goal. As far as stacking goes, you can worsen the condition, say from {@condition incapacitated} to {@condition unconscious}, or you can add to the duration of the condition, say from one round to {@dice d4} rounds."

Because of all a GM has to do during a game session, sometimes you miss that the game is lagging, your players' attentions are wandering from the game, or it is just downright boring.

That way, you don't have to give the old \"You guys might want to rethink this\" line. Just give them a taste of what's to come and let them make the decisions. Just because players are 2nd level, doesn't mean that every path they choose has a balanced encounter awaiting them to best. {@creature ogre||Ogres}, giants, {@creature orc} tribes, and dragons have to live somewhere. In a living world, it sometimes behooves characters to run, instead of fight. This way, you can slaughter them with a clear conscience and a \"What did you think the ogre meant by 'Me mates is gonna eat ya fer dis,' that he bleated before he died?\" or a \"Nobody forced you guys to charge into a cave you knew had ogres in it without scouting it out first.

For crusty old gamers like myself who have been rolling funky shaped dice and scratching crazy Gygaxian dungeons on graph paper since I was ten in 1981, Gauntlet showed me (to my players' chagrin and joy) that tides of enemies rolling towards you cannot only be cool, heroic, and fear inducing, but a needed component of my game.",

He gives a tide of goblins along with their pet cave troll in the Mines of Moria scenes. We see our beloved heroes\u2014backs to the wall, weapons at the ready\u2014and a cave troll comes crashing into the tomb, a tide of rabid goblins in tow! If that doesn't blow your hair back, how about a mass horde of Uruk-hai orcs flooding through the hilly forest bellowing \"Find the Halfling!\" The battles are in-your-face furious, wild and glorious action.

												"Plus, it's kind of a fun reveal with unexpected ramifications around the table: When the Game Master shows the image of the tyrant's daughter to the group, one of the players realizes it's one of his romantic gallery images, and so knows to roleplay that immediate (possibly dangerous) sense of being smitten in whatever way is appropriate to his character."

										"Gaming manuals. Miniatures. Dice. Custom gaming tables. Snacks. Drinks. Pizza. Rolled & Told. Tabletop gaming is an incredible hobby\u2014and incredibly expensive. I don't think I've ever stepped foot in a gaming store without blanching at the prices for flashy RPG supplies and paraphernalia. A dice bag costs how much? I have paper bags at home that do the job just fine, thank you. (I promise you that the dice don't care whether they're carried in plastic or vellum.) Whether you are in middle school or about to retire, there is no reason you can't play these amazing games. Your group's enjoyment of the game has nothing to do with how much you spend.",
										"If you are trying to run a campaign for the first time, the shopping list is overwhelming. Some of us don't have that kind of disposable income, but it doesn't have to impact your gaming. You can be the Game Master of a fantastic campaign without spending a lot of money. It just requires prep, creativity, and a lot of stolen office supplies.",
										"I first learned to play tabletop role-playing games with an outdated player's handbook that was missing the cover. I'm pretty sure one of my friends found it in a yard sale. We were all kids, so our resources were tied exclusively to birthdays and holidays. Every new expansion book required us to pool our money together, and we had to look for spare change just so we could photocopy character sheets. More often than not we went without rather than having a miniature that actually resembled our characters. The Wizard with the Missing Arm had to double as the Rogue, the Psionicist, the Owlbear, and even the Gelatinous Cube. We erased the names and stats on the character sheet over and over again until the entire paper was smudged gray on both sides. Somehow, we made it work. You can too.",
										"Gaming manuals are a big investment in playing these games. Some groups have access to multiple rulebooks, but for most of my life players shared a single copy of these sacred texts. Thankfully, that is now less of an issue because: The Internet. Most modern game systems have the rules for character creation posted on their websites. In addition, game designers and players have made incredible resources to reference and search for specific rules. At my table I try to use the books as little as possible. I encourage players to design their own prestige classes or modify an existing power or feat to better suit their characters (within reason). I also challenge myself to come up with original monsters whenever possible. If there's a monster I want to include in an adventure but don't have access to their real stats, I make it up and nobody ever notices.",
										"A resource that is surprisingly helpful for gaming manuals is the public library. More and more libraries are stocking their shelves with gaming lore and rulebooks. Libraries are also always always looking for suggestions on what titles to order. A few recommendations from you and your friends will go a long way, and save you, potentially, hundreds of dollars in books. Obviously, you can't keep the books forever (overdue library book fines are $$$), but at least you'll be able to photocopy selections of the most referenced pages of the rules.",
										"Speaking of, a lot of players simply cannot host a game. Between families, roommates, and small apartments, having five or more friends over might be impossible. Hipper cities have options like game cafes, but those often require a cover to enter or a food/drink order minimum. Libraries and schools are an excellent option. Many libraries regularly host game nights, and if yours doesn't, it doesn't hurt to ask. Someone at your local library is in charge of events like story times or study room sessions or adult education classes. Talk to them.",
										"Students also have other public spaces where they can game: namely classrooms. In my younger years, my friends and I routinely played in one of our chemistry teacher's rooms. Teachers work super hard and have to stay late every day. Take advantage of this by asking your favorite teacher to let you run some games there. The risk here is that if your teacher is cool enough to let you run RPGs in their classroom, they might want to join in.",
										"Gaming materials are a huge expense of playing these games, but they shouldn't have to be. Maybe my most controversial gaming opinion is that miniatures, maps, and dice aren't worth the effort. I appreciate the beautiful sculpts, the time-intensive and detailed painting, and the power of a 1/60th scale fantasy realm.",
										"Sadly, my apartment is too small to properly store a fantasy realm. I've resorted to using different-colored dice to differentiate characters. It's terribly clunky, yet effective. The best part of these games is Theater of the Mind, not exact recreations of every environment the game's characters will inhabit. Players have to use their imaginations and follow your lead as they inhabit these fantasy worlds. Simple drawings and describing the area in detail are all that's needed, really. For an effective, thrifty game master, less is always more. The newest miniature is only going to be impressive for so long. Players will remember the stories you all told together, rather than how cheap and boring your set-up was. Focus on gameplay over geography. You will be forgiven\u2014even rewarded\u2014for playing to your strengths. Your value as a Game Master is almost entirely contingent on your imagination and your friendships with the players.",
										"That is why I rely on the most important weapon in a Game Master's arsenal: paper! There's nothing hundreds of dollars in miniatures and maps can do that a few scraps of paper can't. At the beginning of a campaign, make your players draw small drawings of their characters. (Then when they complain about not being able to draw, have them beg the most talented artist in your group to do it.) The uses for notecards and sticky notes alone are infinite. Make a lazy jigsaw puzzle to reveal an important clue or give players sticky notes to represent an important item. They will stick those little slips of paper onto their character sheet with pride. It's much more tactile and fun than simply adding another line of text to an equipment list.",
										"You can make folded, simple paper standees that work just as well as pewter. It also helps Game Masters who prefer to improvise: There's no prep required. However, if you're going to draw every character and environment as your players encounter it, make sure you're quick about it. This builds into a hand-tailored style of running the game that helps players take ownership of your story. Campaign after campaign, adventure by adventure, I've been able to draw a full war-chest of settings, characters, monsters\u2014even props. The best part is that they all fit in a single folder and aren't low-key embarrassing to carry around on the bus.",
										"If your group prefers something more literal for its gaming tools, a sheet of cheap, clear vinyl over grid paper is excellent and very affordable. You can get that pretty cheaply from a craft store. It's very quick to set up a scene like this for your players, and it's easy to clean up. Just keep in mind that dry erase markers run out of ink fast if you're changing locations and maps often. There's also a lot to be said for raiding an old game closet or garage sale for makeshift gaming materials. A checkers board is perfectly functional as a grid square, and there are no shortages of d6s in the world. The other, more bizarre dice are a different story, however.",
										"Fortunately, cell phones have made physical characters sheets and even dice obsolete in a lot of ways. While I prefer the sound of my tabletop getting cut up by dice, random number generators or free gaming-randomizer apps also work. And don't worry about players modifying the outcome of their rolls by using their tech savvy. Some players are going to fudge the numbers regardless of whether they are using a phone or actual dice. Just accept it. Digital character sheets are a good tool for newer players and very functional. I'm old-fashioned, so at my table I prefer paper because it's easier to keep track of a player's progress. Even though digital solutions may save you some money, be careful. You should try to keep your players' attention away from their devices as much as humanly possible. Once you lose that battle, you'll never get that turf back.",
										"One of the greatest unplanned costs of hosting a game night is food. Even if your friends pool their money to pay for take-out, it gets pricey if you are running a regular weekly session. A group of six players can blow through a bag of chips in under a minute, so you often have to buy snacks in bulk. If your friends like to drink while they play (mine sure as hell do), it's even worse. Many of us were raised to be generous hosts, perhaps to a fault. There's no shame in asking the players to turn each session into a potluck! Or, if you're uncomfortable asking people to chip in, schedule the session after lunch or after dinner so that there's no expectation to raid your pantry.",
										"All of this advice is just to let you know that, hey, money is in no way required to enjoy tabletop gaming. These things are designed to be flexible. Running an entire campaign might not fit in with your work schedule, and that's fine. The best, most innovative role-playing games are available for free online. And many of them are designed as one-offs. There are no rules as to how often you have to play. Yes, there are hardcore gamers who play multihour sessions every single day, but the rest of us have to work. Especially as you get older, a regular session might not be an option, given the time required. No matter how often you play, or with what kind of gaming supplies, maximize the fun.",
										"Work within your own means. Your players will know if you're stressing out over something, and that ultimately hurts the game. This is a hobby like everything else, so don't go overboard in trying to mimic the lavish set-ups you see online. Their tables may be more elaborate, but in no way does that make them better. Your friends won't judge you for the elder ice dragon you made from paper-towel rolls and duct tape. In fact, they'll love you for it.",
										"A savvy Game Master is efficient in using their time, their energy, and their finances. Then you can use all that saved cash and spend it on something truly worthwhile, like loot boxes for your favorite video game."

								"For all the dragons and spells, the worlds of roleplaying games are strikingly familiar. Gravity pulls things down. Adults grow from children. Fire is hot. These rules mean we can make sense of the fantastic worlds by looking at what's different: mischievous fairies, magic swords, vast underground megastructures. But even these fantastic traits carry a sort of mechanical logic and familiarity. A {@spell fireball} spell may never exist in the real world, but your wizard always knows when they expend that 3rd-level spell slot, they get a 20-foot radius cyclone of fiery death. But those fantastic elements\u2014the altered laws of physics, the in-world legends, the bizarre\u2014are what catch our attention and draw us in.",
								"The bizarre is unexpected, strange, or even a funny way the game world differs from what we expect. Small bits of the bizarre\u2014magic, monsters, or spaceships\u2014all help a setting stand out from our everyday world. But they are almost mundane to anyone who has spent a lifetime watching TV, reading books, and listening to fiction podcasts. Bizarre is where your world breaks its own rules for what is and isn't normal, and when used thoughtfully, it can reignite a sense of wonder.",
								"Adding elements of the bizarre to your game can be a fun way to flesh out the world, build myths or urban legends, or take a momentary break from the normal tone of your campaign. Because the bizarre is often a matter of description rather than major rules changes, it's rarely even that hard once you learn a few key lessons. Many players love a game where the bizarre takes center stage for an adventure, or for the whole campaign, but knowing how to write it means understanding what makes something bizarre and when to use it.",

Change for the sake of change is wackiness, and it can be fun\u2014especially if you plan an adventure in a plane of chaos\u2014but humans are pattern-seeking creatures and like to know some reason lurks behind the unreasonable. Writing the bizarre means change, but with rules. Those rules can be obscure or counterintuitive, but you need at least some cursory guidelines. There needs to be some order, or reason, or internal logic, if only so the players know things are going badly when you break the rules later.",
										"One of the best ways for showcasing the bizarre elements of your world is through contrast. One dot of color stands out brilliantly against a muted background, and likewise a lone strange element in an otherwise familiar situation\u2014especially if no one else seems to notice it\u2014seems far more unsettling and important than a firehose of random changes and oblique references. Likewise, adding some element of the mundane to a magical or supernatural element draws more attention to the rest of the strangeness. Maybe goblins in one adventure\u2014a very familiar monster\u2014have enormous secondary mouths in their stomachs, which speak an alien language and seem far smarter than the goblins themselves. Why? That's for you to figure out, but even if you never explain it, it adds an unsettling twist to something familiar to your players. In the other direction, taking your players to a psychedelic dimension of dreams might be fun, but adding an NPC who dresses and acts like a bored retail worker grounds the experience in something familiar, and makes both the dream world and the NPC seem weirder by the contrast. Consider what the rules are in your setting, follow them to their extremes, and then figure out a way to make your players interact with these unusual edge cases. Consider the {@spell fireball} spell: hold out a pinch of bat guano to create a ball of intense heat. Where does that heat come from? Does the spell open a momentary portal to an elemental plane? Could strange things try to slip out every time a {@spell fireball} spell is cast? What if there's a powerful, ancient fire elemental or genie that created the {@spell fireball} spell and gave it to humans as a means of escaping one tiny piece at a time? Or consider the bat guano\u2014where does it go? And why guano? Is there a demiplane somewhere that collects the material components from spells as a sort of cosmic tax on magic? And if so, does that mean there are demiplanes filled with more valuable components, like the onyx from {@spell create undead} spells?",
										"Consider whatever strange element you want to bring into your game and what rules apply to it. How do the PCs interact with it? What happens when they question it or try to learn more? What happens when they start rolling dice? Don't keep the bizarre completely out of their hands\u2014if you do, your game becomes a lecture\u2014but make sure they know that mastering this bizarre element isn't as easy or straightforward as they may think."

But then you have Who Framed Roger Rabbit, a gritty detective movie that also applies cartoon logic, showing us that there are fuzzy edges to any audience's suspension of disbelief, and those fuzzy edges are where you can play.",

If you want an adventure that defies all the normal rules, put it in another dimension where they already expect the rules to change.",
										"If you don't want to introduce your bizarre elements in connection to those areas where the PCs have already suspended their disbelief, you can mimic the process many science fiction or supernatural television shows use to introduce their fantastic element. The introduce the element slowly over many episodes, letting audiences adjust their suspension of disbelief a little at a time. Lead your own players away from normal one step at a time. Start with a simple change from the status quo, such as rumors of a new monster, fantastic locations, or a minor magic effect they can't identify or reproduce.

It's even more important to notice what elements make them check out or start cracking jokes. Like many story elements, bizarre elements feel more welcome and believable if you drop hints to your group early on. Use NPCs and world lore to spell out not only the rules of your world, but also to foreshadow the creepy times when those rules are broken. If you want an adventure in an Escher-esque world, start a few sessions earlier with a bard spinning campfire tale of a cursed artist who sought literal immortality through their works. If your players find the story interesting, you can feed them a bit more; perhaps the mayor's ancestors vanished mysteriously when they crossed a traveling artist.

The dead must win at least one game to move on, or slowly decay into dust, but if they can double their stake they can return to the living. In this scenario, a {@spell resurrection} spell wouldn't bring a dead adventurer back, but instead let the living join them in the casino and play on their behalf\u2014the diamond spell component serving as their ante.

The {@spell maze} spell tosses its target into an extradimensional maze for up to 10 minutes and requires an Intelligence test to escape\u2014easy enough for a studied wizard, but frustrating for an action-hero fighter. If the maze is instead inside the spellcaster's mind, then the trapped fighter might run into different, hostile aspects of the wizard's psyche, either battling or roleplaying with them to distract the spellcaster or impose penalties back in the real world. In this scenario, the trapped player still contributes to the adventure, even if they can't win the day single-handedly, and the spell's challenge doesn't feel so hopeless! You can apply this idea to other effects where a failed save leaves a PC incapacitated for minutes or hours. Perhaps a medusa's petrifying gaze launches a character's soul into the Elemental Plane of Earth where they can try to beat elementals at riddle games.

										"Since 1977, many a player has faced the icy breath and gnashing jaws of the {@creature winter wolf}. This white, adventurer-eating critter has made (as far as I know) an appearance in every edition of the world's most popular RPG since its creation. In its current incarnation for 5th edition, this large-sized monstrosity comes in at a respectable Challenge 3 (700 XP). I mean, that's pretty realistic for 8 feet long, 4 feet at the shoulder, with an average of 75 hit points and the ability to breathe a 1 5-foot cone of 4d8 cold damage. Add in that it understands both Common and Giant, has Pack Tactics, and is kind of sneaky (Stealth +3, with advantage in snowy terrain), and your PCs have a rough foe to deal with. Think if it is not one, but a pack of 6-10 of these nasty critters coming at your favorite second tier (levels 5-10) party of adventurers\u2014now that's a challenge.",
										"Winter wolves are a super versatile monster that work great for first tier (levels 1-4) and even third tier (levels I I-1 6) play, as well. At low levels, a lone winter wolf can make for a nasty mini-boss fight or an even worse random encounter. At higher levels, the winter wolf becomes the servant, fodder, or ally monster for more powerful foes. Winter wolves serve the role of hunting hounds and guard dogs for frost giants. They make powerful minions for an evil wizard or sorceress. They also make great side quest encounters for single PCs of third tier levels.",
										"If you need inspiration, look no further than the movie The Grey, starring Liam Neeson. Switch out the wolves for winter wolves and switch out the oil pipeline for a trade route and send the PCs hunting. You pretty much can mirror most of the scenes in the movie and have a nasty adventure (just change the plane crash to a wagon crash). So, watch the movie and consider it enjoyable GM homework for using wolves, worgs, and winter wolves on their own as foes for your PCs.",
										"Let us get to tweaking for winter wolves. As I stated earlier, the 5e, Challenge 3 version is pretty good to go as is. But we can do some simple things to surprise your well-read or experienced players. The simplest is to add an Alpha wolf (or two, if you are feeling really nasty), if you are using a pack of winter wolves.",
										"An Alpha is just a cut above the average winter wolf. To make something an Alpha on the fly, just give it max hit points instead of average, and give it +2 AC and +2 bonus on all d20 rolls. If you have time to throw a new stat block together, you just need a few stat bumps. First off, a bump up in natural armor (l mean, being the pack alpha is a tough job). Next, give your Alpha a Hit Dice and challenge increase. You can also add in a new ability, plus up the damage and recharge of the Alpha's attacks. If you do all that, you get the stat block below, as an example.",
										"{@creature Alpha Winter Wolf|RolledTold6}",
										"Let's try another tweak. If you are looking to use a lone winter wolf for, say, a random encounter for second tier PCs or as a solo monster for first tier PCs, then you might go with a winter wolf that is the lone survivor or has been shunned or outcast by their pack. Maybe the outcast lost a battle for pack leadership? In nature, when such occurs, most animals either die, join a new pack, or form their own new pack. The rare few that don't and still manage to eke out survival become quite fierce and savage. Such a winter wolf would make a great side quest for a second tier PC or party, or a whole adventure for a first tier party.",
										"Think about this: What seems to be a pack of massive wolves has been slaughtering any travelers who dare to try and traverse the foothills and low trade trails of a mountain range during winter. The wolves only slaughter livestock and draft animals, but never eat them. They also leave no trace of any humanoids. The PCs are brought in to find and slay these menaces. Now the PCs get to try and figure this very un-wolf-like behavior out and track down what happened to the missing humanoids. When they track down the wolf den, they find the place carpeted with humanoid bones. They also discover there is only one very nasty, scarred, and feral winter wolf!",
										"For this tweak we can just take the Alpha and make a few easy changes. Take away anything to do with a pack, give it some solo abilities, and if you are feeling frisky, make it a Legendary Monster with some Legendary and Lair actions. That is the easiest way to make a single foe feel like multiple foes, and most players hate it when a monster does actions on PCs' turns.",
										"{@creature Feral Outcast Winter Wolf}",
										"Now looking at this outcast, it is a very powerful combatant for Challenge 5, but this wolf is alone. This means all the PCs' attacks and abilities will be focused on it. The outcast does not have any great saving throws, and besides the cold breath, it is a melee fighter. Speed 50 ft.",
										"So beating it only takes trapping it or keeping it at range. The Army of One ability makes that tough, but Mental-based spell saves will end the outcast. Also, all damage except Cold Damage works on it. One ranger with a long bow and one of the nastier ranged weapon feats will whittle away at the outcast's Hit Points in only a few rounds. If that ranger has at least three buddies, then the fight will be fun and interesting, but likely not go any way in the outcast's favor.",
										"This is what you want when tweaking a monster. Make it a surprise to your players. Let the tweaks make the combat or encounter interesting. Last, but not least, make the monster beatable. In the end you want the PCs to win. You just want to rough them up and worry them while they do."

Through dark rites and foul rituals, they tried to birth a two-headed dragon to bend to their will and service. Little did the cult know, the dragon egg had a double yolk. Normally a double yolk only produces a single living dragon, but because of the foul magic, two dragons were born from the egg. The twin white dragons were mentally and spiritually linked, and far more powerful than other white dragons. The cult took this as a sign of blessing from their dark patron. They foolishly lavished the supposed god-blessed dragons with powerful rituals to enhance their already potent abilities, and that was their undoing. The twin dragons' mental abilities and draconic greed were also enhanced, along with their spell casting. Soon, they would not heed the commands of the cult. The dragons gleefully slaughtered their keepers, stole all the magic and wealth the cult had acquired, and went looking to find their own territory to rule. The newly opened and rich gold mine of the Craghearth dwarves was ripe for the taking. The dragons plan to starve out the miners and to bit-by-bit drain the mountain town of its people and resources, until both can easily be taken without much risk to themselves. Finding the orc tribe was just a bonus, in entertainment as well as serviceable minions."

Each place that Gruumsh wanted had already been claimed. The other gods laughed at Gruumsh, but he responded with a furious bellow. Grasping his mighty spear, he laid waste to the mountains, set the forests aflame, and carved great furrows in the fields. Such was the role of the orcs, he proclaimed, to take and destroy all that the other races would deny them. To this day, the orcs wage an endless war on humans, elves, dwarves, and other folk.",

It makes more sense to knock oneself {@condition prone} (or {@condition unconscious}!) than simply to do damage to oneself. Or maybe the encounter has a goal, and the critical miss moves the party a step back from that goal.
