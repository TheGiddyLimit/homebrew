The light surrounds you for 1 minute, until you dismiss the effect as a bonus action, or until you fall unconscious or die, at which point the shield rematerializes on the ground at your feet or into your hand if you have one free. If your holy symbol is emblazoned or attached to the shield, it floats prominently amidst the shards of light and continues to function as a spellcasting focus. Undead creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls made against you while you're surrounded by the light in this way. The surrounding shards of light cast bright light in a 20 foot radius and dim light for another 20 feet. Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until the following dawn."

The superheated water is released as a dense cloud of steam that's centered on your space, heavily obscuring the area in a 45-foot sphere that spreads around corners. The cloud does not move with you and lasts for 1 minute or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.",

				"This magical quiver is made from the shell of an enormous oyster. Arrows you pull from it are considered magical and are coated with a pearlescent, hydrophobic coating. Ranged weapon attacks made with these arrows ignore the normal penalties of underwater fighting. These arrows become nonmagical once they hit a target or are held by a creature other than you. In addition, you can speak the quiver's command word to cause it to create a magical pearl. You can hold onto this pearl or give it to another creature. When a creature with the pearl makes a Wisdom ability check or saving throw, that creature can choose to make the roll with advantage. When it does, the pearl turns to dust. The pearl is visibly magical and disintegrates on its own after 24 hours if left unused. Once the quiver produces a pearl in this way, it can't produce another one until the following dawn."

The pig can eat up to 1000 coins of any denomination every hour it spends eating them. It will eat electrum pieces with less enthusiasm. It remains the same size regardless of how many coins are inside of it. The piglet is exceptionally loyal and will listen to commands given by its owner and other allied creatures of the owner's choosing.

The figurine returns to its inanimate form when there are no more coins inside of it.",

If you are dead for longer than 1 minute or are on a different plane of existence than the seed for more than 1 day while it grows, the tree dies and the seed is destroyed.",

At the base of this magic tree is a door large enough for Medium creatures to enter. The door is guarded by a {@creature dryad} who is loyal to you and any creature you choose. The dryad accepts the seed's stem as proof of ownership and uses it as a key to open the door. Once opened, your attunement to the seed ends, the tree belongs to you, and both you and other allies you designate to the dryad can enter and leave the tree at will. Your attunement to the seed does not end if you are more than 100 feet away from it, and can only be ended early by a {@spell wish} spell. If it does, the key disintegrates and the door cannot be opened.",

Each floor has 10 small windows that can't be seen from outside the tree. In addition, the interior of the tree can't be the target of divination magic or entered by teleportation or by extradimensional or interplanar means.",

The tree regains {@dice 1d6} lost hit points every day after taking damage. If a part of the tree, such as the door, is destroyed, a new one regrows after 7 days.",

Once a treant is created in this way, a new one can't be created until the next dawn. A treant disappears after 24 hours, and there can only be one summoned treant at a time. Neither the treant nor the dryad can move farther than 1 mile from the tree. If the dryad is slain, it reappears the following dawn at the base of the tree. If you kill the dryad, the tree becomes a nonmagical tree that is still hollow inside with the floors you'd chosen, but its windows are lost.",
