When you take a {@action Magic|XPHB} action to cast a spell using a spell slot that targets one or more creatures, you can force one target of the original spell to make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, roll on the Eldritch Effects table, and the target creature suffers that effect for 1 minute. At the end of each of its turns, the target repeats the save, ending the effect on itself on a success. This effect ends early if you use this feature again.",
