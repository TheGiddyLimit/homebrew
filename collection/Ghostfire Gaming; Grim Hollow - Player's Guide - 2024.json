It was in this same period human missionaries began teaching their own religions to the dragonborn that remained\u2014of the Aetheric War and the Divine Seraphs. The dragonborn came to believe that their gods had not abandoned them but had been destroyed by the Aether Kindred. With a new faith to fill the void of their lost beliefs, the dragonborn of Castinella became among the most zealous adherents of the Eternal Dogma.",

Those who were scattered across the continent began to undertake pilgrimages to the city, where they were encouraged to embrace worship of the Divine Seraphs. With their ancient prayers seemingly answered at last, many dragonborn were drawn to become clerics, missionaries, and inquisitors, spreading their new beliefs with burning passion\u2014and more often than not with burning fire."

As talented and diligent crafters, the dwarves forged their kingdoms in the valleys and foothills of the two oldest mountains on the continent: the Rock-Teeth and the Grey Spine. Beneath these vast ranges ran rich veins of mithral and gold. The dwarves who mined and crafted these metals quickly became famous across Etharis.",
                            "During the wars of the Era of Expansion, the dwarves barricaded themselves within their greatest capitals: the tiered city of Stehlenwald and the mountain stronghold of Grabenstein. Both fortress cities were once thought impregnable. The dwarves of Grabenstein fought valiantly for their homelands, withstanding multiple sieges until eventually their walls were ruined, their thanedoms uprooted, and their rich mines claimed by human warlords. These conquerors' descendants would later lay the groundwork for the Bürach Empire.",

There, miners laid eyes upon a new metal, impenetrable to the weapons of their enemies: adamantine. With armor and weapons crafted from adamantine, dwarf battalions managed to push the invaders back to their homelands, but at a great cost. The population of Stehlenwald was decimated by war and famine. Isolation within the mountains was the only option for survival for those who remained.",
                            "By the time of the rise of human kingdoms, the proud dwarves of Stehlenwald had recovered from war. They emerged from the mountains at last to discover the political landscape had dramatically changed, leaving them surrounded and vastly outnumbered by the armies of the Bürach Empire. Realizing there was only one way for his people to survive and prosper, the dwarf king struck a deal with the Bürach Empire. The dwarves would surrender their lands and become members of the empire, as long as they could govern themselves independently.",

It's a common phrase in Etharis that it's easier to move a mountain than a dwarf. But though deep wounds still exist in the Bürach Empire, dwarves have become among the most prosperous and accepted peoples in all nations of Etharis."

However, their unchallenged dominion over the forests combined with their long lives made the elves arrogant, setting themselves above and away from other folk—especially humans, who they considered primitive and barbaric.

They instead retreated deep into their forests on the outskirts of human civilization, where they believed the Spirits of Nature would still protect them. When the elves eventually reemerged, they formed a pact with humankind that birthed the Charneault Kingdom.",

They have crafted heartbreaking songs of a lost past that echo among the trees in the night. In these ballads they call themselves the ulufey, meaning mortal fey and the descendants of the fey sidhe. The faerie courts who had once guided the elves were not vanquished in the Era of Expansion and many hope such Spirits of Nature will aid in restoring elven lands to their ancient grace."

Beneath the barrage, the human forces were quickly broken. The effects of the never-before-seen explosives struck fear into their minds, as if witnessing a new and terrible sorcery. A first great battle had been won, but the losses for both gnomes and dwarves were great.",

First recorded emerging from temperate forests in the lands that are now the Bürach Empire, humans were not considered a threat by the dominant folk of the continent.

They cut trees from the Grove Maze to build homes. They journeyed to the reaches of Valika to escape their own kingdoms in the south. When they claimed the lands already populated by other folk, war became inevitable. By the time the great kingdoms of the elves and dwarves recognized the danger of human migration, it was already too late. The bloodshed that followed changed Etharis forever.",

Every human culture has been touched by another heritage in the lands they've come to settle. In the duchies of the Charneault Kingdom, humans pay homage to the Spirits of Nature as taught to them by the elves. The modern fortresses and cities in the Bürach Empire incorporate dwarven stonework and architecture. To this day, humans are considered the dominant folk across all Etharis, controlling most of the land and sea. But their realms are far from homogeneous, each with their own history and mix of folk from other heritages.",

Known as the Era of Descent, the years that followed the Era of Expansion have been witness to the decline of each human domain. While many commoners believe it to be the death of the gods that began this downfall, folk of other heritages whisper that it was human hubris. When there were no more realms to conquer, humanity turned their greed, ambition, and violence upon themselves."

Long before humans had their Eras of Expansion and Descent, and even before the time of elves and dwarves, another civilization had risen and fallen. Where the dwarves of Stehlenwald live today once stood the seat of a nameless empire thought to have surpassed any to have arisen since. For centuries, it lived only in the mythologies of elves and dwarves. In some stories, the downfall occurred when mortals try to challenge the gods. In other tales, the empire was devoured entirely in the first cataclysm that was the Aetheric War.",

As the humans laid claim to Etharis, the Stehlenwald dwarves were forced to dig deeper into their mountain strongholds to withstand the siege. Deep in the dark, even beneath the adamantine that proved to be their salvation, the dwarves found sealed chambers of mysterious origin. With the seals broken, an ancient spell was lifted, and the inhabitants of the chambers began to stir from their millennia-long slumber.",
                            "In the days before the calamity that wiped out their civilization, a group of mystics known as dreamers foresaw the danger and devised a plan to survive it. Time passes differently in dreams, and those ancients were able to use the magic of oneiromancy to free themselves from the flow of time. Suspended between reality and dreams while sealed deep underground, they could live in a state of perpetual slumber for as long as necessary, outlasting the aftermath of the disaster that would wipe out the rest of their kind.",
                            "The plan worked. But living for so long within the world of dreams had unforeseen consequences. Upon waking, the dreamers found that they could no longer differentiate between dreams and memories, with both fading quickly from their minds. The result was the emergence of a new people with no knowledge of their own history—only half-formed images and dreamlike impressions of a place and time that may or may not have existed.",
                            "Now the dreamers struggle to adapt in a world that was not made for them. Whatever their history, they have proven to be quick-witted and strong, able to easily adapt to a new and unknown world. Their long slumber has seemingly left them energized, and able to work even beyond the legendary endurance of the dwarves. Even so, sleep is where the dreamers still feel most at home, and they have a habit of quickly dozing off whenever no immediate task presents itself."

Grudgels are also talented artisans, wanderers, magic weavers, and star gazers. They alone hold the secrets of forging stryllum, a strange substance that occurs when starlight is solidified into glass. Grudgels are hard-working, peaceable among friends, and have a knack for keeping calm under pressure. But they're more than capable of defending themselves against the threats of the wilderness and folk looking for a fight.",

While a grudgel working as a bodyguard or mercenary can make use of such rumors, the one thing that seemingly connects all grudgels is a shared disinterest in discussing or hearing the ancient legends of the orcs.

Laneshi dwell within a culture that views the world in terms of absolutes and a sense of underlying duality. Day or night. Acceptance or rejection. Friend or foe. Their culture is also entwined along the line between life and death. They commune with spirits for guidance and are unafraid to meet their mortal demise.

Using a powerful necromantic ritual, the second twin is sacrificed, its soul bound within the body of the other. Each member of the mystic caste is therefore possessed of two souls—one living and one dead—which grants them vision into the spirit world and heightens their necromantic abilities. Mystics oversee funeral rites, crafting, construction, recordkeeping, and food preparation. The heavier duties of members from this caste are even performed with the aid of undead labor—a nightmarish vision for surface-dwelling folk.",

But at the same time, the rulers of the Llana'Shi Empire have begun to focus on the surface world for unknown reasons. Perhaps some new and greater threat stirs in the dark depths of the sea, and the laneshi seek aid from their air-breathing cousins. Or perhaps there's truth in the fearful whispers that these aquatic visitors have wrought blasphemous pacts with ancient evils, and the laneshi search for new lands to conquer to appease the hunger of an unnamable master."

Yet even outside the scope of such stories, those who know the ogresh often view them as something of an exotic oddity.",
                            "In truth, the scarcity of the ogresh is a result of their particular biology. Young ogresh mature slowly, and during an extended youth that might last decades, they are driven by a deep-seated sense of wanderlust. This feeling compels them to travel in search of a suitable area to settle—one holding ample natural resources, a local population of sentient creatures, and a lack of other ogresh nearby. Once they decide upon an area, an ogresh enters the second stage of their life, which is marked by a drastically increased appetite and a mostly sedentary lifestyle. More than a single ogresh could easily deplete the surplus of a small village, so the reason for their wanderlust is a simple case of biological necessity.",
                            "Given their reliance on other folk for survival, it comes as no surprise that many ogresh are masters of social interaction. But some folk maintain that the ogresh ability to glean insight from others has an unnatural quality to it, revealing more to the ogresh than most creatures would willingly share."

This heritage is intended to encourage players to decide who their character is with a maximum amount of creativity.

One player might create an accursed character taking the form of a halfling-sized talking raven who hatched from a petrified basilisk egg during a full moon. In all the world, there is no one else quite like them, and the combination of heritage traits chosen by the player of that accursed character reflects as such. Another player might choose the accursed heritage to reflect the form and capabilities of a lizardfolk—a heritage that doesn't canonically exist in Grim Hollow. Whether that accursed character represents a wanderer who set out from a lost lizardfolk enclave deep in the Black Mire, or a character born to elf parents cursed by an evil mage, their selection of heritage traits defines their unique place in the world."

Still others might be the result of a living creature who died or was grievously injured before being “reassembled.” But no matter the process that spawned them, the creation of an arisen is often traumatic, typically held as fractured memories of arcane laboratories and the first flickering of consciousness, or as the vague nightmares that are all that remains of a former life.",

The only thing all dhampir truly share is the legacy of their unnatural creation. True vampires are the embodiment of death, mimicking life by twisting cadavers into undead or spreading their curse to spawn more of their own kind. But vampires cannot naturally reproduce or create anything truly living. Dhampir are thus most often the result of some form of necromantic accident—a dying child revived by fell magic, an apothecary mixing herbs with vampire blood, or a failed attempt to find a cure for vampirism.",

Commoners who fear dhampir view them as blood-hungry monsters, despite the fact that most sustain their life with normal food and drink. At the same time, vampires revile them as thin-blooded weaklings. A dhampir's life is thus usually spent searching for somewhere to belong, whether fitting into mortal society or trying to appease their blood-drinking forebears.",

Dhampir are made to feel like monsters by those who are superstitious of them. Yet commoners who care for a dhampir as family can never truly understand their struggle against the monster within.",

Despite lacking conventional parentage, a dhampir may form a familial bond with the vampire they regard as their sire. Vampires who exploit this relationship can gain a valuable ward who is able to walk in sunlight and blend more easily with mortal society. A dhampir in this position may become a spy, steward, or herald of their master. But they understand that they will never achieve positions of actual power in vampire society."

The Great College dedicated to magical study in the city quickly became a sanctum for mages of all disciplines from across Etharis, creating a golden age of magic within its walls.",

Instead, their magic tore a gaping rift in the fabric of reality, and in an instant the entire city was tipped into the void between worlds. Ulmyr's Gate and all its citizens were presumed destroyed. The incident triggered another inquisition against hubristic arcanists who tampered in things mortals were not meant to know. Then, life in the empire went on.",

Though they resemble the people they once were, they are both more and less—creatures of two realms, often haunted by memories of the city's destruction, of which they rarely if ever speak."

They are as calm and personable as any folk, suffering no loss of control or mindless bloodlust under the full moon. However, the feral nature of the beast they carry within them drives most wulven to lives of solitude and the quiet of the wilderness.",
                            "Wulven embody the mysticism of the primal world, rather than its savagery. Where they wander through forest and scrubland, their wild look and solitary nature sees them often mistaken for fey spirits, druids, or actual lycanthropes. Many make lives for themselves as members of druidic enclaves or as protectors of small, isolated communities. Some become emissaries or champions of the fey courts, though the touch of cursed magic in the wulven makes some fey distrust them. But in the end, most wulven live as outlanders, cautious around folk they don't know for fear of their solitary nature and subtly bestial features being misunderstood."
