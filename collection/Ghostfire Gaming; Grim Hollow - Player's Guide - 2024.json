During the Era of Expansion, humanity discovered a kingdom already shattered in Etharis's most southern regions. Not even the dragonborn themselves could recount the history that had led to the destruction of their once-great capital\u2014the granite city of Ember Cairn. When dragonborn prayed, they were met with silence from their gods. They dwelled in the ruins of their own inheritance.",

Disillusion and desperation caused the dragonborn to abandon their ancestral lands and scatter across Etharis, searching for the answers as to why their gods fell silent. It was in this same period human missionaries began teaching their own religions to the dragonborn that remained\u2014of the Aetheric War and the Divine Seraphs. The dragonborn came to believe that their gods had not abandoned them but had been destroyed by the Aether Kindred. With a new faith to fill the void of their lost beliefs, the dragonborn of Castinella became among the most zealous adherents of the Eternal Dogma.",
                            "Castinella awarded the dragonborn a small region of their ancestral land to call their own. From this humble start, they rebuilt the ancient city of Ember Cairn. Those who were scattered across the continent began to undertake pilgrimages to the city, where they were encouraged to embrace worship of the Divine Seraphs. With their ancient prayers seemingly answered at last, many dragonborn were drawn to become clerics, missionaries, and inquisitors, spreading their new beliefs with burning passion\u2014and more often than not with burning fire."

As talented and diligent crafters, the dwarves forged their kingdoms in the valleys and foothills of the two oldest mountains on the continent: the Rock-Teeth and the Grey Spine. Beneath these vast ranges ran rich veins of mithral and gold. The dwarves who mined and crafted these metals quickly became famous across Etharis.",

Both fortress cities were once thought impregnable. The dwarves of Grabenstein fought valiantly for their homelands, withstanding multiple sieges until eventually their walls were ruined, their thanedoms uprooted, and their rich mines claimed by human warlords. These conquerors' descendants would later lay the groundwork for the Bürach Empire.",

There, miners laid eyes upon a new metal, impenetrable to the weapons of their enemies: adamantine. With armor and weapons crafted from adamantine, dwarf battalions managed to push the invaders back to their homelands, but at a great cost. The population of Stehlenwald was decimated by war and famine. Isolation within the mountains was the only option for survival for those who remained.",
                            "By the time of the rise of human kingdoms, the proud dwarves of Stehlenwald had recovered from war. They emerged from the mountains at last to discover the political landscape had dramatically changed, leaving them surrounded and vastly outnumbered by the armies of the Bürach Empire. Realizing there was only one way for his people to survive and prosper, the dwarf king struck a deal with the Bürach Empire. The dwarves would surrender their lands and become members of the empire, as long as they could govern themselves independently.",
                            "Great numbers of dwarves still cannot forgive the great loss of life and sovereignty their ancestors once endured. It's a common phrase in Etharis that it's easier to move a mountain than a dwarf. But though deep wounds still exist in the Bürach Empire, dwarves have become among the most prosperous and accepted peoples in all nations of Etharis."

Tall, graceful, and extraordinarily beautiful, these ancient folk believe they are descended from the nature spirits who cultivated the mortal realm. The elves claim the forests and river lands of Caer Neiada as their ancestral home, in what is now the Charneault Kingdom. Within those deep woods they created magnificent domains, ever taking guidance and blessing from the ageless spirits of the forest.",

Their deep knowledge of the woodlands and their affinity with the fey enable them to conceal themselves effortlessly within their own domains. Their deadly and nimble armies made them a force to be reckoned with in the early days of Etharis. However, their unchallenged dominion over the forests combined with their long lives made the elves arrogant, setting themselves above and away from other folk—especially humans, who they considered primitive and barbaric. And so the elves failed to recognize the humans as a plausible threat.",
                            "The Era of Expansion cost the elves dearly. Their kingdoms were shattered, with many of their forests reduced to ash and blackened stumps. Though their battle prowess never dimmed, the elves found themselves outnumbered and unable to repel war-hungry armies burning and lumbering their sheltering woodlands. They instead retreated deep into their forests on the outskirts of human civilization, where they believed the Spirits of Nature would still protect them. When the elves eventually reemerged, they formed a pact with humankind that birthed the Charneault Kingdom.",
                            "In the end, the sorrow of the elves for their lost paradise empowered them to recreate that beauty in music and arts. They have crafted heartbreaking songs of a lost past that echo among the trees in the night. In these ballads they call themselves the ulufey, meaning mortal fey and the descendants of the fey sidhe. The faerie courts who had once guided the elves were not vanquished in the Era of Expansion and many hope such Spirits of Nature will aid in restoring elven lands to their ancient grace."

Beneath the barrage, the human forces were quickly broken. The effects of the never-before-seen explosives struck fear into their minds, as if witnessing a new and terrible sorcery. A first great battle had been won, but the losses for both gnomes and dwarves were great.",

Halflings also fit into human culture perfectly by acquiring useful positions such as merchants, advisors, teachers, or scholars.

First recorded emerging from temperate forests in the lands that are now the Bürach Empire, humans were not considered a threat by the dominant folk of the continent.

They cut trees from the Grove Maze to build homes. They journeyed to the reaches of Valika to escape their own kingdoms in the south. When they claimed the lands already populated by other folk, war became inevitable. By the time the great kingdoms of the elves and dwarves recognized the danger of human migration, it was already too late. The bloodshed that followed changed Etharis forever.",

They live shorter lives than many other peoples, causing their cultural customs to fade quicker and preventing them from becoming stifled by their own traditions. Every human culture has been touched by another heritage in the lands they've come to settle. In the duchies of the Charneault Kingdom, humans pay homage to the Spirits of Nature as taught to them by the elves. The modern fortresses and cities in the Bürach Empire incorporate dwarven stonework and architecture. To this day, humans are considered the dominant folk across all Etharis, controlling most of the land and sea. But their realms are far from homogeneous, each with their own history and mix of folk from other heritages.",

Many have asserted their claim to the High Throne of Altenheim, wishing to control the most powerful empire in the world. Known as the Era of Descent, the years that followed the Era of Expansion have been witness to the decline of each human domain. While many commoners believe it to be the death of the gods that began this downfall, folk of other heritages whisper that it was human hubris. When there were no more realms to conquer, humanity turned their greed, ambition, and violence upon themselves."

Long before humans had their Eras of Expansion and Descent, and even before the time of elves and dwarves, another civilization had risen and fallen. Where the dwarves of Stehlenwald live today once stood the seat of a nameless empire thought to have surpassed any to have arisen since. For centuries, it lived only in the mythologies of elves and dwarves. In some stories, the downfall occurred when mortals try to challenge the gods. In other tales, the empire was devoured entirely in the first cataclysm that was the Aetheric War.",

Deep in the dark, even beneath the adamantine that proved to be their salvation, the dwarves found sealed chambers of mysterious origin. With the seals broken, an ancient spell was lifted, and the inhabitants of the chambers began to stir from their millennia-long slumber.",

Time passes differently in dreams, and those ancients were able to use the magic of oneiromancy to free themselves from the flow of time. Suspended between reality and dreams while sealed deep underground, they could live in a state of perpetual slumber for as long as necessary, outlasting the aftermath of the disaster that would wipe out the rest of their kind.",
                            "The plan worked. But living for so long within the world of dreams had unforeseen consequences. Upon waking, the dreamers found that they could no longer differentiate between dreams and memories, with both fading quickly from their minds. The result was the emergence of a new people with no knowledge of their own history—only half-formed images and dreamlike impressions of a place and time that may or may not have existed.",
                            "Now the dreamers struggle to adapt in a world that was not made for them. Whatever their history, they have proven to be quick-witted and strong, able to easily adapt to a new and unknown world. Their long slumber has seemingly left them energized, and able to work even beyond the legendary endurance of the dwarves. Even so, sleep is where the dreamers still feel most at home, and they have a habit of quickly dozing off whenever no immediate task presents itself."

Grudgels are also talented artisans, wanderers, magic weavers, and star gazers. They alone hold the secrets of forging stryllum, a strange substance that occurs when starlight is solidified into glass. Grudgels are hard-working, peaceable among friends, and have a knack for keeping calm under pressure. But they're more than capable of defending themselves against the threats of the wilderness and folk looking for a fight.",
                            "Outside of the North, grudgels remain rare enough in Etharis that folk are less likely to meet one than hear fearful rumors regarding their kind. While a grudgel working as a bodyguard or mercenary can make use of such rumors, the one thing that seemingly connects all grudgels is a shared disinterest in discussing or hearing the ancient legends of the orcs.

                            "Deep beneath the waves off the eastern shores of Etharis lies the Llana'Shi Empire, home to the mysterious people called the laneshi by surface dwellers. Appearing incredibly alien to other common folk, these pale humanoids with manes of kelp-like hair are creatures of the sea, able to converse with the flora and fauna of the depths. Laneshi dwell within a culture that views the world in terms of absolutes and a sense of underlying duality. Day or night. Acceptance or rejection. Friend or foe. Their culture is also entwined along the line between life and death. They commune with spirits for guidance and are unafraid to meet their mortal demise. All things must have their place in laneshi society, which is built on a rigid caste system reflecting this view.",
                            "The mystic caste comprises all laneshi born as twins, a common occurrence among their people. The first-born twin is always inducted into the mystic caste, while the other is consecrated as their sibling's spirit guide. Using a powerful necromantic ritual, the second twin is sacrificed, its soul bound within the body of the other. Each member of the mystic caste is therefore possessed of two souls—one living and one dead—which grants them vision into the spirit world and heightens their necromantic abilities. Mystics oversee funeral rites, crafting, construction, recordkeeping, and food preparation. The heavier duties of members from this caste are even performed with the aid of undead labor—a nightmarish vision for surface-dwelling folk.",
                            "The warrior caste of the laneshi oversee not just warfare but diplomacy, farming, and the raising and educating of children. The warrior caste is roughly double the size of the mystic caste, structured as a meritocracy, with great deeds leading to greater status.",
                            "Laneshi warriors skirmish constantly with their deep-dwelling neighbors. But at the same time, the rulers of the Llana'Shi Empire have begun to focus on the surface world for unknown reasons. Perhaps some new and greater threat stirs in the dark depths of the sea, and the laneshi seek aid from their air-breathing cousins. Or perhaps there's truth in the fearful whispers that these aquatic visitors have wrought blasphemous pacts with ancient evils, and the laneshi search for new lands to conquer to appease the hunger of an unnamable master."

Tales describe them as solitary, wise figures who often serve as founts of information and advice for nearby communities. Adventure tales abound in which a protagonist receives counsel from an ogresh before setting off on their quest, even as others describe royal advisors with a distinctive set of broad features. These tales are not without merit, as ogresh can be worldly from their travels in their younger years. Yet even outside the scope of such stories, those who know the ogresh often view them as something of an exotic oddity.",
                            "In truth, the scarcity of the ogresh is a result of their particular biology. Young ogresh mature slowly, and during an extended youth that might last decades, they are driven by a deep-seated sense of wanderlust. This feeling compels them to travel in search of a suitable area to settle—one holding ample natural resources, a local population of sentient creatures, and a lack of other ogresh nearby. Once they decide upon an area, an ogresh enters the second stage of their life, which is marked by a drastically increased appetite and a mostly sedentary lifestyle. More than a single ogresh could easily deplete the surplus of a small village, so the reason for their wanderlust is a simple case of biological necessity.",
                            "Given their reliance on other folk for survival, it comes as no surprise that many ogresh are masters of social interaction. But some folk maintain that the ogresh ability to glean insight from others has an unnatural quality to it, revealing more to the ogresh than most creatures would willingly share."

One player might create an accursed character taking the form of a halfling-sized talking raven who hatched from a petrified basilisk egg during a full moon. In all the world, there is no one else quite like them, and the combination of heritage traits chosen by the player of that accursed character reflects as such. Another player might choose the accursed heritage to reflect the form and capabilities of a lizardfolk—a heritage that doesn't canonically exist in Grim Hollow. Whether that accursed character represents a wanderer who set out from a lost lizardfolk enclave deep in the Black Mire, or a character born to elf parents cursed by an evil mage, their selection of heritage traits defines their unique place in the world."

Still others might be the result of a living creature who died or was grievously injured before being “reassembled.” But no matter the process that spawned them, the creation of an arisen is often traumatic, typically held as fractured memories of arcane laboratories and the first flickering of consciousness, or as the vague nightmares that are all that remains of a former life.",

True vampires are the embodiment of death, mimicking life by twisting cadavers into undead or spreading their curse to spawn more of their own kind.

Commoners who fear dhampir view them as blood-hungry monsters, despite the fact that most sustain their life with normal food and drink. At the same time, vampires revile them as thin-blooded weaklings. A dhampir's life is thus usually spent searching for somewhere to belong, whether fitting into mortal society or trying to appease their blood-drinking forebears.",

Dhampir are made to feel like monsters by those who are superstitious of them. Yet commoners who care for a dhampir as family can never truly understand their struggle against the monster within.",

Vampires who exploit this relationship can gain a valuable ward who is able to walk in sunlight and blend more easily with mortal society.

For the faerie are callous and unchanging beings, and nothing inspires their fascination—and their envy—more than the malleable, bright spark of a young humanoid child.",
                            "A wechselkind is a construct crafted of wood, clay, and ceramic in the form of a small child, animated by faerie magic and concealed in illusion that makes them appear identical to a stolen mortal babe. Once that glamour fades and the lie is revealed, a wechselkind is most often cast out by the stolen child's family, if not destroyed. Occasionally, though, a family takes pity on the poor creature and attempts to raise them, only to find that while their mind develops normally, a wechselkind is forever bound in the unchanging form of a childlike doll.",
                            "Whether nurtured or shunned, most wechselkind eventually find themselves living as outcasts, and learning to fend for themselves as best they can. The residual magic of their faerie glamour allows a wechselkind to conceal themself for short periods, whether in the guise of the child they replaced or an adult halfling, gnome, or other person of similar stature. With few physical needs, a wechselkind can easily wander from settlement to settlement, watching the people they encounter with envious eyes, and hoping for a place to finally fit in.",
                            "With the spread of the Weeping Pox, many wechselkind have emerged from hiding. With their immunity to disease, they're able to aid healers in plague-stricken regions, gaining a measure of respect—or even admiration—from those able to see beyond their tragic origins. However, even wechselkind who are accepted among other folk often remain wary, fearing that once their usefulness is at an end, they might be cast out once more."

But few folk ever come to realize that the hulking stranger they passed on the trade road at dusk, the forest hermit who appeared from nowhere to warn of unseen danger ahead, or the druidic acolyte protecting a sacred spring do not share their fears. For these folk have already been touched by the lycanthropic curse, and have accepted the bestial gifts it bestows.",
                            "Wulven are the natural-born children or descendants of an individual cursed with lycanthropy, not inheriting the curse in full but touched by its feral nature. Those afflicted in this way are commonly associated with werewolves in the minds of commoners, inspiring the name given to them. But wulven are equally likely to be descended from werebears, wererats, wereravens, or even rarer lycanthropes.",
                            "The weaker trace of lycanthropy handed down to a wulven means they do not take animal or hybrid form. They are as calm and personable as any folk, suffering no loss of control or mindless bloodlust under the full moon. However, the feral nature of the beast they carry within them drives most wulven to lives of solitude and the quiet of the wilderness.",
                            "Wulven embody the mysticism of the primal world, rather than its savagery. Where they wander through forest and scrubland, their wild look and solitary nature sees them often mistaken for fey spirits, druids, or actual lycanthropes. Many make lives for themselves as members of druidic enclaves or as protectors of small, isolated communities. Some become emissaries or champions of the fey courts, though the touch of cursed magic in the wulven makes some fey distrust them. But in the end, most wulven live as outlanders, cautious around folk they don't know for fear of their solitary nature and subtly bestial features being misunderstood."

Becoming a Lich takes years of research, countless sacrifices for yourself and others, and the incredibly low moral and ethical standards necessary to follow through.

They might be tricked or forced to undergo a transition to lichdom. They may even think they are free agents, but the forces that turn them into Liches are using them for other purposes."

Each time a caster uses a Shadowsteel Focus to cast a spell, or a warrior wields a Shadowsteel weapon, they risk losing a bit of their soul to gain a bit of power. Players should know what is happening to their characters when they wield Shadowsteel's power. It's a boost to the power of a character, and the risk should be offsetting that power. The toll it takes on the character should be explained by the GM, and hopefully the player—in the spirit of a dark fantasy campaign—should be able to express and illustrate that toll through roleplaying."
