They do not possess the legendary size or impressive wings of their presumed ancestors, but to be dragonborn is to be blessed with the breath and beauty of a dragon.",
							"Some claim that the dragonborn must be the most ancient among all heritages. During the Era of Expansion, humanity discovered a kingdom already shattered in Etharis's most southern regions. Not even the dragonborn themselves could recount the history that had led to the destruction of their once-great capital\u2014the granite city of Ember Cairn. When dragonborn prayed, they were met with silence from their gods. They dwelled in the ruins of their own inheritance.",
							"It was not difficult for humans to settle the southern lands that would become Castinella. Disillusion and desperation caused the dragonborn to abandon their ancestral lands and scatter across Etharis, searching for the answers as to why their gods fell silent. It was in this same period human missionaries began teaching their own religions to the dragonborn that remained\u2014of the Aetheric War and the Divine Seraphs. The dragonborn came to believe that their gods had not abandoned them but had been destroyed by the Aether Kindred. With a new faith to fill the void of their lost beliefs, the dragonborn of Castinella became among the most zealous adherents of the Eternal Dogma.",
							"Castinella awarded the dragonborn a small region of their ancestral land to call their own. From this humble start, they rebuilt the ancient city of Ember Cairn. Those who were scattered across the continent began to undertake pilgrimages to the city, where they were encouraged to embrace worship of the Divine Seraphs. With their ancient prayers seemingly answered at last, many dragonborn were drawn to become clerics, missionaries, and inquisitors, spreading their new beliefs with burning passion\u2014and more often than not with burning fire."

							"Ancient and dauntless as the mountains they call home, the dwarves first appeared in Etharis long before recorded history. As talented and diligent crafters, the dwarves forged their kingdoms in the valleys and foothills of the two oldest mountains on the continent: the Rock-Teeth and the Grey Spine. Beneath these vast ranges ran rich veins of mithral and gold. The dwarves who mined and crafted these metals quickly became famous across Etharis.",
							"During the wars of the Era of Expansion, the dwarves barricaded themselves within their greatest capitals: the tiered city of Stehlenwald and the mountain stronghold of Grabenstein. Both fortress cities were once thought impregnable. The dwarves of Grabenstein fought valiantly for their homelands, withstanding multiple sieges until eventually their walls were ruined, their thanedoms uprooted, and their rich mines claimed by human warlords. These conquerors' descendants would later lay the groundwork for the Bürach Empire.",
							"The dwarven kingdom of Stehlenwald endured. Rather than share the fate of their northern cousins, the Stehlenwald dwarves dug deeper into the heart of the mountain. There, miners laid eyes upon a new metal, impenetrable to the weapons of their enemies: adamantine. With armor and weapons crafted from adamantine, dwarf battalions managed to push the invaders back to their homelands, but at a great cost. The population of Stehlenwald was decimated by war and famine. Isolation within the mountains was the only option for survival for those who remained.",
							"By the time of the rise of human kingdoms, the proud dwarves of Stehlenwald had recovered from war. They emerged from the mountains at last to discover the political landscape had dramatically changed, leaving them surrounded and vastly outnumbered by the armies of the Bürach Empire. Realizing there was only one way for his people to survive and prosper, the dwarf king struck a deal with the Bürach Empire. The dwarves would surrender their lands and become members of the empire, as long as they could govern themselves independently.",
							"Great numbers of dwarves still cannot forgive the great loss of life and sovereignty their ancestors once endured. It's a common phrase in Etharis that it's easier to move a mountain than a dwarf. But though deep wounds still exist in the Bürach Empire, dwarves have become among the most prosperous and accepted peoples in all nations of Etharis."

Tall, graceful, and extraordinarily beautiful, these ancient folk believe they are descended from the nature spirits who cultivated the mortal realm. The elves claim the forests and river lands of Caer Neiada as their ancestral home, in what is now the Charneault Kingdom. Within those deep woods they created magnificent domains, ever taking guidance and blessing from the ageless spirits of the forest.",
							"Many elves are blessed with keen eyesight and a talent for archery. Their deep knowledge of the woodlands and their affinity with the fey enable them to conceal themselves effortlessly within their own domains. Their deadly and nimble armies made them a force to be reckoned with in the early days of Etharis. However, their unchallenged dominion over the forests combined with their long lives made the elves arrogant, setting themselves above and away from other folk\u2014especially humans, who they considered primitive and barbaric. And so the elves failed to recognize the humans as a plausible threat.",
							"The Era of Expansion cost the elves dearly. Their kingdoms were shattered, with many of their forests reduced to ash and blackened stumps. Though their battle prowess never dimmed, the elves found themselves outnumbered and unable to repel war-hungry armies burning and lumbering their sheltering woodlands. They instead retreated deep into their forests on the outskirts of human civilization, where they believed the Spirits of Nature would still protect them. When the elves eventually reemerged, they formed a pact with humankind that birthed the Charneault Kingdom.",
							"In the end, the sorrow of the elves for their lost paradise empowered them to recreate that beauty in music and arts. They have crafted heartbreaking songs of a lost past that echo among the trees in the night. In these ballads they call themselves the ulufey, meaning mortal fey and the descendants of the fey sidhe. The faerie courts who had once guided the elves were not vanquished in the Era of Expansion and many hope such Spirits of Nature will aid in restoring elven lands to their ancient grace."

							"Gnomes have created some of the most impressive mechanical wonders of Etharis. Cannons, automatons, flintlocks, and explosives are all reputed to be results of gnomish crafting. The process of tinkering is as important as the result. Gnomes create new inventions simply to prove it can be done. It's said among other folk that if you're looking for a gnome in a populated city, you need only wait for the explosion to guide your steps.",
							"During the Era of Expansion, gnomes fled their settlements outside the sheltering mountains to seek the protection of dwarf cities such as Stehlenwald. There, they shared the fate of their dwarf cousins as human armies besieged the soaring stone walls of the city. While the dwarves eventually gazed upon adamantine, the ingenious minds of the gnomes hatched other plans with the gifts from the mountains.",

As the adamantine-clad dwarves charged the besieging human armies, they were supported by the sound of explosions as gnome artillery hurled cannonballs and dynamite at the enemy. Beneath the barrage, the human forces were quickly broken. The effects of the never-before-seen explosives struck fear into their minds, as if witnessing a new and terrible sorcery. A first great battle had been won, but the losses for both gnomes and dwarves were great.",
							"So did the gnomes follow the dwarves of Stehlenwald into their centuries-long isolation\u2014and when the dwarf king voluntarily brought his people into the Bürach Empire, the gnomes followed.",
							"Curiously, gnomes have an affinity with the natural world. Those who did not flee for the safety of mountains were called back to their ancestral homes deep in Etharis's forests. Perhaps this suggests a common ancestor with the elves, also."

Halflings hold less value for mundane riches like gold or jewels and were therefore happy paying tithes to stronger and better-armed humans who offered them protection.

Halflings also fit into human culture perfectly by acquiring useful positions such as merchants, advisors, teachers, or scholars.

							"While ancient heritages such as the elves and the dwarves claim to have raised the first kingdoms in Etharis, humans dominate those lands in the current age. Humans can be found everywhere, from the frozen and inhospitable tundra of the North to the scorched plains of the South. First recorded emerging from temperate forests in the lands that are now the Bürach Empire, humans were not considered a threat by the dominant folk of the continent. Left unchecked, their numbers quickly grew. And in the end, the humans' adaptable nature and adventurous mindset led them to expand beyond their homelands.",
							"The period written in history as the Era of Expansion is often portrayed as an endless eruption of violence that lasted centuries as humans spread to every corner of Etharis. Rather, the Era of Expansion describes many separate conflicts that occurred in the wake of human migration. Humans didn't send armies initially, but settlers. They cut trees from the Grove Maze to build homes. They journeyed to the reaches of Valika to escape their own kingdoms in the south. When they claimed the lands already populated by other folk, war became inevitable. By the time the great kingdoms of the elves and dwarves recognized the danger of human migration, it was already too late. The bloodshed that followed changed Etharis forever.",
							"The success of humans is owed to their adaptability. They live shorter lives than many other peoples, causing their cultural customs to fade quicker and preventing them from becoming stifled by their own traditions. Every human culture has been touched by another heritage in the lands they've come to settle. In the duchies of the Charneault Kingdom, humans pay homage to the Spirits of Nature as taught to them by the elves. The modern fortresses and cities in the Bürach Empire incorporate dwarven stonework and architecture. To this day, humans are considered the dominant folk across all Etharis, controlling most of the land and sea. But their realms are far from homogeneous, each with their own history and mix of folk from other heritages.",
							"Of all human vices, ambition is thought to be the most insidious. Humans still dominate positions of power within their societies. Many have asserted their claim to the High Throne of Altenheim, wishing to control the most powerful empire in the world. Known as the Era of Descent, the years that followed the Era of Expansion have been witness to the decline of each human domain. While many commoners believe it to be the death of the gods that began this downfall, folk of other heritages whisper that it was human hubris. When there were no more realms to conquer, humanity turned their greed, ambition, and violence upon themselves."

							"History repeats itself. Long before humans had their Eras of Expansion and Descent, and even before the time of elves and dwarves, another civilization had risen and fallen. Where the dwarves of Stehlenwald live today once stood the seat of a nameless empire thought to have surpassed any to have arisen since. For centuries, it lived only in the mythologies of elves and dwarves. In some stories, the downfall occurred when mortals try to challenge the gods. In other tales, the empire was devoured entirely in the first cataclysm that was the Aetheric War.",
							"Nevertheless, something survived. As the humans laid claim to Etharis, the Stehlenwald dwarves were forced to dig deeper into their mountain strongholds to withstand the siege. Deep in the dark, even beneath the adamantine that proved to be their salvation, the dwarves found sealed chambers of mysterious origin. With the seals broken, an ancient spell was lifted, and the inhabitants of the chambers began to stir from their millennia-long slumber.",
							"In the days before the calamity that wiped out their civilization, a group of mystics known as dreamers foresaw the danger and devised a plan to survive it. Time passes differently in dreams, and those ancients were able to use the magic of oneiromancy to free themselves from the flow of time. Suspended between reality and dreams while sealed deep underground, they could live in a state of perpetual slumber for as long as necessary, outlasting the aftermath of the disaster that would wipe out the rest of their kind.",
							"The plan worked. But living for so long within the world of dreams had unforeseen consequences. Upon waking, the dreamers found that they could no longer differentiate between dreams and memories, with both fading quickly from their minds. The result was the emergence of a new people with no knowledge of their own history\u2014only half-formed images and dreamlike impressions of a place and time that may or may not have existed.",
							"Now the dreamers struggle to adapt in a world that was not made for them. Whatever their history, they have proven to be quick-witted and strong, able to easily adapt to a new and unknown world. Their long slumber has seemingly left them energized, and able to work even beyond the legendary endurance of the dwarves. Even so, sleep is where the dreamers still feel most at home, and they have a habit of quickly dozing off whenever no immediate task presents itself."

							"Legends in Etharis speak of an age of orcs. This ancient heritage has its roots in Etharis' North, from where history claims they spread to terrorize other cultures. Orcs, as the term has become understood, were formidable warriors with endless thirst for battle. Yet tales of their armies nearly conquering all Etharis are almost certainly the propaganda of fearful outside cultures.",

While it's agreed that orcs did flee Etharis in a great fleet, their legacy calling to Thorgard av Holgar a century later, it seems apocryphal that an entire heritage could simply disappear across the sea. Indeed, the truth is more complex than any of those old tales can tell.",

Yet even where they are most populous among the Valikan Clans, grudgels are no more or less predisposed to battle or taking the path of the warrior than any other folk. Grudgels are also talented artisans, wanderers, magic weavers, and star gazers. They alone hold the secrets of forging stryllum, a strange substance that occurs when starlight is solidified into glass. Grudgels are hard-working, peaceable among friends, and have a knack for keeping calm under pressure. But they're more than capable of defending themselves against the threats of the wilderness and folk looking for a fight.",
							"Outside of the North, grudgels remain rare enough in Etharis that folk are less likely to meet one than hear fearful rumors regarding their kind. While a grudgel working as a bodyguard or mercenary can make use of such rumors, the one thing that seemingly connects all grudgels is a shared disinterest in discussing or hearing the ancient legends of the orcs. But whether this extends from wanting to distance themselves from the violent past of their kin, or from some secret knowledge of why the orcs vanished from Etharis, only they know."

							"Deep beneath the waves off the eastern shores of Etharis lies the Llana'Shi Empire, home to the mysterious people called the laneshi by surface dwellers. Appearing incredibly alien to other common folk, these pale humanoids with manes of kelp-like hair are creatures of the sea, able to converse with the flora and fauna of the depths. Laneshi dwell within a culture that views the world in terms of absolutes and a sense of underlying duality. Day or night. Acceptance or rejection. Friend or foe. Their culture is also entwined along the line between life and death. They commune with spirits for guidance and are unafraid to meet their mortal demise.

The first-born twin is always inducted into the mystic caste, while the other is consecrated as their sibling's spirit guide. Using a powerful necromantic ritual, the second twin is sacrificed, its soul bound within the body of the other. Each member of the mystic caste is therefore possessed of two souls\u2014one living and one dead\u2014which grants them vision into the spirit world and heightens their necromantic abilities. Mystics oversee funeral rites, crafting, construction, recordkeeping, and food preparation. The heavier duties of members from this caste are even performed with the aid of undead labor\u2014a nightmarish vision for surface-dwelling folk.",

Perhaps some new and greater threat stirs in the dark depths of the sea, and the laneshi seek aid from their air-breathing cousins. Or perhaps there's truth in the fearful whispers that these aquatic visitors have wrought blasphemous pacts with ancient evils, and the laneshi search for new lands to conquer to appease the hunger of an unnamable master."

							"The more populous cultures of Etharis all have stories about the ogresh, although few have seen these gentle giants in person. Tales describe them as solitary, wise figures who often serve as founts of information and advice for nearby communities. Adventure tales abound in which a protagonist receives counsel from an ogresh before setting off on their quest, even as others describe royal advisors with a distinctive set of broad features. These tales are not without merit, as ogresh can be worldly from their travels in their younger years. Yet even outside the scope of such stories, those who know the ogresh often view them as something of an exotic oddity.",
							"In truth, the scarcity of the ogresh is a result of their particular biology. Young ogresh mature slowly, and during an extended youth that might last decades, they are driven by a deep-seated sense of wanderlust. This feeling compels them to travel in search of a suitable area to settle\u2014one holding ample natural resources, a local population of sentient creatures, and a lack of other ogresh nearby. Once they decide upon an area, an ogresh enters the second stage of their life, which is marked by a drastically increased appetite and a mostly sedentary lifestyle. More than a single ogresh could easily deplete the surplus of a small village, so the reason for their wanderlust is a simple case of biological necessity.",
							"Given their reliance on other folk for survival, it comes as no surprise that many ogresh are masters of social interaction. But some folk maintain that the ogresh ability to glean insight from others has an unnatural quality to it, revealing more to the ogresh than most creatures would willingly share."

Whether created by unique magic, brought to the world through planar gates or extradimensional portals, or representing one of the last members of a heritage thought to have been lost to history, an accursed is a creature whose traits are all freely chosen with a specific character concept in mind.",
							"Accursed are so named not because their birth or creation was the result of magical malfeasance, a hag's bargain, a corrupted scroll, or any of the other typical senses of \"curse\" in the game. Rather, accursed reflects the grim sense of how most other folk in the campaign will view such a character, especially those who don't take the time to learn more about the character's life and outlook. This heritage is intended to encourage players to decide who their character is with a maximum amount of creativity. It's a sort of \"catch-all\" for unique characters who don't fit into another heritage, but can still fit into Grim Hollow.",
							"Accursed typically don't represent a people or a culture and are often entirely unique unto themselves. One player might create an accursed character taking the form of a halfling-sized talking raven who hatched from a petrified basilisk egg during a full moon. In all the world, there is no one else quite like them, and the combination of heritage traits chosen by the player of that accursed character reflects as such. Another player might choose the accursed heritage to reflect the form and capabilities of a lizardfolk\u2014a heritage that doesn't canonically exist in Grim Hollow. Whether that accursed character represents a wanderer who set out from a lost lizardfolk enclave deep in the Black Mire, or a character born to elf parents cursed by an evil mage, their selection of heritage traits defines their unique place in the world."

Rather, each arisen is constructed and given the gift of life, usually by a creator. Arisen are people, to be sure. They have unique personalities, intellects, and experiences, as all humanoids. But do they possess souls? That is an existential question that all arisen must grapple with.",
							"Arisen are made from mostly organic matter. They are not machines, though many possess mechanical parts in small or large measures. One arisen may have a single mechanized limb, while another's organs are held in a cluster of jars. An arisen may have wires protruding from their body that connect to an arcane power supply grafted into their back, while another appears entirely mundane save for some scars and the arcane gems held within their eye sockets.",
							"Some arisen are entirely constructed, built according to some specification or plan. Others start out innocuously through experimentation to replace living limbs or organs, with repeated experiments inexorably pushing a creature to lose all connection to themself. Still others might be the result of a living creature who died or was grievously injured before being \"reassembled.\" But no matter the process that spawned them, the creation of an arisen is often traumatic, typically held as fractured memories of arcane laboratories and the first flickering of consciousness, or as the vague nightmares that are all that remains of a former life.",
							"Their rarity among the peoples of Etharis and the grim rumors that swirl around them most often leave arisen socially isolated. But not all arisen are driven to nihilism by the bleakness of their creation and their lives. For from that trauma, many develop a sense of introspection that drives an intense curiosity and a philosophical viewpoint on matters of life, mortality, and their own place in the world."

A dhampir possesses many of the grim features of their undead sires, but their mortal nature lets them avoid vampiric vulnerabilities. Like their creators, dhampir crave the blood of the living, but are not controlled by such cravings if their will is strong enough to resist it.",
							"Always spawned from creatures of other heritages, dhampir are incredibly rare and vary widely in form and temperament. The only thing all dhampir truly share is the legacy of their unnatural creation. True vampires are the embodiment of death, mimicking life by twisting cadavers into undead or spreading their curse to spawn more of their own kind. But vampires cannot naturally reproduce or create anything truly living. Dhampir are thus most often the result of some form of necromantic accident\u2014a dying child revived by fell magic, an apothecary mixing herbs with vampire blood, or a failed attempt to find a cure for vampirism.",
							"Whatever their origins, most dhampir experience an existence rooted in trauma, and often pervaded by loneliness. Commoners who fear dhampir view them as blood-hungry monsters, despite the fact that most sustain their life with normal food and drink. At the same time, vampires revile them as thin-blooded weaklings. A dhampir's life is thus usually spent searching for somewhere to belong, whether fitting into mortal society or trying to appease their blood-drinking forebears.",
							"A dhampir who chooses life among mortals is often wracked by guilt. Their craving for blood can come to feel all-consuming as they cling to their humanity and empathy. Dhampir are made to feel like monsters by those who are superstitious of them. Yet commoners who care for a dhampir as family can never truly understand their struggle against the monster within.",
							"Other dhampir decide to indulge their bloodlust. They may even vie for position among the nobility of Ostoya. Despite lacking conventional parentage, a dhampir may form a familial bond with the vampire they regard as their sire. Vampires who exploit this relationship can gain a valuable ward who is able to walk in sunlight and blend more easily with mortal society. A dhampir in this position may become a spy, steward, or herald of their master. But they understand that they will never achieve positions of actual power in vampire society."

Founded in the Bürach Empire by a group of ambitious wizards who chafed under the limitations imposed upon them by government bureaucracy, Ulmyr's Gate boasted free study for all mages who sought sanctuary within its walls. The Great College dedicated to magical study in the city quickly became a sanctum for mages of all disciplines from across Etharis, creating a golden age of magic within its walls.",

Instead, their magic tore a gaping rift in the fabric of reality, and in an instant the entire city was tipped into the void between worlds. Ulmyr's Gate and all its citizens were presumed destroyed. The incident triggered another inquisition against hubristic arcanists who tampered in things mortals were not meant to know. Then, life in the empire went on.",
							"Years later, stories began to surface of frightening apparitions sighted in the region where Ulmyr's Gate once stood. These haunting folk seemed oddly blurred or indistinct. Witnesses reporting that they would vanish as suddenly as they appeared. Gradually, it became clear that these poor souls were the survivors of the Ethereal Rift, now trapped between worlds and trying to retain their tenuous grasp on the Material Plane.",

These rare individuals have left or fled their former home, crossing through the Ethereal Rift to roam the mortal world. Though they resemble the people they once were, they are both more and less\u2014creatures of two realms, often haunted by memories of the city's destruction, of which they rarely if ever speak."

And more than a few feel embittered enough by their fall that they have been gleefully accepted by the Arch Daemons as agents to spread fear and destruction in the world.",

Some become emissaries or champions of the fey courts, though the touch of cursed magic in the wulven makes some fey distrust them.

								"This book was born from a desire to tell stories about imperfect heroes fighting terrible monsters\u2014in every guise they take. Monsters have existed in tales since the earliest humans gathered around fires. They're an expression of our greatest fears about the world, used to explain terrifying phenomena from predators to natural disasters to disease. Yet monsters are also a reflection of what we fear most about ourselves.",
								"Unlike many other fantasy settings, Grim Hollow asks you to consider the monster within, as much as those prowling the shadows of Etharis. Your characters may be antiheroes, opportunists, and survivalists, rather than traditional paragons. Within these pages, you will find the means to create characters who are flawed, nuanced, and oftentimes monstrous themselves\u2014figuratively and literally. You will choose traits, skills, magic, and equipment that arm you against the darkness, but by their nature make you an imperfect hero.",
								"You might take on the role of a professional monster slayer, defending those who can't protect themselves; yet your strength is derived from consuming your prey, which mutates your body and makes you feared among common folk. Or your heritage could mark you as unnatural, built from flesh and metal, with only terrifying nightmares remaining of the memories of your previous life.",
								"You must consider your actions carefully. If you choose to fight against injustice, what is the cost of wielding power? If you choose to follow your own ambitions, what havoc are you willing to unleash? Grim Hollow invites you to explore humanity through the medium of roleplaying games and asks, genuinely, \"What is a monster?\"",
								"Grim Hollow offers players a different kind of power fantasy. Etharis is a world where you'll face terrifying dangers and fight desperate battles to achieve the smallest victories. Your strength lies in choosing to fight on nevertheless. You are the glimmer of hope within the impenetrable darkness, and if you so choose, can defeat monsters while battling those within yourself.",
								"It's now time to lock your doors and draw your shutters. Gather 'round the light, but keep your eyes on the shadows. You're entering a world of darkness and horror.",
								"Welcome to Etharis\u2014where adventure is a given, but survival is not."

								"Dark fantasy and horror have long been beloved genres of storytelling. Such narratives invite participants to experience themes and feelings not always associated with the fun of classic fantasy. The tension of dread. The anxiety of paranoia. The drama of despair. Dark fantasy stories are gripping and immersive by their nature. Danger feels more tangible and immediate. Emotional stakes are heightened. There is a thrill in choosing to confront something horrifying.",
								"Classic tabletop roleplaying games often see gallant heroes striding boldly across the countryside to vanquish evil, earning wealth and glory while protecting the world and its people for another day.",
								"Dark fantasy tales are less predictable. Victory is never certain and always costly. The dangers are so great that each battle risks injury or death, making every monster encounter more frightening and thrilling as a result. Your choices are more important because they could destroy as many lives as they save. The question isn't about how you'll save everyone, but rather who is worth saving.",
								"Such impossible circumstances impact your character's journey. Dark fantasy protagonists can be selfish, embittered, vengeful, zealous, or grief stricken. Players are invited to roleplay stories and emotions that differ from the valorous heroes they might typically play. Such experiences are as cathartic and escapist as any game set in a high fantasy world, and choosing whether your character fights the darkness or is consumed by it is often more personal.",
								"The rules in this book provide players with the means to tell their own dark fantasy stories. The unique subclasses each provide a slate of powerful and sinister new abilities. You might take on a new class with the {@class Monster Hunter|GrimHollowPG24}, using your expert knowledge and martial prowess to combat monsters and superstition. You might choose a {@book species|GrimHollowPG24|2|Grim Hollow Heritages} unique to Grim Hollow, burdened by the weight of your tragic heritage. You're also able to build a completely unique character by utilizing the {@book Heritage System|GrimHollowPG24|2|Heritage Traits}, which provides the means to tailor your character to the exact story or play style you envision.",
								"Your characters face many terrible fates, and this book includes one of the worst. You can experience the existential terror of becoming a monster by taking on a {@book Transformation|GrimHollowPG24|8}. Trade pieces of your mind, body, or soul to wield the powers of evil in your fight against that same evil. Embrace the darkness, but be wary not to lose yourself to it.",

								"Etharis is a world on the brink of total destruction. The gods are dead, fear and superstition are rife, and every realm is beset by cataclysms threatening to collapse civilization entirely.",
								"The bleak realities of Etharis make the realm incredibly dangerous. The common folk cower in their fragile bastions of civilization while monsters stalk freely across the land. Travel between towns and cities always carries risk. Even within the walls of relative safety, greed and desperation foster a different kind of evil that preys upon the kind and unwary.",
								"In such a world, how can heroes exist? Etharis is defined by horrible events, and it stands to reason that the characters within it follow suit. When tackling character creation, you must consider how being surrounded by persistent danger has led to a life as an adventurer, braving dangers that most flee in terror. Is your character bitter and cynical, only looking out for their own interests? Does the world's cruelty inspire you to push back against despair, resolving to fight for the last glimmers of hope that remain? What is your character fighting for?",
								"Whatever your motivations, the overwhelming dangers of Etharis seek incessantly to destroy you. The wilderness is perilous, and night is especially so, where light serves as a beacon to those creatures lurking in the inky darkness. Travel is not for the faint of heart. It's important to carefully pick your battles\u2014not every fight or encounter is worth risking injury or trauma, even if it means leaving others to their doom."

Within Etharis you are not simply one among a clergy of divine spellcasters, but a unique prophet of the Arch Seraphs. That's not to say commoners follow you without question. No, suspicion and fear lead folk to doubt the divine miracles you perform, and corrupt religious orders seek to discredit or destroy you if your divine blessings threaten their own authority.",

Other folk turn to darker powers for strength and protection, worshipping daemons and other powerful monsters in place of deities. Such idols exact horrific sacrifices.",

Players must be aware that healing and curative magic is not readily available at shrines or temples. Similarly, resurrection is a near impossibility. Instead, those who can afford it rely on the medical sciences of apothecaries and surgeons for healing."

Such individuals often hold positions of power obtained at others' expense, their privilege sustained by societal structures such as religion or birthright. Dealing with non-player characters (NPCs) is a cornerstone of roleplaying, but the aforementioned conditions in Etharis require negotiation tactics considered beneath many gallant heroes. Help is not something given freely by strangers, whether they have little or much to lose.

At other times, you want your heritage traits to reinforce your chosen character concept, as with building a Ranger who focuses on Exploration traits.

								"Magic manifests itself most visibly in two areas in the world of Grim Hollow: {@book Transformations|GrimHollowPG24|8} and {@book spells|GrimHollowPG24|9}. Each of these magical elements is a manifestation of the temptation that leads people to seek to change themselves and the world around them through a dangerous and unpredictable force.",
								"Spells are the more manageable\u2014and typically less powerful\u2014manifestations of the magic of Etharis. The force, when tamed into the form of a spell, allows for effects that are limited in scope. Curses are less predictable and more gruesome spells that, when they reach their full effects, are likely to destroy their targets. They may also take a toll on their casters.",

Transformations originate when a curse inherent in a creature passes on to another creature, or when a person opens themselves up to a more volatile form of magic that changes them at their very core.",

Tales of innocent victims turning into the same monsters that attack them in the dark forest are as old as time itself. Magic wielders dabbling in forbidden arcana, paying with their very souls for the hubris, permeate most cultures.",
								"Making character Transformations\u2014whether forced onto a creature or self-inflicted\u2014viable within an RPG is a challenge. Sometimes the tropes are worked into a class itself, as we see with the blood-tainted Sorcerer or the pact-making Warlock.",
								"These classes, however, often focus on only the positives. They show what these people have gained from their actions or backgrounds, but rarely do they capture the struggles that come with getting bitten by a lycanthrope, turned into a creature of the night by a vampire, or cursed with ghoul-hood by using the dangerous shadowsteel.",

The power that comes with a Transformation, as well as the drawbacks they represent, can give transformed characters a perceived (or real) advantage over other characters. Likewise, a drawback can be the end of a character, or the entire party, at the most inopportune time.",
										"In addition to the issues of power, the roleplaying and narrative consequences of transformed characters can be far reaching and devastating. A character whose Transformation causes obvious supernaturally infused physical change is unlikely to escape the notice of a villager. Roleplaying those reactions every time can bog down a campaign; to ignore those reactions can make the point of the Transformation moot.",
										"Before using Transformations in your campaign, discuss these issues so they do not harm the enjoyment of all the players and GM.

Perhaps they have succumbed to the lure of power, or they see it as the only way to achieve a greater goal. Regardless, the first step in any Transformation should involve a discussion between the player, the GM, and the rest of the players involved in the campaign. Intentions should be clearly stated, as campaigns with a lighter tone or strict moral boundaries may not suit certain Transformations.",

						"In Etharis, \"magic\" is a catch-all term for a power outside of mortal ability, a means of altering reality altogether. In truth, there are three separate forms of magic, each with their own mystical sources: arcane, divine, and primal.",
						"Magic in the Grim Hollow setting is relatively safe for those who have the proper training and good sense to use it wisely. However, even the most careful practitioner of magic risks falling victim to its corrupting and unpredictable powers. Casting spells, being the target of benevolent magic, or using magic-infused items might be safe for decades, until one small miscalculation or unfortunate coincidence unleashes terrible consequences.",
						"Magical transformations, vile curses, or supernatural attention are within the realm of possible outcomes from prolonged magic use. Then there's the superstitious folks and devoted inquisitors\u2014for whom the very wielding is at best a reason to be wary, and at worst an unforgivable sin.",

								"The archmage pours over a tome in his school. The itinerate wizard travels the world on a quest for ancient knowledge. The resolute sorcerer, haunted with power, turns the fire that burns inside them upon a snarling monster. Each of these rely on a latent force that exists throughout Etharis. Commoners call it magic. Those who can wield it call it the arcane. Despite the innumerable books written on the subject, the source of this power is not well understood.",
								"The greatest authority in Etharis on arcane magic was a man named Raakan el-Adakar. An archmage who lived during the early Age of Expansion, Raakan built an impressive library on the nature and source of magic. Much of the modern literature concerning the arcane is rooted in Raakan's research.",
								"He determined that arcane magic emanates from a dimension parallel to the Material Plane, a place suffused with energy that can alter reality. He named this plane \"Numena\" and the energy itself \"numen.\" Magic, according to Raakan, involves using numen to give physical shape and form to the magician's will.",
								"Commoners with the right gifts or knowledge can touch, or according to Raakan, \"speak to\" the realm Numena to elicit a response. The language used to communicate might require a spoken phrase, a complex gesture, or a particular object. These combinations of verbal, somatic, and material components are called \"spells.\" When mages cast spells, they weaken the border separating Numena from the Material Plane in order to draw and shape numen into a magical effect as woven by the spell.",
								"Wizards learn the language of spells through study and years of careful practice. Learning to speak to the arcane is immensely difficult, so that even the most powerful wizards must utilize a spellcasting focus and a spellbook. Spells more complicated than cantrips require persistent study from the pages of a spellbook to ensure the components of the spell are performed accurately each day.",
								"Those capable of casting spells without study or memorization are called sorcerers. For these casters, touching Numena is like flexing a muscle. For others, called warlocks, it's as if the knowledge or arcane spells is whispered into their minds from an unknown entity beyond the Material Plane.",
								"Several theories have been put forth on what Numena actually is. One states that Numena is a word encompassing any realm other than the Material Plane. This hypothesis attempts to reconcile perceived differences between arcane, divine, and primal magic, arguing the process of casting a spell is the same for each, except for where the numen originates.",
								"Other scholars believe Numena isn't a realm at all. Some suggest it's an invisible force not dissimilar to gravity, but which is imperceptible to all besides mages. Another theory infers that Numena is itself a living entity attempting to shape our dimension to match its own. This premise, though terrifying, explains why spells are so difficult to keep in mind: knowledge of their components slips from the mind like oily aberrations.",

										"Sadly, Raakan el-Adakar did not live to complete his research. His own thesis was that Numena was a traversable realm, and for his final magical experiment he opened a portal to some magical plane. When Raakan returned some years later from whichever realm he'd visited, be it Numena or some other distant reality, he was unintelligible. He spent his final days confined in Cold Iron Keep under the watchful eye of guards, who claimed to suffer bizarre visions and disturbing ailments until the day Raakan perished.",
										"Society has always had a divided and suspicious view of arcane magic. Though its power is unrivalled, its mystery, unpredictability, and undeniable dangers make it feared and hated by those who cannot wield it. To rulers, magic represents a threat to their authority. To commoners, mages are a mutual enemy who can be blamed for all the world's unexplained troubles.",
										"There is certainly merit in fearing the arcane. Raakan el-Adakar's fate is one among countless cautionary tales. Casting spells is fundamentally the practice of trying to speak a language nobody truly understands, and the unintended results of experimentation have been devastating, such as when countless souls were lost in the instant the mages of Ulmyr's Gate upended their city into the Ethereal Plane.",
										"Even among arcane scholars there are fears that magic permanently thins the veil between the Material Plane and Numena. Each spell cast is like picking at the threads of a tapestry until holes begin to form. If true, what horrors could have wriggled through? This anxiety is the basis of a theory that spellcasters are to blame for the advent of the Great Beast. Though entirely unproven, such a rumor has made those who wield magic even further detested by society.",
										"Characters capable of wielding magic should be wary of when and where they choose to demonstrate their talents. Even friendly acquaintances may turn fearful or even hostile when confronted with the arcane. To a mage, the misunderstandings of the uneducated can be as dangerous as any magic.",
										"A mortician willing to help a murder investigation might flee in terror upon witnessing a wizard speak with the dead. A bard's audience could quickly turn into an angry mob if they believe they've been enchanted by a bardic spell.",
										"A wise mage's greatest asset is caution. Rumors of their magic could easily reach the ears of a truly dangerous foe, such as an agent of the {@book Arcanist Inquisition|GrimHollowPG24|10|The Arcanist Inquisition}. However, cultures across Etharis do treat their spellcasters with differing attitudes. In some corners of the continent a mage may yet find sanctuary.",

										"In the {@book Bürach Empire|GrimHollowPG24|8|The Bürach Empire}, magic is considered a means to project power, instill obedience, gather information, and maintain order. For these reasons, magic is highly valued, yet mages themselves are heavily regulated and their freedom restricted.",
										"Those who cannot cast magic fear it. Therefore, strict laws govern the lives of mages across the empire. Licenses are given to mages who graduate their college, which stipulates not only which spells they're permitted to cast but also under what circumstances. Sorcerers and warlocks who operate outside official sanctions are outlaws and may become hunted if they're feared to be dangerous.",
										"With the coming of the Great Beast, magic is now treated with even greater suspicion, as some have come to suspect that the entity was the result of an arcane experiment gone horribly wrong. The Hearthkeepers have not denied this notion, as it deflects their own culpability on the matter.",
										"The {@book Ostoyan|GrimHollowPG24|8|The Ostoyan Empire} view of magic is more varied. In the provinces still under the sway of the {@book Crimson Court|GrimHollowPG24|10|The Crimson Court}, the lower classes, still incapable of understanding the arcane, fear magic. They stay clear of magic and its practitioners to avoid inciting the jealousy and ire of the nobility.",
										"The Crimson Court makes it clear to all its subjects that the use of magic is theirs by right; anyone who uses magic must either become a servant of the Crimson Court or be labeled as a threat and destroyed. Thus, one most often finds Ostoyan mages in the Crimson Court's employ taking part in wars against the rebellious province of Raevo and the Bürach Empire.",
										"In the province of Raevo, magic is by and large an accepted part of daily life. The workshops and markets of Castalore host wizards leading around magical constructs or trading occult objects among themselves. All this is done under the watchful eye of the {@book Ravencourt Sanctuary|GrimHollowPG24|9|Ravencourt Sanctuary}. Magic is valued to maintain sovereignty against the power of the Crimson Court and the forces of the Bürach Empire, as well as to repel raids from the marauding clans of Valika.",
										"In the {@book Charneault Kingdom|GrimHollowPG24|8|The Charneault Kingdom}, the elves treat magic as an integral part of their lives. They hold skilled mages in high esteem, even as they tread cautiously around the cost of seeking greater magical power. While elven magecraft has achieved great magical benefits for its people, the price for missteps is often paid by the entirety of the kingdom, as is the case with the dark mist.",
										"In the human-controlled lands of Charneault, attitudes vary greatly. Mages are treated with respect in more learned circles, but among Knight Chapters they are met with suspicion, and in the case of the Severe Templars, outright hostility. These human-centric forces hold elven magic accountable for the suffering endured by the populace, leading them to forego most arcane abilities in favor of strength in arms and divine fervor.",
										"It's worth noting the {@book Castinellan Provinces'|GrimHollowPG24|8|The Castinellan Provinces} stance toward magic: deplorably, the theocracy is hostile to all forms of arcane or primal magic. It is the will of {@book Empyreus|GrimHollowPG24|9|Empyreus}, they claim, that their people wage a righteous war against all magic users and those who harbor them.",
										"To undertake this task, the {@book Arcanist Inquisition|GrimHollowPG24|10|The Arcanist Inquisition} has assembled a host of knights and common soldiers under the command of clerics and paladins. Backed by the power of belief in the inherent corruptive nature of arcane magic, they call on divine magic to locate mages and neutralize them.",
										"As such, magic-using arcanists must be careful when entering and traveling with the Castinellan Provinces, lest they be arrested, imprisoned, and very likely put to death by the Arcanist Inquisition. Mages cannot expect sympathy from the common folk, as most peasants hold all magic as witchcraft and devilry, the power of demons brought to Etharis.",
										"The Castinellans have yet to move against nations that employ magic, such as the Bürach Empire and the Charneault Kingdom. But should the theocracy grow more powerful, a \"righteous war\" would certainly be in the cards. It would only take one international incident of arcane treachery\u2014real, imagined, or staged\u2014to incite a holy war between Castinella and a neighboring nation."

Apart from that, a mage who successfully graduates from the Sanctuary is free to do what they will and teach whomever they want.",

By watching and listening to the natural world, the elves believe the Spirits of Nature whisper the language of spells to those with the aptitude to listen.

They were an active threat to the gods' power by their mere presence, and the gods feared that one day all they had built would be stripped away. They had to strike now, while they still had the faith of their followers and stood at the height of their power. Thus, the gods banded together as a host and attacked the Kindred. This became known as the Aetheric War.",
												"Scriptures differ on what happened to the gods who participated in the war. Some theologians say it was a slaughter. Others believe the gods were consumed by the eldritch horrors they tried to defeat. Others state that some gods retreated from this plane to someplace the Kindred could not reach them. While nothing is certain about what happened to the gods thereafter, it is clear they were utterly defeated.",

Perhaps out of caution or fear, they held back from joining the other gods in the Aetheric War. Thus, they were the only ones left to pick up the pieces, becoming responsible for the fostering of Etharis' future."

						"Another element that transcends all of the factions discussed here\u2014and so many of the lesser factions in Etharis\u2014is simple to understand: power. Sometimes this power comes from the magical ability of its members. Other times it comes from the knowledge and influence that the group's leaders and members can bring to bear. The power may even come from the fear that the faction inspires in those it controls. Regardless, it's this power that makes Etharis's factions so formidable.",

The characters may have a symbiotic relationship with these factions: the factions can offer the characters a small piece of that power, as well as a sense of direction and goals to achieve.",
						"On the other hand, each of these factions may abuse that power, making them institutions that the characters must oppose. Just as the characters in a Grim Hollow campaign must constantly be on guard against their own corruption as they gain power, these factions have the capability to perform and propagate great evil in the name of doing good.",

This order became known as the Arcanist Inquisition. Thereafter, Montego was referred to with reverence as Sagrado.",
								"Valieda claimed that the Arch Seraph Empyreus spoke to him, declaring that arcane magic was a curse that endangered its wielders and everyone who associated with them. With the Inquisition embracing this warning as a core tenet, efforts began to control and limit the use of magic in Castinella.",

After some time, they began arresting those known to be magically gifted and bringing them to segregated cells, where they would live a life of humble service to the Arch Seraph. The Inquisitors were eager to find these people at the youngest possible age, as they claimed the threat of magic could be more easily contained in the young, whose magical abilities had not fully emerged.",
								"After completing his Seraph-mandated tasks, Sagrado Valieda returned to the land known as the Shattered Peaks to bring his message to the dragonborn. As missionaries of the Arch Seraph Empyreus spread their teachings across Etharis, some dragonborn migrated back to the Castinellan Provinces. Centuries of wandering and resentment at the absence of their ancient gods left the scattered dragonborn people ready for a new cause.",

Valieda announced that all dragonborn were welcome to reconstruct their former city of Ember Cairn, which had fallen eons ago, as long as they were raising it to the glory of Empyreus. As the dragonborn were now the most zealous followers of the Divine Seraph, Valieda made Ember Cairn the headquarters of his newly created Arcanist Inquisition and raised the Cathedral of Embers.",

								"The Arcanist Inquisition Headquarters is a maze through which only well-trained Inquisitors can find their way. According to rumors, the cells have no locks, and the Inquisitors let prisoners loose to determine whether or not they have magical abilities: if they find an exit, they are immediately recaptured and found guilty of magical impurity. Whether true or not, the fact remains that very few people are released from this place. Those who do emerge seldom escape with a healthy body and mind.",

The strict doctrines, moral purity, and unexamined creed of the Inquisition are attractive to those who like their moral compasses unwavering in the face of scrutiny...or truth.",

Some innocent lives are lost when overzealous Inquisitors let their judgment be swayed by ambition, fear, or corruption. Characters working for the Arcanist Inquisition find themselves having to make hard moral choices\u2014any hesitation to enforce the Inquisition's harsh divine laws is often seen as an unforgivable sin."

Such guilds are likely to only take larger contracts that require their combined skills and cover their increased costs. Other guilds are a looser associations of lone wanderers who gather once a year in a dusty guild hall to share news and stories from the road. Hunters in these guilds may choose to travel in pairs: a mentor and apprentice. They protect each other, pass down their teachings, and continue guild traditions.",

Others employ more esoteric methods, such as learning spells or employing sophisticated traps. Then there are the guilds who embrace fully eldritch methods by devouring monster flesh to self-inflict physical mutations, horrifying many other hunters. Public attitudes towards the hunting guilds also vary due to their methods. Some folk value hunters as professionals required to keep civilization safe. Others abhor them as extortionists and freaks, who likely consort with the monsters they claim are their enemies.",
								"Monster hunters are likely to join larger adventuring parties. A guild hunter in a party might continue to receive news, contracts, and even instructions from their guild whilst adventuring. A hunting guild might also hire the expertise of an adventuring party directly, consulting a wizard in matters of the arcane, or asking a ranger to guide them through a dense wilderness.",

While most guild hunters would balk at accepting contracts on people, some who are less scrupulous or more desperate might take payment to cut down anyone who blurs the line between mortal and monster."

								"The Morbus Doctore appeared shortly after the release of the Weeping Pox, although some swear the members of the medical and scientific organization were walking the streets before the first cases of the disease presented themselves. Regardless of when the organization was founded, the members are easy to spot: boots and gloves dried with blood, strange coats and satchels hung with vials, and frightful masks meant to protect them from the disease. They now wander the {@book city of Liesech|GrimHollowPG24|8|The City of Liesech}\u2014as well as other major metropolitan areas of Etharis\u2014looking for newly infected people to treat.",

								"The combined medical and scientific knowledge held by the members of the Morbus Doctore is staggering. While examining, treating, studying, and caring for those afflicted with the Weeping Pox, the physicians have taken advantage of the rare opportunity to examine the living and the dead at such close proximity.",
								"For the poor and infirm, the Morbus Doctore is both a blessing and a curse. A doctor coming into your life likely means you or someone close to you is suffering from a deadly disease. However, with the doctor also comes relief from the pain such diseases bring. And then there's always the rare but rumored possibility of a full recovery.",
								"However, no medical breakthrough is achieved without suffering. Some who've seen the Morbus Doctore at work claim that they revel in the death they see every day. They torture their \"patients.\" They perform cruel and nauseating experiments with no regard for their charges. They graft skin, extract marrow, and inject tinctures. Then they observe with fascination, scribbling notes in the name of science. The most insidious rumor suggests they might even have been responsible for the spread of the Weeping Pox in the first place.",
								"Members of the group share information with each other regularly, ensuring that no valuable data or knowledge is lost or hoarded. They do not share their research outside their cabal, and it isn't clear to which authority Morbus Doctore answers. If there is a leader or leadership hierarchy in the organization, that information is not publicly available.",
								"While most of the Morbus Doctore hide their identities behind their plague masks, the group relies on less mysterious presentations when interacting with the public. Local doctors and nurses are called upon to interact with a skittish public. Maintaining strong relationship between citizens and their local doctors can foster trust with the Morbus Doctore. In return for this service, the local physicians get the benefit of the expertise, knowledge, and cures held by the Morbus Doctore.",
								"Adventurers are another valuable tool for the Morbus Doctore. Whether it's extracting rare components from monsters, acting as security in dangerous situations, or tracking down delirious patients who escaped from quarantine, the physicians rely on experts and mercenaries in areas they don't thrive.",
								"With so much death in the vicinity of the Morbus Doctore, accusations of evildoing are inevitable\u2014and may be well founded. Whether the entire group is corrupt, or individual members tend to overstep their moral and ethical bounds, characters might be called upon to investigate the demise of an otherwise healthy patient. And if there is a larger conspiracy at the heart of the Morbus Doctore, adventurers will be at the center of that investigation."

These dissidents occupied a fort outside of Castalore, where they formed a militia fully committed to the destruction of the undead and the liberation of the rest of Ostoya. Thus the Order of Dawn was born.",
								"From their inauguration into the Order, each member is taught to hate undeath. Every such monster has been studied and dissected, their weaknesses carefully catalogued. While few compared to national armies or other global organizations, each member of the Order is trained and battle-ready. They're prepared to give their lives for their cause, and no vampire can expect mercy from them.",
								"Currently, the Order is led by General Artemios Dulka, an Ostoyan noble who abdicated his title to escape the vampire curse. In retaliation, the vampires massacred his family that remained in Nov Ostoya. A good man at heart, Dulka is driven by hatred of the Crimson Court aristocracy and will stop at nothing to destroy the undead.",
								"While the group maintains strongholds on the fringes of Ostoya and in the rebel province of Raevo, they also operate safe houses and spy networks within the Crimson Court's territory of the Ostoyan provinces. To that end, the Order of Dawn recruits freelance spies and mercenaries from whose ranks they draw new members. The Order is suspicious by nature, especially of shapeshifters and glamoured thralls, and so only characters who prove themselves are permitted to join as full initiates.",
								"The Order of Dawn, however, is rigid in its deeds and principles. They exhume graveyards to burn or desecrate the cadavers, ignoring the mournful wails of the local population. They're intolerant of dhampir, who they do not trust. They prosecute whoever aids the Crimson Court as a collaborator, even if the person in question was given little choice. In these situations, characters may find themselves at odds with the members of the Order of Dawn, especially if they've taken a contract from Ostoyan nobility or cannot abide the Order's strict doctrine.",

								"In the western island of Holgar, in the portion of the lands of {@book Valika|GrimHollowPG24|8|The Valikan Clans} known as Thrull, an order of druids known as the Prismatic Circle arose. Their tenets held that only war and bloodshed could keep the world safe from the reawakening of Gormadraug, the Prismatic Wyrm that birthed the Primordials. Several clans followed their teachings, turning Thrull into an area that made its primary mission, apart from survival, obedience to the Prismatic Circle.",
								"In the east, another province arose in opposition to the Prismatic Circle: Kandar. The three clans that made up Kandar accepted newcomers from other nations and tried to dispel old superstitions about the Great Wyrm. They have advocated for peace and trade instead of the old Valikan ways of war and raiding. The two sides soon came to blows over their beliefs, and thus began the Thrull\u2013Kandar War.",
								"Hjadana, the Grand Druid of the Prismatic Circle, is spiritual leader of the Thrull people, and the true power behind the three clans that form Thrull. Hjadana truly believes that their way of living is saving the world from a great menace and an inevitable apocalyptic event. Thus, she exhorts each chief to continue the war against any who oppose them.",
								"The Grand Druid, along with the other leaders of the Prismatic Circle, dwells within a hollow hill, surrounded by a fortress composed of living oak trees. Within this sacred area, she can command the air and earth itself to aid her in the sacred duties of her druids' circle. It is here where living sacrifices to the sleeping Gormadraug are made on holy days and hung from the oaken boughs.",
								"Those opposing the Prismatic Circle's brutal domination of Thrull risk becoming sacrifices themselves. Hjadana preaches that the Coldfire Crisis plaguing eastern and central Valika is a sign that the Great Wyrm is stirring, and thus she commands all the clans to intensify their raids and sacrifices. Many believe her warnings, and she gains new converts by the day.",
								"Characters are most likely to come into conflict with the Prismatic Circle within Valika, as the clans that support the Circle take and transport people to use as sacrifices. However, the raiders who sail south from Thrull to pillage towns and villages on the coastlines of other nations are a threat that adventurers may be hired to repel.",
								"But what if the prophecy about the Prismatic Wyrm's awakening is true? Gormadraug is a central figure in the tales of all the {@book Valikan clans|GrimHollowPG24|8|The Valikan Clans}, and it is difficult to deny the increasing problems faced in the north. Some who don't accept the Prismatic Circle's violent ways still work with them, trying to understand and prevent the Coldfire Crisis from spreading."

They're responsible for many of the greatest calamities to befall the continent. Some claim they are the true puppeteers behind the Morbus Doctore and that they unleashed the Weeping Pox. Others suggest the Thaumaturge banished Ulmyr's Gate to eliminate their wizardly rivals.",

They're believed to vex the Arcanist Inquisition\u2014a hidden enemy the Inquisition both fears and denies the existence of. In Ostoya, the Lady of Masks is whispered to be a member. Therefore, resistance against the Crimson Court must be stoked by the Thaumaturge.",
								"In the {@book Bürach Empire|GrimHollowPG24|8|The Bürach Empire}, it's believed Martorius, whose magnificent castle spontaneously appeared atop the Rock-Teeth Mountains, is a member of the Thaumaturge. If such a thing could be true, his purpose remains a mystery. Why would he make his presence suddenly known? While it's whispered in taverns that tolerate such talk that Martorius has appeared in time to fight the Great Beast, the Hearthkeepers and nobility remain nervous. No agent sent to his castle without invitation has ever returned.",
								"Fables about the Thaumaturge have spread across Etharis, and powerful mages in every nation are assumed to be connected. Yet the fact remains no evidence of the Thaumaturge's actual existence has ever been produced.",
								"Occasionally, characters may receive a mysterious contract. An unknown benefactor has asked for an artifact to be recovered. A noble must be assassinated. A prisoner is to be freed. Yet there are many organizations in Etharis who prefer keeping their involvement in certain affairs secret. Following such threads has never led back to the Thaumaturge.",
								"In other circumstances, characters may return to a village they swore to protect only to discover it has disappeared as if it never existed. Or perhaps, a military leader contracts a disease, unexpectedly. Within days he's dead, yet nobody else appears ill. Such impossible events are whispered to befall those who displease the Thaumaturge.",

Composed of priests, paladins, chaplains, and other clergy, the Watchers have dedicated themselves to preserving the old faiths in this new form.",

Each elects a High Priest to rule the sect, with the most populous sect having the greatest weight in votes. The current High Priest, Nola Cirdanal, is a follower of Empyreus. Her uncompromising stance has put the Watchers on the path to war against several factions that have fallen afoul of the Eternal Dogma.",
								"The Watchers have urged the Arcanist Inquisition to undertake various holy missions across Etharis in an effort to stamp out all that is, in Cirdanal's words, \"corrupt, heretical, iniquitous, or displeasing to the eyes of Heaven.\" They have pursued the Augustine Trading Company for its efforts at weaponizing monsters, the {@book Ostoyan|GrimHollowPG24|8|The Ostoyan Empire} nobility for falling to vampirism, and the {@book Valikan|GrimHollowPG24|8|The Valikan Clans} tribes for raiding and worshipping the elements.",
