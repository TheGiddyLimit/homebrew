						"A common misconception regarding traps is that their purpose is solely to inflict damage on characters. This is a very limited view. A trap that is blundered into, goes off, injures a few characters, and then is forgotten can be a wasted opportunity. The best traps are the ones that characters find and then spend time and brainpower trying to overcome in interesting ways, asking questions like: Can it be disabled? If not, can it be circumvented? Can its effect be minimized?",
						"One of our primary goals as storytellers is engagement, and traps can be an {@i excellent} tool for this! An adventuring party is made up of players who all have fun in different ways. As diverse as our players can be, so too are their characters, with different skills, proficiencies, and areas of expertise. Traps, when used well, can add to everyone's experience. A trap can allow a player to flex their roleplaying muscles or it can highlight a meticulously optimized character build. This book has hundreds of examples of ways to challenge players. When using them, consider the things your players enjoy, and what their characters can do, and use obstacles that play to these things. Be conscious of where they get invested, when they are having fun, and how they react. Give everyone opportunities to contribute and to overcome the challenges laid before them. This creates a satisfying experience for everyone.",
						"This book is the culmination of thousands of hours of combined game-mastering experience and the wisdom that those contributors have imparted to us. The traps and puzzles found herein are designed to fit many situations, but you will certainly find some you enjoy more than others. Some may be perfect for your campaigns, while some will almost certainly not be. Investigate, delve, and seek out those that are just the right fit for you. It is also our hope that as you read, you will be inspired to create your own. Use this book as a guide and as a companion on the hazard-strewn path that is the craft of trap-and-puzzle-making.",

								"So, we were finally out of that godforsaken jungle and into the somewhat cooler interior of the temple. After cleraing aside some cobwebs and most certainly disturbing more insects than I care to think about, we sallied forth into the bowels of the temple, ready to get our hands on this artifact we've been hearing so much about.",
								"We head along down a corridor and, in retrospect, I feel like I should have known something was up. Long abandoned temple, tripwires-of-barbarian-mudering hidden in the trees, and here we were with a nice, long, open corridor? Not bloody likely...",
								"I looked around and saw dust motes floating in the air, shimmering in the sunlight coming through the temple entry. It was almost kind of pretty. Then I noticed more dust. Falling dust. From the ceiling. As soon as I opened my mouth to say something, we all felt this deep rumbling come from around us. Yes, it was pretty clear that things were about to get bad, and quickly.",
								"The left wall started inching toward us and I could sense tiny (or, in some cases, not-so-tiny) bouts of claustrophobia blossoming in all of us. To make matters worse, foot-long spikes erupted from the mouths of the sculptures on the wall to our right. If we didn't do something fast, we were going to be pulped or skewered; a fate I would perhaps wish on my worst enemies but almost certainly not upon myself or my compansions.",
								"As the walls got close, our barbarian (god bless the brute) stretched out his arms and braced against them. Every vein in his face stood out as he strained, his feet wide, his shoulders and back bunching and flexing as the pressure built. A horrendous grinding sound came from a mechanism within the walls as it fought the big man's incredible strength. He started screaming as his bones began cracking, muscle tearing. Our cleric started healing him, mending his body even as it was breaking...",
								"And then there was a sound, like a clank, a clatter, or something falling apart, and the wall stopped. We were alive for the moment, but something told me this isn't the worst this place can do..."

Thankfully, before he turned me into an idol-less amputee, our wizard (bless her) got in his way.",

								"Venturing on from our previous unsettling situation, we arrived at a locked door in a corridor. Its wallers were covered in graven faces with yawning, hungry mouths. By now, we knew that sticking around any place like this was likely not the best idea, so we did what we could to make haste. Our wizard, sharp as ever, discovered a mechanism nestled in one of the open mouths and determined that this must open the uncooperative exit.",
								"Working with delicate devices is one of my many diverse abilities, so I stepped up to the contraption and set to work. Because nothing in the world can ever go smoothly, or perhaps because I am beset by a curse which has doomed me to wind up in places that want me dead, something started happening; something that was certainly not the door unlocking.",
								"The floor started shaking, and split in two! It began edging ever-wider as the barbarian stood astride the gap (I find this mildly funny, considering his position in the first hallway was almost the exact opposite of this). To make matters worse, the open mouths (except for the one I was working on) started belching down dascading lava-flows.",
								"Our cleric did his best to shield us from a nearby lavafall, as our wizard took to the air, and our ranger clung to the barbarian's back for dear life. And then there was, of course, myself, whose hands were most certainly rock-steady and not shaking at all at the ghouthg of falling into a gaping chasm before being excrutiatingly boiled alive in molten earth.",
								"And then, after an eternity of hand-sweat-producing moments, I felt something and heard every rogue's favourite sound in the world: a satisfying click. The lava-drooling faces ceased their salivation, the floor gap which was threatening to split our barbarian up the middle retracted, and the door to go deeper into the temple was now open.",
								"We went through the door, even if at this point it may well have been against our better judgement..."

								"We arrived in a great chamber, a vaulted ceiling soaring high overhead. Massive statues stood along the walls, hands raised as if saluting our valiant and unflinching resolve to get to this point. Perhaps this temple was built with so many traps as a sort of trial, a test of mettle and fortitude, if you will. This would certainly make sense, for there, unguarded and awaiting us, was the artifact.",
								"As a group we all proceeded forward, intent on experiencing this long-awaited moment together. We stood around the artifact and took it (I won't say who actually took it, that's for me to know). We waited a moment, sure that something terrible was about to happen, but nothing did. We looked at one another, hesitantly smiled, then quickly desolved into laughter, cheers, hugs, and rejoicing in our accomplishment. We walked out of the room, and out of that awful temple for good.",
								"... At least, that's what I'd hoped would happen. Oh, there were cheers and much rejoicing and all that, but as soon as we started to walk away, everything gave way in an almighty lurch. We saw the massive granite statues sway ominously as streams of dust cascaded down from the ceiling high above. Cracks raced along the walls and up into the ceiling itself as the whole place started coming down.",
								"Dazzling beams of sunlight streamed through as huge chunks of the ceiling broke free and slammed down around us. We darted left and right, avoiding them as best we could. There was a low groaning sound from above, which made our wizzard say something I'll not repeat here. One of the towering statues was falling straight toward us. While most of us reflexively screamed and futilely tried to brace for what was coming, our wizard stood tall, stretching out an arm as if mocking the gigantic carving.",
								"As she screamed in defiance, a shimmering orb of force bloomed around us just as the incalculable tons of stone slammed into it. The world was filled with nothing but dust, grit, and the sound of rattling stone. I opened my eyes and saw my companions doing the same. We weren't smears on the ground! We were alive! As the dust settled, we looked around at the wreckage, and those sunbeams sliced through the gloom as a final, divine reward for our work.",

						"Answering questions like these will help to set you on a firm footing and give you a clear vision of what your trap needs to do and how it needs to do it. It will also help you decide on the trap's severity.",

For example, a tropp of goblins in the forest are likely to have many nets, snares, and poison darts set up to capture or kill prey. On the other hand, a group of cultists trying to protect the relics in their deity's temple could have traps designed to blast intruders with elemental magic, fatally wound them with scything blades, or crush them to death with closing walls.",
						"The spcae a trap occupies matters in terms of how things physically fit together. If a dungeon is built into a hill, but the internal ceiling of the dungeon is just below ground level otuside, things that rise up into the ceiling would stick out of the ground above. Creatures walking along would certainly wonder about a large, random-seeming portcullis sticking up out of an otherwise picturesque grassy hillside.",

							"page": 106,
							"entries": [
								"Traps are obstacles for the characters to overcome. When planning a trap, consider whether or not you want the characters to find it. A trap that the characters are likely to find with ability checks or spells makes them expend resources overcoming the trap, as well as providing an interesting and exciting challenge.",
								"A trpa that the characters shouldn't be able to find, usually because the DC to spot it is very high, can provide a nasty surprise. It could serve as a warning that the characters aren't prepared to enter a specific area, or it can be something they stumble into to further the plot of the story you are telling.",
								"However, don't keep a trap hidden or make it extremely hard to find when it would certainly kill one or more of the characters or make it impossible for them to achieve their goal. The characters should have a fair chance to spot a trap that deadly and have a good shot at avoiding its effects. The point of such a trap is not, in fact, to kill anyone or to derail the adventure; it's to confront characters with a life-or-death, win-or-lose challenge that they must overcome. Realizing that everything is on the line has a wonderfully clarifying effect. To paraphrase Wiston Churchill, \"nothing in life is so exhilarating as being shot at and missed!\"",
								"It is always your responsibility as the GM to be prepared for the worst-case scenario when players encounter any traps you use or create. With this thought process as a guide, you can design traps that are not only clever and devious, but that also further the plot and heighten excitement."

								"At some point, your player characters may wish to build their own traps in your campaign. There are many ways to handle this scenario, and many details to consider.",
								"If a character tries to build a trap in the middle of a game, try to glean from the player what they're hoping the trap will accomplish. Then, consult {@book Chapter 9|TreTra|10} and use the {@table Trigger and Effect Generation table|TreTra|Random Trap Generator} to determine what trap trigger and effect would best suit their trap. If a player asks about this outside of the game, you may instead choose to explore this chapter with them and design a trap from the ground up together that best suits their character's needs.",
								"Other things to consider for character-created traps may include how long it takes to set up a trap of that type (digging a pit, rigging a hidden weapon, etc.) and what materials are needed to create the trap. It is up to your discretion as a GM to determine how realistic you wish the character's trap creation experience to be."

These leaves have many sensitive hair-like protrusions, and the trap only closes when two different hairs are touched within 20 seconds. This helps the plant avoid false triggers.",
								"A locked door with a swinging log hanging behind it, ready to smash any intruders, is a simple trap. But to keep inhabitants of the dungeon from being pulped, the engineer installed it with a multi-stage trigger. If the lock is disabled with {@item thieves' tools|phb}, and if the door is then opened, the trap activates. These measures prevent the trap going off when an unintended target unlocks the door with a key and opens it."

A successful Intelligence ({@skill History}, {@skill Nature}, or {@skill Religion}) check, depending on the context, can all provide these kinds of clues. The DC for these checks is based on the trap's severity.",
								"For example, if the characters are in a dungeon of some evil antagonist where countless other heroes have lost their lives, there is likely to be some information about the dungeon written down in books. An Intelligence ({@skill History}) check may be appropriate to reveal clues about possible magical triggers they may find (if anyone got out, able to tell the tale). While exploring the crypt of a long dead and once powerful paladin, searching for an ancient relic, an Intelligence ({@skill Religion}) check might reveal information about the tomb's defenses.",
								"Even if these checks don't give details about the traps themselves, they may give clues about those who might have set them, or important information that could be creatively applied to the situation.",
								"Traps can provide information even after they've been activated. Finding evidence of triggered traps\u2014such as corpses, burns, rubble, or blood\u2014can let characters know to be wary or that someone else is after the same thing they are."

Random tables are powerful tools to help break those patterns, because they force us to incorporate elements or combinations that wouldn't spring to mind naturally.",
						"In this chapter, you will find a set of tables for the two crucial parts of a trap: a trigger and an effect. The table doesn't do all of the work for you, but it does generate a concept. You can then flesh out the idea by deciding what the exact details of the trigger and effect are, how they work together, and how they fit into the space where they're found. You can use these tables to generate a trap on the fly, but they function best when you have time to consider all the possibilities and ramifications. Create a few traps in advance so that you have some options for just the right situation.",
						"The table contains 50 unique triggers and 50 unique effects. You can roll a {@dice d100} two times, using the first result to determine your trigger, and the second to determine your effect. You can also choose a combination of trigger and effect from the table, or you can choose one half of the trap and roll randomly for the other.",

								"Generating traps is not without its idiosyncrasies. Every combination of trigger and effect presented in this section can work together, but some may require a little extra thought.",
								"For example, consider a trap with a mundane trigger and a magic effect, such as a pressure plate that teleports the target to another location. The pressure plate could be in a narrow hallway, with a portal disguised as a mirror. When the target approaches to look into the mirror they step on the pressure plate, which catapults them into the portal.",
								"What about a magic trigger paired with a mundane effect? The target draws their weapon in the trap's range, making it cast {@spell produce flame} on a candle hidden in the ceiling. Just above the candle is a thin rope, from which hangs a jug filled with oil. Once the flame burns through the rope the jug falls to the ground, shattering and releasing the oil. The still burning rope tied to the jug ignites the oil and all creatures within a 20 foot radius are set ablaze."

Storytelling usually benefits from keeping a bit of information being from the main characters and then revealing that information at the moment that gives the best dramatic effect.

				"When you cast this spell, you inscribe a rune upon a surface (such as a table or a section of floor or wall), or on an object. If you choose a surface, the rune can cover an area of the surface no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If you choose an object, that object must remain in its place; if the object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the rune burns away, and the spell ends without being triggered.",
				"You can hide the rune in a larger design, but the rune is visible and can be spotted with a successful Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check. With a successful Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check, a creature that spots the rune can erase a portion of it, ending the spell without triggering it. The DC for both these checks is your spell save DC.",
				"You decide what triggers the rune when you cast this spell. For rune inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or standing on the rune, removing another object covering the rune, approaching within a certain distance of the rune, or manipulating the object on which the rune is inscribed. For glyphs inscribed on an object, the most common triggers include approaching within a certain distance of the object, or seeing or reading the rune.",
				"You can further refine the trigger so the rune activates only under certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight), creature kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect aberrations or drow), or alignment. You can also set conditions for creatures that don't trigger the rune, such as those who say a certain password.",
				"When the rune is triggered, it creates a Tiny, {@condition invisible}, mindless, shapeless force that only lasts long enough to interact with a nearby mechanical element, such as the workings of a trap, a lever, or a button. The mechanical element must be within 10 feet of the rune. Once the force interacts in this way, the spell ends and the rune fades away."
