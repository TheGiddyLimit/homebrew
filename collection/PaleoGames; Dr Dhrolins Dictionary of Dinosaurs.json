								"Palaeontology is a gateway science. That is, it is one of the first sciences that children and young adults are introduced to and acts as a point of entry for general scientific interest. It inspires awe in the natural world via the reconstruction of animals so dynamic that they seem like mythical monsters, as well as introducing topics like evolution that are fundamental for understanding the world around us. We have no doubt that, without it, many of the world’s top scientists would be in other careers.",
								"However, with this excitement and adoration comes an unusual negative side effect. Unlike most other sciences, palaeontology seems to hold a special place in people’s hearts, leading to a deep nostalgia for the toys and media that they experienced as a child. Notably, this includes monstrous depictions that echo inaccuracies of the earliest outdated reconstructions. Correcting those inaccuracies has generally been met with vicious opposition, ridicule, and claims that \"science is ruining dinosaurs\",  although it is worth noting that this has changed drastically in the last 10 years or so. While seemingly innocuous, this scientific dissidence has given space for a small, but vocal, group of science deniers to air their views. Those views are typically grounded in religious extremism, but have far- reaching consequences, particularly when they enter the school curriculum.",
								"In addition to the more serious concern outlined above, there are other issues caused by palaeontology’s unusual popularity and nostalgia. In public discourse, palaeontology functions more like pop culture, with large fan-based communities that idolise or despise particular scientists and their research. There is more to discuss there than we can adequately address in this book, but it is important to highlight some of the challenges faced by scientists while disseminating research.

										"{@ Academic} palaeontologists include scientific researchers, lecturers, and some research museum staff. A long career may encompass several or all of these aspects, as well as consultancy work for several industries. Academic palaeontologists require the most time and investment to achieve the level of education needed to fulfil their roles and there are few positions world-wide. This effort is rewarded by the opportunity to investigate and examine the best fossils in the world, as well as to be on the cutting edge of research.",
										"There is an unbelievable variety of research areas and working styles within academic palaeontology. Some spend almost their entire careers behind a computer screen, reading and re-evaluating decades-old datasets, others program complex analyses to determine evolutionary relationships, some examine and describe the characteristics of new species, some test the mechanics of fossil anatomy, and others undertake field excursions to examine rock outcrops. Many palaeontologists specialise in several areas and their jobs could include several such aspects, while others hyper-specialise in one specific attribute of one group of organisms.",
										"{@b Semi-academic} palaeontologists generally include field guides, museum staff, palaeoartists, and science communicators. Their work is vital for helping disseminate knowledge to the general public and the level of education among these individuals varies greatly. Some may have considerable education in palaeontology, including post-graduate studies, while others may be entirely self-educated.",
										"Caution must be used when listening to a self-proclaimed palaeontologist, as the field is prone to \"armchair experts\" who spread misinformation. For every real expert, there are a hundred misguided amateurs who repeat misinformation they read online, or even embellish it with further misinformation to garner greater traffic to their social media profiles. This is a serious issue within palaeontology that has real-world impacts.",
										"{@b  Palaeo-associated roles} include fossil preparators, fossil collectors, and fossil dealers. There is an entire industry around the extraction, cleaning, and sale of fossils, and these individuals facilitate it. They are typically not formally trained in palaeontology, but some can still be exceptionally knowledgeable. Their roles enable the safe recovery of millions of fossils that would otherwise be destroyed by weathering. The discovery of thousands of species can be attributed to non-academics such as these and their activities are an extremely important component of palaeontology as a whole. There is also a colossal community of people who fossil hunt as a hobby (including many of the academics and semi-academics). No formal education is required to be a fossil hunter, but it helps to have a good understanding of what you’re looking for."

The truth is that there are many ways in which an organism may be preserved in the fossil record (as outlined above by the types of fossils). It may seem obvious that slowing the processes of decay is the key factor, either through harsh environmental conditions (like extreme salt levels or total lack of oxygen) or rapid burial under metres of mud. In actuality, to preserve soft tissues, a fine balance is required between these preservational processes and decay itself. Decay is necessary to create chemical bonding sites for mineral deposition and to liberate elements from a carcass. These, in turn, create chemical gradients that stimulate mineral precipitation. We now also know that, in some situations, this process can occur within hours, rather than millions of years.",

										"Once palaeontologists have gathered enough information about an organism, they will often provide a reconstruction of the animal’s morphology and/or behaviour to provide a clearer picture of how the animal lived. This may be accompanied by a reconstruction of the environment in which it lived. Palaeontologists use a variety of techniques to reconstruct extinct animals, including functional morphology, comparative anatomy, phylogenetic bracketing, and an understanding of the animal’s environment.",
										"Functional morphology involves the study of the structure and movements of an organism’s tissues, and how they interact to allow for a particular function. This process is essentially reverse engineering – working out the task using only the tools. Functional morphology is combined with comparative anatomy to determine the most likely use and appearance of fossil tissues. Comparative anatomy is the comparison of the anatomy of extinct animals with the anatomy of living species. This allows palaeontologists to provide evidence of the possible uses of a particular tissue/organ/structure by watching similar structures being used in the modern world.",
										"These techniques are further combined with phylogenetic bracketing to extrapolate missing components of the fossil. Phylogenetic bracketing uses evolutionary relationships to infer the unknown characteristics of extinct organisms by looking at the known characteristics of closely related organisms. For example, if a new fossil wolf species is found only from bones, we can safely say that it was likely covered in fur, as all other known wolves (both alive and extinct) are covered in fur.",
										"Finally, the environmental context in which an extinct animal lived can also provide valuable information for its reconstruction. Paleontologists study the geological and paleontological context of fossil finds, including the types of rock formations, the climate and vegetation at the time, and the presence of other fossils. This information is used to understand the habitat and lifestyle of extinct animals and inform their reconstruction."

										"The Earth is about 4 billion years old. We know this because of a method called radiometric dating. Radiometric dating works by looking at the different types of atoms, called isotopes, that make up any given material, and how those atoms have changed over time. Certain isotopes are unstable and change into other types of atoms over time by giving off radiation. By measuring the amount of these isotopes in a rock or other material and comparing it to that isotope’s half-life, we can figure out how long it has been since that material formed.",
										"An isotope’s half-life is the amount of time it takes for half of the isotopes in a sample to change into a different isotope. For example, the isotope carbon-14 has a half- life of about 5,730 years, which means that if you start with a sample of carbon-14, after 5,730 years, half of the carbon-14 atoms in the sample will have changed into nitrogen-14 atoms. After another 5,730 years, half of the remaining carbon-14 atoms will have changed (so you would have only a quarter of what you started with), and so on.",
										"This works on much larger timescales too. For example, rock containing a lot of uranium-238 and very little lead-206, tells us that the rock is relatively young, because it hasn’t been around long enough for all of the uranium-238 to change into lead-206. Isotopes like this are not present in all rocks. They’re usually restricted to igneous and volcanic deposits, and so we have to estimate the age of different rocks by their nearest volcanic deposits. We can improve this estimate using biostratigraphy.",
										"Biostratigraphy is the process of establishing occurrence ranges of different fossil groups (usually in a place where radiometric dating can corroborate their age), then using those fossils to determine the age of rock elsewhere where radiometric dating cannot be used. The best fossils to use are those that had wide distributions and floated in water, like ammonites and graptolites. By determining the occurrence and absence of multiple groups, we can pinpoint a rather accurate age range of rocks that include these fossils.",
										"With all of this information, geologists have created the geological timescale, which is a way of dividing up Earth's history into different divisions and subdivisions of time. These divisions are determined by the types of rocks that formed and the major changes in fossil groups through Earth’s history. In this book, we focus on the Mesozoic era (252-66 million years ago), which is subdivided into the Triassic period (252-201 million years ago), Jurassic period (201-145 million years ago), and Cretaceous period (145-66 million years ago)."

										"Evolutionary theory is the foundation of our modern understanding of biology, ecology, and medicine, and misinformation about evolution is a genuine threat to everyone’s wellbeing. You’ve no doubt had people claim that evolution isn’t real or is \"just a theory\" (a misunderstanding of the term \"theory\"; in terms of science, a theory is the highest category of knowledge and understanding, and therefore also confidence, in an idea). These people are mistaken and, in our experience, usually have a political or religious agenda behind their statements. Regardless, evolution is observable and below is a brief summary of how it occurs in living organisms.",
										"Evolution is the process by which lineages of organisms change over time. When organisms reproduce, their offspring inherit a mix of traits from the parents (i.e. eye colour, hair colour, height, etc.) by the passing on of particular genes. Genes have heritability, which is the measurement of how variable their associated traits are. This allows a population of individuals to differ subtly, and if a particular variation increases an organism’s chances of survival, it will accumulate and spread within the population over time. The iconic example of this is a giraffe’s long neck. The gene that codes for neck length allows for some variation in length. Giraffes underwent a period where food was scarce, and so those with slightly longer necks were able to access more leaves on higher trees than others, increasing their survivability. Over time, fewer giraffes with short necks survived and reproduced, and the variance of neck length shifted to include longer necks and exclude shorter necks. This scarcity of food was a selection pressure, and the increased survivability of long-necked giraffes was natural selection at work.",
										"In addition to heritability, mutation contributes to the variability of offspring. None of us are identical to our parents, even when accounting for heritability. This is because errors can occur during gene replication and these result in further subtle variations. Most have little impact on the overall function of an organism. However, when they do and if they are advantageous, just like favourable heritability variations, they may then propagate within a community.",
										"While the survival of individuals is important, there are also factors that influence the survival of groups of closely related organisms. A trait that appears detrimental to one individual’s reproductive success can be advantageous for other closely related individuals, and so despite the first individual not producing offspring, the gene coding for it is propagated in the offspring of their relatives. There are many examples of this, with the most heavily investigated example being homosexuality. Competing hypotheses have been presented to precisely explain the origin of this trait (see “Evolution of Homosexuality” by Savolainen and Hodgson), but its occurrence across the animal kingdom (including in mammals, birds, reptiles, and insects) is indicative of its role in group survival.",
										"There is another key process in evolution. A group of individuals that become isolated from other members of their species may be affected by different selection pressures. After many generations, these different pressures cause them to become so different genetically that they can no longer successfully interbreed with their former species if they were to return. In essence, this causes them to become a new species and is a process we called speciation. When enough changes accrue over thousands of generations, the new species can look drastically different and eventually they may differ enough that we categorise them as an entirely new group of organisms."

												"In Earth’s early history, abiotic (non-living) chemical processes created simple molecules similar to the individual bases of ribonucleic acid (RNA) and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in a water medium. This is sometimes referred to as “primordial soup”. These molecules are not alive, but their structure stimulates the formation of another paired molecule adjacent to them, which in turn allows self-replication of the original molecule.",
												"When the first molecules like these were encased in oily bubbles, they formed the basis from which all life evolved. The individual bases were small enough to move freely in/out of each oily bubble, but when they first form chains within an oily bubble, they became too large to leave and the first “protocells” were formed. Chains of bases replicated themselves, and the replicated base chains were also constrained within the protocell.",
												"Osmotic pressure created by these chained bases made the protocell more physically resistant than bubbles without internal molecules. This allowed protocells to absorb smaller, less resistant bubbles, causing them to grow in size.",
												"As they increased in size, with more molecule chains forming inside them, they eventually reached a size where the physical flow of water broke them apart, with each subsequent protocell containing some of the internal molecules. This is the origin of reproduction.",
												"Some chains of molecules were able to interact with other types of molecules (namely amino acids, which also can occur naturally), causing those molecules to form chains where they wouldn’t normally. These chains of amino acids formed proteins.",
												"In certain proteins, the chains of amino acids form at angles, causing the protein to fold or curve. This, in turn, can cause a complex interplay of atoms positioned around a particular point that creates an area on the protein that functions chemically. We call this an active site.",
												"Any protein that increased the resistance of the protocell, or increased the speed/efficiency that it replicated, passively propagated more than others. This was the first occurrence of evolution and essentially the start of life. Every single iteration and development of life as we know it was a derivation of this process."

Why would these individuals want to re-animate such creatures? Are they academic curiosities, weapons of war, or flights of fancy for a rich benefactor? Could they be all three? We like to envision Necromancer Island as the pursuit of several powerful wizards, driven by academic curiosity, but funded by a mysterious noble. The motives of that noble remain a unknown, but the avarice of the wizards keeps them from asking further questions. You can flesh out the background of that mysterious noble in any manner of ways.

What would happen if these creatures escaped from Necromancer Island, either by their own means or by sabotage?! The various planes of existence offer even more variety to the consequence of this.

Tiny ice crystals drifted suspended in the air, stinging at Dr Dhrolin’s skin as he moved through the building. Eventually, the group reached a grand hall.

Alternatively, they could be a master of this power and you could construct a dungeon or fortress deep in an ancient environment for them to hide in.",
								"Regardless, the first question to address is how the players get there. There are at least three possible answers. The players could be chasing the Chronoficer, who takes refuge by activating their time machine. This might force the players to follow through a portal or seek another means to pursue their foe. Perhaps they could arrive before the Chronoficer, giving them time to prepare an ambush, or perhaps long after the Chronoficer has fortified their hideout. The second possible option is that the Chronoficer simply sends the players through time in an attempt to dispose of them. This could result in a tense and gritty survival situation, where the players need to stay alive until the magic wears off or they find another means to travel back. Finally, the players may work with the Chronoficer to travel through time intentionally, perhaps to retrieve a long-destroyed artifact or prevent some past catastrophe. You can put a lot of creativity into imagining the device that allows your players to travel through time. It could be a simple circular portal embedded in an ancient temple. Stepping through it brings you back out in the exact same spot, but in a vastly different time. Perhaps the device is a rideable steam-punkesque machine that the party can sit in. Whirling cogs and hissing pistons encompass the party as the world spins around them. Or, on a much grander scale, the device could be an entire castle capable of magical transportation. Blinking in and out of existence as it shifts through time, acting as a base of operations for your players. When constructing a story like this, it’s important to provide multiple means of returning the players back to their normal timeline. The last thing you want is to have a singular fragile device that is immediately destroyed upon the party’s arrival (unless of course that is your intention!). We recommend using some of the examples above as contingency in case the party becomes stranded."

										"{@i One such Chronoficer is the dragonborn Miss Nemona Hemsworth-Pennyfarthing. Born and raised in Urgleshire noble district, she was the child of a union between the Hemsworth and Pennyfarthing households, who both sought to consolidate their dwindling political power through the marriage of Miss Myarya Hemsworth and Sir Garroguk Pennyfarthing. Nemona grew up as an isolated child, busying herself with the study of engineering and the invention of her own mechanical toys. As she aged, this hobby grew into a passion, then an obsession. By the chance finding of a tome of temporal studies in her father’s library, she dove into chronological research, enamoured by this new science. She is the sole heir to both the Hemsworth and Pennyfarthing estates and this wealth allowed her to construct a bespoke laboratory within the confines of her properties.}",
										"{@i Despite her family’s efforts, her interest in politics, marriage, and the continuation of the joined family name was limited. Instead, she poured her time into her research. When anomalies began to form in her laboratory, she shielded her family from the truth, burying as much evidence as she could.}",
										"{@i Inevitably, a catastrophic disaster struck and pulled two large predatory dinosaurs into her time. Unleashed upon the Pennyfarthing estate, they subsequently slew both Myarya and Garroguk before she was able to return them to their time. It was at this point that the authorities began to investigate. However, with her parents dead and the invading dinosaurs returned, Nemona had unlimited access to her family’s wealth. In her grief, she sought to undo her mistakes – leading to several grievous errors and major prehistoric incursions. In their wake, Urgleshire authorities opted to dispatch an adventuring party headed by Dr Dhrolin to the Pennyfarthing manor to investigate these strange occurrences."
