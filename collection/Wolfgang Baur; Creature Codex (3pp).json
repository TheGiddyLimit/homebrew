Umbral is the language of the shadow elves, a corrupted dialect of Elvish, and spoken by most creatures of shadow. Those who speak it can gain a +1 to one Dexterity (Stealth) check 1/day. 
    
Void Speech is the language of the Outer Darkness in the Midgard campaign setting, spoken by vile things that are malevolent towards humans and their allies, and who seek to bring about the ruinous apocalypse of the dark gods. Substitute any ancient language with an evil reputation if you are using another setting.
