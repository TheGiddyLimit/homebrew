				"This new skill in Dark Matter governs how well one can manipulate a technological interface and gain access to information or other functions. Your Intelligence (Data) check encompasses your knowledge of software and its exploits, more than hardware (which is covered by the Technology skill), and so will only be used when you use technology that has an interface, like a datapad, an arcane terminal, a ship's computer, or other control technology, like a door control or the computers that govern a {@item shield generator|darkmatter} or ship weapon. If a piece of technology doesn't have an interface, an interface rig is required to interact with it. The GM should call for an Intelligence (Data) check whenever you attempt complicated operations on a data system, when you attempt to reprogram a construct, or when you attempt to hack a device.",
				"Any sort of illegal or unauthorized access to a technological system is called Hacking and requires the use of an {@item interface rig|darkmatter}, as well as an Intelligence (Data) check. In general, a hacking attempt requires 1 minute of work using the technology, though the GM can decide that certain tasks might take only an action. On a successful check to hack a device, you can perform operations on the system as if you had full access. On a failed check, roll a d6. On a 6, the device locks down and no further attempts can be made to hack it. More secure devices might lock on a roll of 5 or 6, or on a roll of 4 to 6, as determined by the GM. You can hack into devices to illegally access a security system, open a door, disable an alarm, or manipulate someone else's datapad to give you access to their information or bank account."

An exile has a unique opportunity to absorb foreign cultures and contact émigré communities while rallying support remotely. Living in exile might provide benefits that aren't available back home, such as the freedom to pursue otherwise forbidden love interests or take advantage of more lenient tax policies, either of which could deliver the impetus to accept a self-imposed exile.",

For some, their exile was only temporary, and now they seek to embark on a dangerous journey home, while others might seek to foment rebellion in absentia so as to be welcomed as liberating heroes on their return.

						"As a general rule, magic doesn't exist in science fiction.

						"In other words, magical things can always be dismissed with science.",
						"When you dive into the universe of Dark Matter, you'll find that quite the inverse is true: magic has become so advanced that it seems like high technology. Those blasters are highly-developed evocation wands, that flying car is using a permanent levitate spell, and traveling faster than the speed of light is simply an advanced application of teleportation magic.",
						"In Dark Matter, fantasy and science fiction can live side-by-side: the universe is filled to the brim with huge starships, innumerable alien creatures and planets, and all sorts of blasters, jetpacks, and power armor. It's also populated with dragons, demons, giants, and strange alien creatures to be met and slain. Axe-wielding barbarians clad in furs can stand alongside machine-gun toting androids, facing down alien horrors on the deck of a derelict space cruiser; trinket-festooned wizards and power armored space commandos can plot together to take down a dragon that lives in an asteroid made of solid gold; and lute-strumming bards can perform and garner fame in every hive of scum and villainy on the outer rim of the galaxy.",
						"At its core, Dark Matter is a love letter to our favorite science fiction franchises, and an acknowledgment that science fiction in general need not be divorced from fantasy. The best sci-fi, from Star Wars to Dune, is filled with fantastic elements: mystical space-wizards, laser swords, precognition, and unusual alien abilities, to name a few. None of them seem all that out of place in high fantasy, yet the two are irreparably divorced. Of course, the distinction is mostly an aesthetic one\u2014sci-fi outfits its magic in sleek metal, whereas high fantasy uses glowing arcane runes. Dark Matter is our attempt to bridge that gap.",
						"Somewhere out there in the Dark Matter universe, every conceivable world\u2014from the medieval domains of wizards and dragons to the high-tech alien planets of your favorite sci-fi franchise\u2014waits to be discovered. Your own campaign world is out there, too, perhaps blissfully unaware that alien starships dogfight high above, exchanging blaster fire for the fate of the galaxy.",

										"\"What can I say? You've got a good arm there.\"",
										"He grinned and flexed a little, puffing out his chest like some kind of damn Sepulcher Knight. \"So? You gonna give the old man his map back then? Or do I got to hit you again?\"",
										"Rami knew that this small prison, tucked away in the bowels of the Solar Citadel, held only two types of prisoners: immensely powerful criminals apprehended by the Sepulcher Knights, and dumb thugs like this one, who tried one too many times to escape their previous jail. Moreover, one of the few things that might prompt an intervention from the bird-headed would be the death of a prisoner. She would have to tread lightly; loosing the full force of her power against this fool could spoil her eventual escape, or worse, cost her the map.",
										"And besides, it was much more fun if they thought they stood a chance. Rami muttered a word and flicked her wrist, summoning a spectral hand to slap him full in the face. \"Bold of you to assume you can.\"",
										"His smirk evaporated. \"Oh, you're real funny, grue, but you sure ain't smart. You even know who the old man is? He's a Scale & Fang elite, they say. Got connections across the 'verse.\"",
										"Rami's yellow eyes sparkled. \"Why do you think I got myself locked up here with him? He might have been an elite back in the day, but it didn't exactly take long to... persuade him to part with this.\"",
										"\"You black-hearted wretch!\" the thug shouted as he threw another clumsy hook.",
										"A few seconds later, he was sprawled out on the canteen floor and the rest of his gang were preparing to pile in. Clearly the old man had never stopped making friends. Every lowlife in this place seemed to have his back. Rami dug through her memory for a spell which didn't require material components. Invisibility? No, that needs gum arabic. Silent image? Rami doubted her roughspun fatigues would count as fleece. Aha! Sleep might do the trick: Rami reached for a pinch of sand\u2014the Citadel's floor held no shortage of that\u2014and started forming somatic components.",
										"The faces of Rami's opponents exhibited a mixture of confusion and concern as she enchanted the sand, then a brief flash of horror as the bewitched grains flew towards the corners of their eyes. Within moments, a half-dozen of them had drifted off to sleep and collapsed in a pile. Rami sensed her opening.",
										"She darted forward, evading one thug and shoving another back with a gust of magical wind. One managed to hit her with a thrown boot, but the glancing blow didn't slow her dash toward the exit.",
										"To her shock, the door swung open and a trio of avia-ra wardens strode in, golden sunstaves ablaze with radiant energy. Wordless, they set about the room, smiting prisoners left and right as if putting down a full-scale riot. Which perhaps it was, in their view; this wasn't the sort of dungeon that usually inspired its inmates to rampage.",

Maintaining this peace and neutrality are two unique groups: the amoeboids, a caretaker race of vaguely humanoid, translucent oozes native to the maws, and the Order of the Sepulcher, a relatively new organization of peacekeepers. Though the elves were the first humanoid race to discover and use the maws for their intended purpose, their creation and creator are shrouded in mystery. Only a few pieces of that mystery have been uncovered, the most prominent being the amoeboids themselves. Given that they are the only creatures native to the maws, they seem to be tasked with the continued upkeep and maintenance of the stations, and are especially apt to do so. However, the amoeboids' histories contain no record of their origins, or indeed, on the origins of the maws. Galactic Frontier.

Encountering them is practically dizzying for first-time visitors to a maw: their eerily transparent bodies flash with dim organic lights, shapeshifting into vague forms and imperfect copies of various creatures, all accompanied by a strange hum of blurbles and tones. Though the universe excels in producing creatures of diverse shapes and sizes, the amoeboids are something truly unique.",
										"Moreover, amoeboids are gifted with exceptional intelligence, and many possess a natural talent with machines. They were among the first space-bound races (the first, if one considers their origin), and remain pioneers in Dark Matter technology. Most amoeboids place tremendous faith in scientific reasoning, to the extent that a sound statistical model will often be more convincing than reported events. This, of course, extends to magical research, and amoeboid technology rests at the cutting- edge intersection of science and arcana.",
										"Such unique humanoids ought to come from an equally unique homeworld, but this is not the case; amoeboids were simply discovered on the maws.

After all, nothing so fantastic could be a mere coincidence; the maws are a ready-made transit network, connecting the far reaches of the galaxy, complete with a resident race of shapeshifters intelligent enough to understand them and skilled enough to maintain them. Indeed, most races would likely have never discovered Dark Matter technology without observing the maw stations firsthand. Every technological discovery is built on the shoulders of giants, but in this case, the giants have gone mysteriously absent.",
												"More perplexing is that the maws are not merely technological in nature; they are constructed atop colossal skeletons of long-dead creatures. The bones themselves seem critically important, for it is impossible to create a stable maw portal without them, but what role they play is completely baffling to researchers. Moreover, it's unclear what type of creature left the bones, for nothing alive today even remotely resembles them. Are these creatures extinct, or simply yet undiscovered? Do they originate from inside the galaxy, or even from within our universe?",
												"For their part, the amoeboids have few answers to the Grand Mystery; their origins are as inscrutable to them as anyone else. The earliest amoeboid records date to the first instances of amoeboids, learning how to interface with maw terminals and record data, perhaps a century after the supposed \"zero\" generation. Before that is a short but impenetrable dark age stretching back to the activation of the maws and obscuring their origin.",
												"It is in their nature to search for answers from a scientific frame of reference, but real evidence has been elusive so far. Speculation points to Old Un being involved in the Mystery, but what role he played is unclear. Perhaps the Grand Mystery has been intentionally obscured by a powerful creator or creators, or perhaps all involved are missing some critical piece, some insight that links the amoeboids, the maws, and their enigmatic creation."

This single database, a collection of nearly everything known to them, is a scientific marvel, a monument to all amoeboid achievement.",

The sole exception to non-involvement is with spacefaring races that have journeyed to the maws themselves; the amoeboids greet such groups as equals, and welcome them with access to the galactic community."

Hailing from Kemet, a harsh, desert planet, crisscrossed by rivers and lakes, they have always known an appreciation for the sun's blessings and cruelties, which forms the backbone of their religion, inspires their arts and sciences, and informs their view of the cosmos. Their dogma centers squarely on their deity and holy star, the Sun Above, to which there can be no equal.",

Suddenly, their Sun Above was no longer Deshret, the star around which their homeworld orbits, but a theoretical \"true star\" from which all stars, including their own, derive meaning. It was centuries before they ventured to the center of the galaxy and encountered what they consider the physical embodiment of the Sun Above: the Sepulcher Star.",
										"In those days, the Sepulcher Star orbited much further from the black hole at the galactic core, and it was definitively under elven control. The avia-ra soon learned from the elves that the Sepulcher Star wasn't merely a star, but contained some sort of supermassive construct within. Though strictly an academic curiosity to the elves, this discovery galvanized the avia-ra: in the heart of this star, near the exact center of the galaxy, was their Sun Above. Over the next few centuries, the avia-ra quietly bolstered and gathered their fleets in preparation for the First Crusade.",

Each crusade was punctuated with the signing of a treaty, a respite from battle, and a consolidation of forces. Always, a surprise attack by one of the two sides reignited the conflict anew. In the Third Crusade, the avia-ra constructed the massive Solar Citadel in orbit around the Sepulcher Star\u2014a holy city, built for the glory of the Sun Above and to deter elven aggression.

The ensuing retreat made an opening for the Elven Forest-Fleet, which encircled the Congregation, spelling the end of the Crusade.

After all, their pantheons are extensive and integral to their societies; a monotheistic god has little place among them. Instead, the avia-ra have turned to primitive civilizations, especially those on undiscovered planets, with which to share their message.",
												"The pattern for their evangelism is simple: build a civilization on an undeveloped world, founded on the philosophy of their solar religion, reside with it long enough to ensure it leaves a lasting legacy, and depart once again for the stars. In the avia-ra religion, all worship of the sun is indirectly worship of the Sun Above, so any evolution their gods of light and flame take on with the passing of centuries is inconsequential; they are still effigies of Old Un in the Sepulcher Star.",
												"This practice is controversial, to say the least. Many worlds have ancient tales of travelers from other worlds, bringing with them the blessings of the Sun, and these depictions paint them much like gods themselves. Humans, especially, have a sore spot for this sort of unfair proselytizing\u2014High Terra was an early target for avia-ra evangelists. Elves and dwarves hold their own pantheons as sacred, and condemn avia-ra missionaries as a whole, but there is little that the galactic community can do, short of inciting galactic war.

When they began expanding out into the galaxy at large, they found that, although Jormund was host to all manner of life, the surrounding systems were barren. What they lacked in inhabitants, however, they made up for in mineral wealth. True to their nature, the dwarves turned their skill, magic, and technology towards the mining of these planets, and converted the influx of material into the largest mining and freighting fleet in the galaxy.

Embedded deep below the surface of Nebellion, gnomish explorers discovered what appeared to be a city-sized disc made of unknown metals, filled not with scientific marvels, but nonfunctional arcane devices. They also discovered the burnt-out remnants of a Dark Matter engine, and from there proceeded to reverse-engineer their way into the stars. Despite the fact that most of the enchanted objects (including those which seem to be recordings or record keepers) located on the vessel were intact, years of testing yielded no results; no form of gnomish power could cause them to spring to life, and even re-introduction to magic outside the Dead Magic Zone proved fruitless. To this day, it remains a mystery as to who landed on Nebellion, how long ago they landed, and how they traversed the Zone with such a vessel.",
												"What isn't a mystery is the effect the disc's discovery had on gnomish society. Within fifteen years, the Traversal Guild had managed to create a functioning, low-class Dark Matter engine powered by fuel sources known to them. Five years later, they perfected the new technology and achieved spaceflight. Within fifty years, the gnomes had breached the edges of the Zone, reached the maw nearest to Nebellion, and discovered their place in the 'verse. The whole of gnomish society refocused their efforts, and in another 50 years' time, the beginnings of the Great Gnomish Flotilla launched from the Nebellion shipyards, carrying seventy-five percent of their population with it."

The gnomes live in an essentially post- scarcity society, and most devote their time and energy to invention, exploration, artistic endeavors, or learning. Surprisingly few true adventurers come out of either the Flotilla or of Nebellion proper, as gnomes tend to be risk-averse if they can afford to be. Still, star gnomes are highly sought-after as ship's engineers, pilots, and technologists, and their tech is highly valued for its ability to function perfectly in Dead Magic Zones.",

The Council of Six rules as a democratically elected council comprised of members from each of the six guilds which have governed the planet's year-to-year workings for centuries: The Craftsman's Guild (Mechanical and Technological works), The Mason's Guild (Large Scale Construction works), the Baker's Guild (Agriculture and Sustainability works), The Traversal Guild (Exploration and Expansion projects), The Windmill Guild (Power Efficiency and Generation projects), and The Artisan's Guild (Cultural projects and Artworks). Conversely, the Admiralty is governed by the Flotilla's current Admiral and his subordinate officers. Each ship in the flotilla is like an independent state: free to do as its needs dictate, but still required to report to the Admiral when called.",

Additionally, A.I. offers swift, discreet travel services between over three thousand different ports of call, including every maw on the grid. If you need to get somewhere or find something, no one in the 'verse is going to do it faster than Astrogations Inc.",
										"The greatest problem A.I. faces is that, unlike terrestrial cartography, the \"topology\" of the 'verse is in constant flux. While some points (such as the maw stations) rotate about the galactic core in relatively fixed positions, there are enough spatial anomalies, rogue planets, and gravitational channels to keep a dedicated mapmaker busy for several lifetimes; this doesn't even consider the trouble of keeping the galactic governmental demarcations accurate and true. Even small changes in gravitational pull on a trade route could send a freighter plunging into a star, so extremely accurate charts are imperative.",
										"To this end, A.I. deals in information of all kinds, purchasing star charts, planet scans, void jump data, and scans of anomalous events from explorers and spacers alike. This very information is cataloged and sold back to spacers to help refine navigation, dealt to the major galactic powers to define their borders, and used by spellcasters to accurately cast the astrogation spell, the company's namesake. Perfectly neutral in its dealings, A.I. will buy or sell from any willing customer, as long as doing so will turn a profit. The A.I. headquarters, located on Concordia, is said to possess hundreds of thousands of arcane terminals to store and collate its data.",

Long ago, A.I cartographers realized that, while the predictions of one psychic might be unreliable, the average of a hundred or more can yield consistently true results, even out to years in the future. It is even possible that A.I.'s psychic think-tank has predicted more than just the future of galactic movements; that their psychics have divined great cataclysms that await the 'verse. Of course, if that were true, A.I. has remained silent on the matter, perhaps wishing to turn this information to profit in the future."

The Cabal is an enterprising office of soul brokers, who arrange lucrative contracts in exchange for parts of a signee's soul. Such contracts are fair, clearly spelled-out, and never offered unsolicited; moreover, most contracts exchange only a percentage of the signee's soul for a disbursement. One percent of a soul could be worth a few thousand credits, whereas ten percent could buy a brand-new starship, place a down payment on a house, and leave some left over in the bank. Signees are free to decide from a number of generous disbursement packages and receive prompt payment for their souls.",
										"This method of soul contracting isn't just efficient, but it represents a triumph of the free market. The soul brokers who work for the Cabal need not worry about signing mortal bargains for entire souls at once; they each collect dozens of souls a year, taken from hundreds of different signees. Those who sign such contracts need not worry about being damned to the Lower Planes for eternity as a part of their bargain; instead, they can (probably) expect their afterlives will be merely tarnished, as only part of their eternal soul ascends. They can even return to sign additional contracts. Best of all, the process doesn't require any tiresome blood rituals or fiendish temptation, as the Cabal operates out of ordinary office buildings.",
										"The Cabal was founded by Mr. Bell, secretly a high- ranking devil named Belphagor. At the time he arrived on the Material Plane, soul trading was a clumsy affair, requiring a creature to trade its entire soul for one favor, which was rarely as valuable as the soul itself. While this system meant that devils almost always profited on their deals, it also meant that far fewer creatures were willing to barter with them. To remedy this, Belphagor derived the exact monetary value for a mortal soul and a system by which to trade away only a small portion of it. Before long, human greed and the free market ran away with the idea. Belphagor no longer needed to send imps to haggle with mortals; they were coming to him. Under the guise of Mr. Bell, he purchased an office, hired a staff of tieflings, and opened for business as the Cabal.",

While these numbers pale in comparison to the military might of the elves, dwarves, or humans, Coalition soldiers are exceptionally well-trained and equipped, making them more than a match for any combatant. Though Coalition soldiers can be hired as bodyguards or mercenaries, the Coalition's specialty is turning the tide of galactic conflict (for the right price).",
										"The Coalition is led by a council of generals, admirals, and sky marshals called the War Room. This council of military experts debates tactics, establishes new military doctrine, and even deliberates on changes to the Coalition soldier's basic uniform. The War Room is presided over by the current High Lord Marshal, Tiberious Vinter, an imposing half-orc with nearly a century of combat experience and a prodigiously impressive beard. In the War Room, the High Lord Marshal's word is law and his decisions are final; and to his credit, Marshal Vinter rarely makes decisions rashly or without deliberation. He and his council are all too aware that their actions carry the weight of millions of lives, which none of them take lightly.",
										"Though the Coalition will join any war effort which can afford their services, all of its soldiers abide by a strict code of warfare. This code prohibits slavery, genocide, planetary destruction (excluding Tier 4 and 5 worlds), and out-and-out piracy. Any soldier or officer found to be engaging in such activity will be immediately censured and subjected to military tribunal. As such, even though the Coalition operates in the same theater as other mercenary groups, such as Grax's Guys and Scale and Fang, they are treated with a measure of respect that elevates them from the competition.",
										"Next to its incredible armada, the Coalition's greatest asset might be its chapter of warmages. During the Rift War of humanity, the old Warmage College was split between fighting the Elven Forest-Fleet for the Alliance or fighting the Orcish Warhorde with Lakshay. When the dust settled, Lakshay separated from the Alliance and the College of Warmages pledged their devotion to the new government of Lakshay. Warmage loyalists were appalled, and many defected to join the Coalition, a force they saw as a neutral camp between the alliances of humanity. Today, the Coalition employs its warmages as a cutting-edge force of arcane troops, blending combative magic with new technology, giving Coalition forces an unparalleled tactical advantage on the field of battle."

Their tagline \"You can trust Grax!\" can be seen advertised in almost every port in the 'verse.",

										"And indeed it was, but once their Freelancer was clear of the station, they were away quickly, launching into a void jump moments after passing through the hangar doors. A blind jump, yes, but one Nano was familiar with. Besides, the Miaam-Osk Pathway had long been a favorite route for both smugglers and legitimate merchants, so even if the jump wasn't entirely accurate, there would be enough beacons, signals and landmark planetoids to get back on track.",
										"As the ship progressed through the void, Rami popped back to the bridge. \"If them Firm boys are anywhere, they'll be in the Whiteglass cluster at the far edge of the Miaam system. The asteroids there block all divination magic somehow. It's a good place to hide...\"",
										"\"...but it also means they won't be able to see us coming.\" Mekhet-Nu finished the thought.",
										"\"Excellent. Let's go steal us an arcane warhead.\"",
										"Sure enough, they touched down on one of the icy asteroids without any kind of interception. \"Are you sure they're here?\" asked Mekhet-Nu, while he nonetheless readied his sunstaff in a battle stance.",

										"\"Set up?\" Rami tried to ask, but another hail of fire came in, shattering the gadgeteer's temporary dome. Hitting the deck, she used a cantrip to raise a low wall out of ice. \"Blast it, Mek, get down!\"",
										"The avia-ra, several scorch marks already burned into his muscular chest, squawked as he fired his sunstaff into the attackers, but soon realized that Rami had a point. Against so many, defensive measures would be necessary.",
										"The two of them exchanged shots with the smugglers, pinning some of them down, but doing little to reduce their numerical advantage. Before long, Firm gunmen were moving into flanking positions, and one of their leaders shouted: \"I don't know who you are, but anyone who thinks they can barge onto our asteroid and get away alive can't be very smart! We'll be taking that ship, too!\"",
										"Just then, Nano stopped working on a turret-like device. \"Don't count your roaches before you've jumped, fleshbag!\" The device then began to glow.",
										"\"Is that... should we...?\" Rami stammered.",
										"\"Yes, we should probably get out of the way. The targeting matrix in this is kind of... improvised.\"",
										"The three of them scrambled away, just in time to see Nano's hastily-constructed turret let loose a beam of crackling energy, which then proceeded to sweep through the ranks of assailants, jerking up and down to eliminate targets both near and far.",
										"When the screeching turret at last quieted, Nano was the first to speak. \"Well, they aren't storing the warhead on the surface at least. Thankfully for us. Come on, it must be somewhere inside.\"\""

Moreover, a ship must be in good standing with a territory to gain access to its star charts, though large factions routinely circumvent this, offering charts to any ships in their employ.",

If you spend 24 hours conducting a planetary scan, you also learn whether the planet's surface is inhabited, what general level of technology said inhabitants seem to possess (by detecting the presence of bronze, iron, steel, uranium, etc.), and its weather patterns over the next 24 hours.",

Doing so allows you to gain a full 24-hour scan of the planet in 1 hour, but destroys the probe in the process.",
										"Information gained from planetary scans are stored on your ship's computer and can be later sold to interested parties, such as Astrogations Inc.

Life support is busted too, but I've managed to rig the air filter up so we won't suffocate. At least, for a while. Also, while I was down there, I noticed that the antivirus module on the computer seems to be overheating... What do you reckon that's all about, Nano?\"",

Dragon's fire rushed outward from the breastplate, ejecting spouts of flame at every bolt and joint. As the flames reached the golem's extremities, its hands clenched and its head turned to see its creator.",

Perhaps the planetoid used to be solid, but encountered a catastrophe of epic proportions, shattering the planet and heavily magnetizing the core.

No force maintains an artificial gravity on the flat planetoid, so all of its water congregates in a spherical ocean, atop the gravitational center. On this small ocean, gravity would appear to behave normally, but venturing further out onto the coin would reveal that gravity always points to the center, making the flat surface feel like a slope that grows ever steeper as one nears the edge."

Other than this bizarre construction, which relegates its north and south poles to the top and bottom faces of the cube, and bombards the other faces with intermittent but immense storms, this planet seems devoid of construction. How it maintains this shape is a mystery. The rest of its solar system, too, has perplexing geometries. It's nearest neighboring planet (whose orbit is closer to the parent star) is shaped as a tetrahedron, and its next nearest neighbor (further away from the star) is octahedral. The other two more distant planets have equally geometrical constructions. Most perplexing, the star itself (named Icosahedrax) has 20 sides, and radiates varying amounts of heat from its edges and its vertices. This star, too, seems more like a divine accident than a physical construction."

What it eats and how it propels itself through space is a mystery.

It is climate-controlled to have year-round balmy weather and mild seasons. Even the wild food growing here is abundant and delicious. As perfect as it might seem, underneath the ground is a mechanical hellscape in charge of maintaining conditions on the surface. Those that live here are little more than a servant population, held under despotic rule and charged with maintenance on the 'Paradise Machine.'"

It is not simply that the land takes on a grim or beautiful aspect as its light changes; it seems that two planets literally occupy the same space here, alternating at dawn and dusk. Moreover, the two worlds are fully disparate, for where one might have a temple and a shaded forest, the other has a lake of lava and a craggy mountain. Only visitors to this world seem to notice the shift. Unattended objects, including those brought by visitors, and the planet's residents (monstrous and otherwise) simply vanish when the shift occurs, and reappear when their world returns."

Exploiting their nature as living constructs, vect pilots plug directly into their ships, creating something of a hybrid intelligence, split between the pilot, the ship, and the swarm as a whole. The link is inherently frail; removing the pilot incorrectly or critically damaging the ship invariably results in a ship-wide detonation.",

Though most gadgeteers are at least curious about the underlying mysteries of the universe, many view groundbreaking scientific discoveries as a means to an end; theory only exists to facilitate application.",

Some gadgeteers become absorbed in a particular problem, innovating and optimizing solutions for it alone, while others devise technological marvels wherever they can find application.

The mechanics of most of these devices need not be changed, for technology in Dark Matter is also generally powered by magic.",
