							"You can use an action while holding the axe to speak its command word and create a swirling, luminescent fog around you in a 20-foot-radius sphere. The fog remains at that location for up to 1 minute, even if you move, or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it. The fog heavily obscures the area, and any creature that enters the fog or starts its turn there (other than you) must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be affected by the {@spell hypnotic pattern} spell. The spell ends early for a creature if it takes any damage, and it ends early for all affected creatures if the fog is dispersed. Once a creature succeeds on the saving throw or the spell ends for it, it automatically succeeds on its saving throws against this effect for the next 24 hours. Once this property of the axe has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn."
