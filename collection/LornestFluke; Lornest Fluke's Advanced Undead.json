When you raise a skeleton from the grave with {@spell animate dead|LornestflukesAdvancedUndead|}, you are not \"puppeting\" the creatures body like you would with {@spell animate objects}. Rather, you are providing the corpse with a tenuous connection to the plane of negative energy, allowing the bones to move as they did in life. This is also why undead tend to attack the living when freed from their arcane leashes."

								"This book heavily alters the flavor and base playstyle of a necromancer, so it might be prudent for me to leave a collection of little things to remember, right here at the top.",
								"Skeletal creatures are habitual, and getting them to learn new things is extremely hard without the use of {@spell boneshaping|LornestFlukesAdvancedUndead|magic}. All their skills and proficiencies are determined by the memories of the bones they are made of. If you are playing a necromancer, it might be a good idea to gather bones from trained soldiers if you wish to give your skeletons such skills. {@bold Keep in mind}, all LAU creature statblocks are made with proficiency bonuses already factored in, if the bones you use do {@italic not} have the appropriate skills, dont forget to subtract it.",
								"If you are DMing {@italic for} a necromancer, keep in mind that (assuming they have picked up {@spell boneshaping|LornestFlukesAdvancedUndead}) once they have obtained the bones of a skilled swordsman or archer, they can replicate those proficiencies forever, but {@italic not} the body as a whole. Certain intricacies are lost in translation during the use of boneshaping, and duplicating every bone from the body of a skilled warrior will not provide them with a perfect copy. Instead, they will have a skeleton with the same proficiencies, but not the subtler skills. All this to say, duplicating a skeleton does not provide a suitable replacement for creations that require a skeleton from a specific profession or trade, eg. a {@creature diplomat|LornestFlukesAdvancedUndead|}, or {@creature ossein knight|LornestFlukesAdvancedUndead|}.",
								"Legs will walk, hands will grasp, spines will curve, and skulls will stare, but these rules are not concrete. When placed in a humanoid configuration, humanoid bones will do what is expected. But when you start to use bones in an unfamiliar configuration, you will be surprised to learn that they will still fuction, just perhaps in unexpected and suboptimal ways. Some things are too different however, like wings. Wings must almost always be constructed from the bones of a creature that flies, and the same applies to skeletal creations in the water, or those that dig under the earth. These environments and their modes of locomotion are alien to the bones of a dwarf or human, and you will need to find (or create) appropriately skilled bones.",
								"All skeletal undead are assumed to have the following traits: They may take a long rest by resting with minimal movement for 4 hours. They do not need to eat, sleep, or breathe. They do not age.",
								"In places laden with necromantic magic, or areas close to/similar to the plane of negative energy, feral undead might form. Most likely not as neatly constructed as a necromancer's companions, these creatures could have strange mish-mashed abilities. They may also develop vague collective habits and tribalistic behaviors; skeletons may band together to tear apart other creatures and free their brethren. Fleshly undead might kill living creatures and harvest their flesh in an attempt to reproduce.",
								"If raised from a freshly killed corpse, a {@creature skeleton} will always start as a {@creature fresh skeleton|LornestFlukesAdvancedUndead}.",
								"A lot of the requirements and fluff for these creatures are due to these miscellaneous natural laws: Memories give a small amount of complicated impetus. Instincts give a large amount of simple impetus. Souls give a bit of both, and act as an animus. Undead use the readily available plane of negative energy as animus instead of a soul, which is why they cannot directly use magic. Certain creatures, like the {@creature white wraith|LornestFlukesAdvancedUndead|} can \"use\" magic, but that is really nothing more than some clever storage and release runes. All creatures must have some form of soul to use magic.",
								"Runes are mentioned as a requirement frequently throughout the contents of this book, but different settings use different rules and systems for runework.

All of these recipies are made with the assumption that they are being made by a single person. If multiple people work together, the time requirement can be cut down at the DMs discretion. When a recipe calls for a weapon, it can be exchanged for a different one, just remember to check proficiencies and change attacks as appropriate. Also, tool proficiency requirements assume that you have the tools on hand. Lastly, when raising an undead creation, for example an {@creature ivory vice|lornestflukesadvancedundead|}, the time spent must be all in one go, {@italic unless} the time requirement is longer than 1 day."

This desire, at first a simple aim towards immortality and power, has grown into a goal far more ambitious.

Necromancy, soul-binding, chronurgy, and more have made him particularly unsavory to any official institutions, and have earned him the hatred of several churches. In particular, he hides from Primus, god of order, and the gods of death and fate.",

His cheeks are thin and bony, and a black mustache drapes itself across his upper lip and down the corners of his mouth. His shoulders are sturdy, and his arms long. He wears a set of dark grey working clothes, simple pants and a heavy overcoat contrasted by shining black studded gloves and a pair of well-worn shoes. When he casts powerful spells, his body can be observed to briefly lose coherency at the edges, as though made of gas.",

						"The Hollow Seraph exists in more than three dimensions. It's body is made up of 7d hyper-toroids, that manifest as shifting rings and spheres to mortal eyes. These rings will actively try and prevent damage to the core, and act as shields. For a creature to bypass all 7 of these shields, they must perfectly time their movements. To pass through a sphere requires a DC15 Acrobatics, Perception, or Arcana check. The Perception or Arcana check may be made by a different creature, as long as they can both clearly see the rings in question(should be at least within 80ft.), and can communicate with the creature trying to pass through. For every ring past the first, the DC of the check increases by 1. For every 30ft. of movement speed it has, a creature may pass through one ring on a single check. Eg, with 90ft. of movement, a creature could pass through three rings with only one check. The DC of the check is as high as the deepest ring a creature is attempting to pass. On a failed check, a creature is ejected from all 7 rings. ",

Slowly but surely, your service will mold this world towards one more receptive to the ideas of cheap immortality and the abolishment of death.
