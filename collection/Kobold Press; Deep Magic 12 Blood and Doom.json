						"Blood and Doom deals with antipaladins and blood magic. Antipaladins, blood mages, and wielders of blood magic in general are intended to appear only as nonplayer characters. That's not because antipaladin or blood mage player characters are unbalanced or no fun. They can be great fun for the person who's playing them, but either of these characters in a group of mostly Good or Neutral PCs can be a real problem for everyone else. Evil characters in general, and antipaladins and blood mages in particular, are more than the sum of a few distasteful class abilities. Both represent an approach to life and society that's utterly amoral, self-centered, and uncompromising\u2014a bad combination where party harmony is concerned.",
						"Before even thinking about making up a character that uses the spells and abilities in this chapter of {@i Deep Magic}, you must clear it not only with your GM but also with the other players.

A field produces no crops until the farmer slices it open with a blade. So, too, will the wrongness in the world refuse to yield until a blade cuts across its face.",

The mouse might well say so, as it's being devoured by the cat. But the mouse is wrong; it's grisly death is both necessary and right.
