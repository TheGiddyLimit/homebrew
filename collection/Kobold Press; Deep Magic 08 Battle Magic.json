						"Any fool can swing a sword. It takes a rare individual to bend the forces of magic to his or her will. Rarer still are those who combine that talent with a study of war. While raining down fire and lightning can decimate an enemy's forces, even more damage can be done to a foe by a well-placed defensive structure, the quick movement of allies, or a curse that impedes the enemy's will to fight. Battle magic is not just about killing your enemy; its true power is in controlling the flow of a conflict so that the spellcaster's allies can seize the moment and win the day."
