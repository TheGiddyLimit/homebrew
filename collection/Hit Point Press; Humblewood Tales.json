As such, these druids can be found providing succor to those affected by natural disasters just as often as to flora and fauna.

				"There is an old tale about a foolish birdfolk sage who believed themselves to be even wiser than the Amaranthine. One day, while wandering alone in the Wood at night, they met Tyton, who had come to collect their soul. Rather than accept their death with dignity, the sage instead debated with {@deity Tyton|Amaranthine|HumblewoodCampaignSetting} about the unfairness of mortality. {@deity Tyton|Amaranthine|HumblewoodCampaignSetting} could not deny their logic, but warned the heedless sage about disrupting the cycle of life and death. He wove a cloak from the fabric of the night sky itself, infused it with a small fraction of his power, and gifted it to the sage. With this, the sage could live forever. {@deity Tyton|Amaranthine|HumblewoodCampaignSetting} declared that he would return in a century, and if the sage still felt the same, the Amaranthine of death would never again visit them. For a hundred years, the sage watched everyone around them gradually age, succumbing to illness and death as they lived on. In the end, the sage understood their folly and asked for {@deity Tyton|Amaranthine|HumblewoodCampaignSetting} to guide them peacefully into the hereafter. It is said that {@deity Tyton|Amaranthine|HumblewoodCampaignSetting} left the Shroud of Ending in the world as a reminder of the sage's foolishness."

Lendarick, a talented mage, was a constant presence among the poorest of folk of Alderheart. He gained the trust of those who trusted the least and helped those who thought they could never be helped. Lendarick had a particular fascination with slimes and their use in potions and metamorphosis. Binding the slimes to his will, Lendarick gifted them with new abilities or transformed them so they could tidy up the Roots of the Great Tree City.",

He wished for all to have beautiful, fungus-free homes filled with light and any food and drink they could imagine. Motivated partly by the guilt of leaving to study at the prestigious Avium, Lendarick poured his efforts into developing biddable and convenient slimes, and the Underfall began to thrive because of his work. Those who used the Roots for crime and held corrupt positions of power started to leave, moving on or reconsidering their crooked trade as it became less profitable. Lendarick believed he was making a better life for those he had left behind in the Underfall.",
								"Unfortunately, in his efforts to help, Lendarick trifled with powers that were too unknown and too strong. In controlling the slimes with dark magic, he changed into something \"not-as-he-was.\" These magics were beyond the Amaranthines and beyond the knowledge of the Avium. Lendarick refused to eat and drink as the magics deepened his obsession with the plight of others. Weakened, the slimes began to overpower Lendarick's body and mind. The slimes he had controlled started to attack innocent folk, consuming them or maiming them with acrid ooze. Crime returned to the Roots, and Lendarick and his slimes disappeared to somewhere dark and forgotten.",
								"No one knows what happened to Lendarick. The rumors in the deepest tunnels of the Roots suggest that, at best, he died, and at worst, he lurks in the dark depths, transformed into something foul, full of slime and vengeance.",

								"This adventure is split into three parts. In {@adventure Part 1: Reya's Watch|HumblewoodTales-HuntForTheLoper|0|Part 1: Reya's Watch}, upon arriving at the hunting perch, the characters discover that Hamlin is notorious for his tall tales.

								"Hamlin is apprehensive when the characters first meet him, as he's been mocked for his sightings before. Once the characters earn his trust, Hamlin tells his story, which details how the Loper is a beautiful but violent creature and a threat to the Wood. With assurances that the party will help him hunt the beast, Hamlin guides the adventurers to the Loper's nest, an enchanted patch of perpetual springtime deep in the Wood.",
								"Finally, in {@adventure Part 3: Into the Loper's Lair|HumblewoodTales-HuntForTheLoper|0|Part 3: Into The Loper's Lair}, the characters see the dreaded Loper. Shortly after finding the lair, the Loper's shadow blots out the sun as it bounds into the clearing, a dead {@creature forest prowler|HumblewoodCampaignSetting} clutched in its teeth. The characters soon learn that the Loper is actually a gentle creature that has been cursed by the sinister Amaranthine, {@deity Kren|Amaranthine|HumblewoodCampaignSetting}. The characters will need to find a way to undo the curse to save both the creature and the Wood."

										"Lightning cuts the rain-drenched sky in twain. For just a split second, the ink-black scenery is lit in dazzling shades of blue and red, and then it is dark again. Yet, in that fleeting moment, The Seahawk can see Saltar's Port beneath him. Ragged and weary, barely able to stay aloft in the raging wind, he descends towards the lighthouse he glimpsed in the lightning's flash.",
										"As he tilts his wings downward, The Seahawk\u2014dressed practically in rags\u2014feels the air tingle with energy. He glances upward and braces himself, squeezing his eyes tight for a moment that stretches into eternity. The lightning's flash is blinding. For a single instant, The Seahawk's body reels in agony, then there is only the sickly aroma of charred feathers as he plummets tothe earth.",
										"Down and down he falls, landing hard in a patch of shrubs outside the lighthouse, whose flame bravely flickers against the gloom. Tiny feet scamper down the stone stairs of the lighthouse before its creaking wooden door slams open. {@creature Arlowene Lum|HumblewoodTales}, a hedge lighthouse keeper, sees the smoldering form of the fallen raptor and gasps in horror before rushing back inside. She returns moments later with bandages, ointment, and a blanket, moving as fast as her stubby legs will carry her. Praying to the Amaranthines as she works, Arlowene applies salves to The Seahawk's still-smoking body. She rolls The Seahawk onto the blanket and, with great effort, hauls him up the stairs and into her home. For the next week, Arlowene stays by the Seahawk's side, save for brief trips into town for food and medicine.",
										"Then, one moonless night, the bells sound to announce the arrival of a ship in the harbor. The ship flies no colors, and its construction is unfamiliar. A group of vulpins emerges from the strange vessel, bearing blackened bows and wearing cloaks that seem to melt into shadow. No sooner than they arrive, they vanish along with their ship, disappearing intothe dark.",
										"Days later, Arlowene pens a desperate letter. She seals it into an envelope, and, praying once more, she sends it. She hopes against hope that it will reach its destination safely. Should no one answer, she fears that two lives will soon be ended: hers and the Seahawk's."

								"This adventure is split into three parts. {@adventure Part 1: Shadows in the Storm|HumblewoodTales-Seahawk|0|Part 1: Shadows in the Storm} sees the characters hunted through the streets by shadowy assassins after accepting a job to protect a wounded raptor. The dark atmosphere and rain-slicked streets of Saltar's Port lend this section a distinctly noir tone. {@adventure Part 2: Enter the Dreamscape|HumblewoodTales-Seahawk|0|Part 2: Enter the Dreamscape} enshrouds the adventurers in a world of dreams and memories, as they must fight through magical nightmares that plague {@creature Arrevis Fleet|HumblewoodTales|The Seahawk's} mind, drawn from his troubled past. This part of the story leans into horror, with themes of psychological torment and grief. Be sure to discuss this with your table before proceeding, and be willing to make accommodations for players who might feel triggered by this content. Using vague descriptions, changing which nightmare monsters appear, and omitting some of the read-aloud text can help tailor this part for different groups. {@adventure Part 3: Awakening|HumblewoodTales-Seahawk|0|Part 3: Awakening} gives the players a chance to question the now conscious Seahawk about the mysteries of his past before they must do battle against his pursuers: a sinister cabal of zealots who worship {@deity Kren|Amaranthine|HumblewoodCampaignSetting}, the Amaranthine of Trickery. This final battle is a challenging affair that will pit the party against a manifestation of {@deity Kren|Amaranthine|HumblewoodCampaignSetting} herself, drawn from the shadows by her supplicants."

								"Two weeks ago, a terrible thunderstorm rolled over Saltar's Port. The wind was powerful enough to rock ships free from their moorings, and the rain was so forceful that it tore the bright orange shingles commonly seen on houses in the port clean from their roofs.",
								"A lone raptor flew in that storm, traveling from a distant and mysterious land. How this seafarer\u2014a raptor named {@creature Arrevis Fleet|HumblewoodTales}\u2014flew so far across the open ocean is a secret known only to him. The raptor's journey ended suddenly when he was struck by lightning in the skies above Saltar's Port and fell to the base of {@adventure Seawatch Tower|HumblewoodTales-Seahawk|0|Seawatch Tower}, an old temple-turned-lighthouse overlooking the sea.",
								"The keeper of the beacon, a middle-aged hedge named {@creature Arlowene Lum|HumblewoodTales}, saved the raptor and tended to his wounds within the steeple-tipped tower. With no name by which to address the stranger, Arlowene called him the Seahawk. By some miracle of {@deity Ardea|Amaranthine|HumblewoodCampaignSetting}, the raptor survived, though he fell into a deep and unshakeable slumber. No more than a week later, an unusual ship flying no colors docked at Saltar's Port, and a group of cloaked and cowled vulpins disembarked. These vulpins are a sect of Kren-worshipers from across the sea; their leaders are shadowy sorcerers known as the {@creature Vulpin Gloomweaver|HumblewoodTales|Gloomweavers}. They have sworn a vendetta against the raptor Arlowene calls the Seahawk and have pursued him to the shores of Humblewood. As soon as they arrived in Saltar's Port, they prowled through the shadows, interrogating locals to locate the raptor.",
								"Although the Gloomweavers had yet to discover Arlowene or the Seahawk after days of searching, Arlowene feared it was only a matter of time before they did, so she hastily sent a message to a trusted friend. In her panic, Arlowene provided few details. All the letter read was, \"Strangers and shadows in Saltar's Port\u2014we're all in danger! The guards won't listen. Send warriors! Come to the {@adventure Rose Hip Tea House|HumblewoodTales-Seahawk|0|The Rose Hip Tea House}, and ask the tea master for Arlowene.\" Arlowene uses {@spell arcane eye} every evening to watch the tea house for the adventurers' arrival.",

										"His name is Arrevis Fleet, and he comes from a small wooded peninsula in the vast lands of Timberfell, which lie across the eastern sea. A group of {@creature Vulpin Priest of Kren|HumblewoodCampaignSetting|Devotees of Kren} ruled this land, and powerful arcanists known as Gloomweavers used their power to enrich themselves at the expense of others. Most of their order were vulpin who believed themselves the rightful inheritors of Kren's power, though a handful of their members were birdfolk and humblefolk who decided that joining the evil order was preferable to suffering under it. Several months ago, Arrevis made such a deal with the Devotees of Kren, joining their occult order. A friend of his, a jerbeen named Chimdry Bress, joined with him. In addition to the security their new position afforded them, the pair were also gifted with powers of illusion and guile befitting servants of Kren.",
										"For a time, Arrevis and Chimdry merely used this power to play pranks upon their neighbors. After months of harmless trickery, they began to test the limits of their power, allowing their little jests to evolve into outright theft and cruelty. With the powers of illusion at their fingertips, it felt natural for the pair to simply take whatever they wanted, and they hardly noticed that they had become no different from the Devotees of Kren they once feared.",
										"At the height of his devotion, Arrevis even built a shrine to Kren in the basement of his cottage and used it to make offerings to the shadowy Amaranthine. Yet, as Arrevis' cruel tricks grew greater and greater, so too did his arrogance. He stopped paying homage to Kren, and though Arrevis' callous greed failed to bother Kren's faithful, his disrespect towards their Amaranthine angered them greatly.",
										"The Devotees of Kren warned Arrevis that his hubris would invoke the Amaranthine's fury, but the raptor ignored their threats. Several weeks later, winter's frost set in, and Arrevis realized he hadn't heard from Chimdry in days. Arrevis traveled out into the woods, where he found Chimdry staggering about, emaciated, almost frozen to death, and digging frantically in the snow. The Devotees of Kren had stolen back the food and supplies Chimdry had taken from the other inhabitants of their region. As the jerbeen had earned nothing honestly that year, he was left to starve in the cold.",
										"Later that day, the Devotees of Kren dispatched a group of loyal Gloomweavers to kill Arrevis for his affront to their Amaranthine. The raptor fled and stole a boat from the harbor in the north and sailed into the trackless ocean in the hope that he could find a safe haven in an unknown land. In the open ocean, Arrevis was overtaken by a terrible storm. His little boat began to take on water. Climbing to the top of the mast as the rain and wind lashed him, Arrevis swore to the {@deity Altus|Amaranthine|HumblewoodCampaignSetting}, the Amaranthine who watches over those who challenge themselves and endure hardships, that if he survived, he would put his cruel ways behind him and work to better the lives of others. He let go of the mast and let the winds of the storm lift him. In a near-impossible feat, Arrevis flew on and on, propelled by the storm until he spotted the safety of Seawatch Tower. Just before he could reach it, Arrevis was struck by lightning.",
										"Arrevis believes that {@deity Altus|Amaranthine|HumblewoodCampaignSetting} heard him and intervened, sweeping him into the storm as a test. He doesn't know if he passed or failed, only that he is determined to face his past and start living honestly, to make up for his misdeeds."

										"The title of Wind-Touched is bestowed on birdfolk who are believed to have been blessed by the wind. They may be marked with unusual feather patterns or have survived a devastating event in their childhood. Typically, the Wind-Touched feel most at home in the high canopy and are graceful and acrobatic, often displaying abilities beyond those of normal birdfolk. Some in Humblewood treat the idea of being Wind-Touched as nothing more than superstition, while others believe they are truly blessed by the wind and see them as sacred figures. Until now, only birdfolk have been considered Wind-Touched. For a jerbeen such as {@creature Tempa Greenkeeper|HumblewoodTales|Tempa} to be Wind-Touched is unheard of. More information on the {@background Wind-Touched|HumblewoodCampaignSetting} background is available under {@book New Backgrounds|HumblewoodCampaignSetting|1|New Backgrounds} in the {@book Humblewood Campaign Setting|HumblewoodCampaignSetting} book, but it is not necessary to run this adventure."

										"I didn't know I was doing it wrong, you see.",
										"When I was in high school, I most definitely was part nerd. A half-nerd. A nerdling, if you will. I loved comics, I loved science fiction, I read Stephen King like his books dripped blood and I was Nosferatu. But like a lot of young people, I just found it easier to keep my loves hidden and secret. I'm sure a lot of you have felt that desire, to protect a little piece of the true joy in your heart when you know full well not everyone will understand. Not everyone will cherish it like you do.",
										"Because that thing you love? Someone doesn't get it.",
										"Soon, I discovered Tolkien. And that made me love fantasy, from the Sword and Sorcery of Robert E. Howard and Ray Harryhausen, to the Shannara and all the other remarkable topography of the imagination. It all seemed so gorgeously {@i limitless}.",
										"I'm from a ridiculously small town in the middle of nowhere, maybe that's why these stories meant so much...grand vistas and tree cities, I wanted to go there. And then I found out you COULD. There was this thing out there, these books and boxed sets and weird dice. ROLE-PLAYING GAMES, sweet mama. And I wanted in.",
										"It blew my mind, I mean, the very {@i idea}. That you could live a story, be part of an adventure, in the Shire, in Cimmeria, even in some incredible landscape yet to be imagined. This part never fails to amuse me, but I got invited to play by the son of my hairdresser. He had a regular game with some friends (I didn't know it was kind of a date, no pressure).",
										"My friends, I loved it. I loved it to pieces. The rulebooks were nothing special, the art was very primitive. None of that mattered, I was hooked. I hung on every word. Remember that feeling? The first RPG you really lost yourself in? Rolling up your first character, drawing little maps of the dungeon so you didn't get lost on the way back? Your first natural 20, your first infuriating 01? Long story short, I ended up marrying the guy later. Lesson to everyone, RPGS promote romance! But it's what happened that night that I still think about. See, I loved the story we played, and I wanted so badly for there to be MORE of it.",
										"So I grabbed paper and markers and pens and did it myself. Part of the adventure was in a little town called Dane. I made a map of how I thought it looked, I made character sheets for the people living there. I made a graph of the dungeon we plundered. I drew sketches of the monsters we fought. Don't act like you don't know this feeling, you sly dog! With no cartography knowledge, I made maps. With no art skills, I drew characters. And with no writing experience, I wrote TALES.",
										"And I loved it. I happily brought all this stuff to the next session, and the DM and his friends were perfectly polite, but also a bit embarrassed. Because I didn't know...there were already books FULL of this stuff.",
										"I didn't know that there were books like the one you are holding in your hands. How could I? I thought you had to make that lore yourself. I know most of you know this feeling, when you open a sourcebook, or a really wonderful campaign book, or a great monster manual...and you just DEVOUR the wonders inside, right?",
										"That's how this book makes me feel every time I open it. It's all of those things. But at a level of craft and love and dedication so far beyond what I could ever have imagined back then. Mind-blowing art, paragraphs that deserve novels to be made from them. It's one of those wonderful, miraculous things that RPGs can do\u2014make a game book that you just want to sit and read until you are completely immersed and dragged under, to the point where you're not sure you ever want to go back. Until you look at the skin on your arm, and see only feathers.",
										"Hit Point Press kindly asked me to write a comic based on the Humblewood campaign setting, with art by the brilliant Sarah Webb. I loved it. After writing six hundred comics, I finally got to write a fantasy. And I've read the materials in the first set a dozen times. I think they topped themselves with this one. The new Tenders lore, the individual 'tales' of the title, my beloved shops and stores, and especially, the stunning Guide To Alderheart. It's a glorious vacation and adventure at once.",
										"I've talked about this setting before. If you've experienced it, you don't need me saying out wonderful it is. But it's everything I didn't have the skills to create after my first RPG and a million times more. That thing you love? It's right here, and they DEFINITELY get it. I love this hobby, and this book is a gateway to the best part of it.",

										"As artists we don't always have the opportunity to let our creativity run free. Projects often require us to adapt to stylistic guidelines that can sometimes limit an artist's creative freedom. It is rare that a commercial project aligns with our personal interests and we sometimes have to accommodate in order to create art for a living.",
										"This wasn't the case with Humblewood.",
										"When art director Leesha Hannigan contacted me at the end of 2018 and asked if I was interested in illustrating a critter-inhabited world named Humblewood, I had no idea what this extensive and lovingly designed setting would develop into one day. Neither did I know how much I would contribute to bringing this world to life.",
										"One illustration turned into dozens and I was given the opportunity to be part of the Humblewood concept art team. For the first time, I had almost no restrictions while working on a project and was not only able to pour all my creativity onto the paper, but also combine it with my two favorite things in the world: animals and nature. As someone who grew up in the German countryside surrounded by lots of wild parks, forests and nature, I've always had animal companions and can't imagine a life without them. Helping shape a world where critters play the leading roles was, and still is, something incredibly special to me.",
										"As an artist, what I find the most fascinating and fun is paying attention to the little things. Of course the broad strokes of a character, like what creature they are, how big or small they are, what colors they wear and so on, are important, but these things can feel empty and bland without the additional small touches that bring them to life. What bag is this character carrying? Is it decorated and if so, with what and how? How dirty or clean is this bag? What's inside? Do we see the things inside peeking out because the carrier likes to collect things, or have they just come home from a market? These are all questions I'm especially taken with as an artist and are essential to making a world appear full, alive and almost touchable for anyone who dives into it.",
										"I'm convinced that the best work happens when we create with true love in our hearts and I think this love is visible in every single page of the Humblewood books. It's a big part of why this world is so successful and loved by readers and players.",
										"In Germany we have a word for this: Herzblut. (Herz = Heart, Blut = Blood ) A poetic way of saying that we create with such passion and fire that our hearts start bleeding in the sense that it overflows with love and excitement.",
										"Over time, Humblewood has grown into a rich world with characters and creatures with history, and places that vibrate with rich colors and liveliness. Being part of Humblewood continues to be an ongoing adventure and I'm beyond excited to see where this journey is going to take me.",
										"Thanks to everyone who is part of Humblewood, be it the creative team or those of you who adventure in Humblewood, you make this world magical!"

								"Humblewood's history and lore are as vast as the great forest itself. As our scholars scrambled to collect the tales of the Wood onto parchment, they discovered that a single volume was not going to be enough to document it all. That is how the tome you hold in your hands, Humblewood Tales, came to be.",
								"While preparing the chapter on the calendar of Everden, our scholars discovered some strange documents from an unfamiliar source. Thus, we are pleased to include a copy of the mysterious Vaultkeeper Randmodius' thoughts on the calendar of Everden, both as a comprehensive guide to timekeeping and as a curiosity.",
								"As a traveler to the Wood, you might find yourself drawn to the Great Tree City of Alderheart\u2014a towering metropolis of bark, branch, and leaf\u2014but navigating your way through the city can be difficult for even the most seasoned explorer. To that end, this tome includes an exclusive printing of {@creature Jonall Hannu|HumblewoodTales|Jonall Hannu's} acclaimed \"Traveler's Guide to Alderheart,\" a comprehensive guidebook to the culture and customs of Humblewood's capital. Learn the history of the Great Tree City, discover the most popular local cuisine, and most importantly, never get lost in Alderheart again!",
								"We've also included a handy guide to some of Humblewood's most famous (and infamous) merchants. You will find new merchandise on which to spend your coin and interesting vendors who might have work for you\u2014perhaps of the adventurous kind!",
								"Have you ever been curious about the Tenders of the Scorched Grove? Perhaps you have wondered what the Tenders are like elsewhere in Everden? You'll find many details here about the ranks and rituals of this mysterious organization. The Tenders channel the Great Rhythm in many extraordinary ways, and you can learn from them here as well: Train as a Circle of the Warden druid and protect the denizens of the Wood, gain arcane insight from nature with the wizarding tradition of Leyline Magic, or travel down a darker path with the Predator warlock patron.",
								"Finally, we have collected the Humblewood Tales themselves, stories of daring adventure from across the Wood. Help fight corrupted slime in the Roots of Alderheart, hunt down the legendary Loper, uncover the mysteries surrounding a young jerbeen who may be Wind-Touched, or venture to Saltar's Port to tangle with a wakewyrm or into the tragic memories of the enigmatic Seahawk. These tales are for you to make your own.",
								"There is more to be seen of the Humblewood than can ever be collected\u2014it is a task that will continue for a long time to come. Our hope is that with this tome in hand, you will be able to continue your exploration of Everden and create even more Humblewood Tales of your own.",

												"Over my long life, I have peered into countless worlds with grand civilizations where powerful magics and altered physical laws hold sway.

I must admit, I was greatly amused by the oddly charming method the inhabitants of this place devised to chart the passage of time. It seems that the first record keepers of Everden's history were bards of some sort: these musicians began incorporating the noteworthy events of a solar revolution into a song that could be passed down through generations. As these minstrels traveled and shared their story-songs, their role evolved from the purely musical to the more consciously historical. They became known as \"songkeepers,\" though few who hold this office in Everden's present still practice music. In honor of these origins, time and history in Everden arestill recorded in musical terms, whether sung or not. Adorable.",

The great Evertree of Alderheart is tall enough to be visible on the horizon as soon as you cross the Horned Ridge, the mountains that divide Firnveldt from Humblewood. From the East, as you leave the towering mountains, you'll find the land quickly slopes into a gentle valley. From there, if you follow the main road that winds between the great charred plains of the Scorched Grove and the marshes of the Mokk Fields, you'll be on your way to Alderheart. Coming from the Songsea, you'll likely land at Saltar's Port. Follow the road north, and you'll soon reach Alderheart.",
								"Regardless of the direction of your approach to Alderheart, you'll need to travel through Humblewood's vast forest that locals call simply \"the Wood.\" While few rivers run through the forest, community wells supply more than enough fresh water from deep underground to support the many small communities that thrive here. What shallow streams there are, flow south to the sea.",
								"Every time I come to Humblewood, I always respect how uneven the land around Alderheart is compared to the flat plains of my homeland. It rises into hills or suddenly descends into crags and caves. Thankfully, the trade roads through the forest are well-traveled and mostly flat. Otherwise, my gargath traveling companion, Bello, would have a tough time.",

Given how imposing the great tree is, I like to imagine that the seed must have rivaled Bello in size!",

										"Some have claimed that the tree has specially chosen them to make its will known by sending them visions or sharing dream-like scenes of things it has witnessed throughout its long life. Many earnestly trust those who claim to be blessed with the Evertree's revelations. However, while genuine cases have been documented, several claimants have been exposed as charlatans. Be wary of someone who asserts that they've been chosen by the Evertree, especially if they're trying to sell you something."

										"The first inhabitants of the tree now known as Alderheart were birdfolk. Nowadays, the different kinds of birdfolk of Humblewood see themselves as kith and kin, but in the distant past, they were distinct, self-governing peoples. The five birdfolk clans\u2014the {@race corvum|HumblewoodCampaignSetting|corvums}, the {@race gallus|HumblewoodCampaignSetting}, the {@race luma|HumblewoodCampaignSetting|lumas}, the {@race raptor|HumblewoodCampaignSetting|raptors}, and the {@race strig|HumblewoodCampaignSetting|strigs}\u2014lived apart. Birdfolk from different clans were just as likely to be enemies as friends, and each had their own ways and customs the others didn't care to understand.",
										"By the oldest evidence, Birdfolk began living in Alderheart as early as Song 198. The first to inhabit the Evertree were a band of outcasts from various birdfolk clans. Many were druids who led their companions to commune with the spirit of the Great Tree. They were the first to learn the tree's name, Alderheart. After hearing of their wish to coexist without the separation imposed by the clans, the Evertree invited this mixed group of birdfolk to live in its branches.",
										"The mighty Evertree taught the druids tree-shaping magic that allowed them to create homes and other structures within its trunk and branches and later within other trees, as long as the shaping was carried out with a tree's consent. Using this magic, the druids shaped stairways from the forest floor all the way to the very top of Alderheart. A temple to the birdfolk Amaranthines was fashioned within the Evertree, which would later become known as Holybranch. Around it, the first homes were shaped in the high branches of the Canopy.",
										"Over time, this small settlement grew into a haven for birdfolk who wished to escape the clans' endless feuding. The compassionate folk of the treetop turned away no peaceful soul. Alderheart became known as a neutral territory within the Wood: a place where all were welcome to live a life of harmony and pay homage to the spirits of nature.",
										"It wasn't just the birdfolk who found a home in the early days of Alderheart. Those who weren't birdfolk, the varied people commonly referred to as \"humblefolk\" in the Wood, lived in a village amidst the undergrowth near the northwest side of the tree. This settlement, Bramblewell, was established among the Evertree's exposed roots shortly after birdfolk started residing in the treetop. Bramblewell is a ruin now, but the surviving records estimate that it was founded around Song 208. By all accounts, Alderheart was more than big enough to support both settlements, and the two communities coexisted peacefully for decades.",
										"By Song 353, the birdfolk had finished shaping the great treetop temple to the Amaranthines they named Holybranch. Pilgrims visiting Holybranch would pass through Bramblewell with coin to spend and wares to trade. Thanks to the travelers, Bramblewell thrived. The treetop community also blossomed, becoming a monastic center. Skilled healers and those in tune with the spirits of nature flocked to it. The Canopy was considered a sacred place, close to the Great Rhythm. Though eager to accept temple acolytes and visiting pilgrims, it grew more slowly than Bramblewell below. While neither community grew wealthy, they both prospered and knew little hardship. However, this time of peace didn't last."

										"The Wood was an unruly place in those early days, and the settlements beyond Alderheart looked out only for themselves. The various bandits, robbers, and crooks of Humblewood used this to their advantage. In Song 402, they joined together to form a great pack of thieves known as the Bandit Coalition under a mysterious figure known only as The Robber King. To this day, the Bandit Coalition's name and insignia are used by brigands to spark fear in the hearts of honest folk.",
										"The Coalition raided every corner of the land. Even the birdfolk in their lofty perches weren't safe. The bandits came prepared. With ropes, ladders, and cunning tactics, the settlements of the Wood were ransacked one by one. Only the Evertree was left unscathed. Its trunk was too tall to scale, its stairways too narrow to storm, and its bark too thick to burn.",
										"Vulnerably located on the forest floor, Bramblewell was attacked by the Coalition. However, thanks to the warnings from the acolytes watching high above for approaching marauders, the folk of Bramblewell were able to take shelter high in the Evertree while the Bandit Coalition sacked their little town. With the assistance of their neighbors from the Canopy, each time Bramblewell was raided, its people rebuilt it stronger than before. Bramblewell raised stone walls and other fortifications, ruined traces of which can still be seen. Townsfolk with combat skills organized themselves into a trained militia, becoming a bulwark against the bandit raids.",
										"In exchange for the kindness shown to them by the folk of the Canopy, Bramblewell ensured that the treetop community continued to receive supplies and kept watch for anyone who might try to sneak up through the tree's hidden stairways. By supporting each other, both communities were strong enough to resist the worst of the Bandit Coalition's onslaught together.",
										"As Bramblewell grew, it opened its gates to the wounded and frightened folk from nearby villages. It wasn't long before the Great Tree of Alderheart was established as a symbol of hope for the denizens of Humblewood. Birdfolk from the divided clans began to look to Alderheart as a place of safety and security, paving the way for the city's founding."

										"As the Bandit crisis in the Wood continued on song after song and more folk fled to Alderheart, it became clear that the small community had to grow and change. In Song 411, as the Bandit Coalition swept across the Wood in their fiercest attacks yet, the birdfolk and humblefolk sent representatives to Bramblewell to attend the Conference of Glimmercall. There they discussed how to organize themselves to stand against the bandit assault. Those who gathered there would drastically change the course of history in the Wood.",
										"After days of heated debate, Edwin Ebonheart, a wizard who had long studied the magic of the Evertree, received a vision from the Great Tree itself. Alderheart expressed its wish to shelter the people of the Wood from the Bandit Coalition. Carrying the Evertree's message, Edwin suggested building a safe haven for those fleeing the Bandit Coalition: a true city in the branches and trunk of Alderheart, far greater than the small enclave that already existed. While all saw the wisdom in this plan, disagreement over who would lead this new city ensued. Fennel Jeramis, mayor of Bramblewell, expressed concerns over losing autonomy if her town was merged with the new city above. In the face of this reluctance, it was put forward that a city founded by members from each birdfolk clan would serve as a unifying force but that there would be resistance from the birdfolk clans should this be expanded to include humblefolk. Eventually, without an enthusiastic consensus, matters were resolved: the birdfolk would form a council to oversee the new treetop city and ensure equity between the birdfolk clans.",
										"Meanwhile, the humblefolk would retain full control of Bramblewell below but would not have a say in the ruling of the city above.",
										"Ava Windsweft heartily agreed to this plan, seeing the potential to rally the feuding birdfolk clans behind a common cause and end the feuds that had troubled the birdfolk for generations. The last to agree was Mayor Jeramis, agreeing to support the new city because it could bring more prosperity to her humblefolk-governed town of Bramblewell. Additionally, the newly-formed city would be sworn to help and protect Bramblewell. However, this promise would be broken only a few decades later in the eyes of Bramblwell's last residents as Alderheart stood idly by while its neighbor collapsed into disrepair. With the final terms agreed to, construction on the treetop city of Alderheart began on the 30th day of the Glimmercall chorus, Song 411."

With the military-minded Grido Snowtarn's guidance, Hevod designed the city's fortified entry points to prevent infiltration by smugglers and bandit scouts.

The city's first phase was built quickly, so very little tree shaping could be used. This architectural legacy can be seen today in both new and old homes belonging to the wealthy in the Canopy. Alderheart's elites continue to favor a classic architectural style that uses materials from across Humblewood and does not incorporate shaping.",
										"This foundational style emerged from Edwin's collaborations with Geswick Switch, whom he would later fall for, and relied heavily on the mapach inventor's efficient system of lifts and pulleys. The dynamic pair established walkways and stabilizing platforms to keep structures built closer to the edge of branches accessible and make them resilient against storms. Edwin, who possessed an interest in astronomy, also commissioned the first great observatory in the Canopy.",
										"As the fledgling city was being constructed, Ferro Keer trained anyone who volunteered in the ways of agile branch-to-branch combat and archery. The armed company she founded would become the backbone of Humblewood's defenses, the force now known as the Perch Guard. While many birdfolk excelled in techniques of branch skirmishing and dive attacks, these fighting styles relied on gliding and weren't suited to the humblefolk of Bramblewell. Instead, Ferro focused on training the humblefolk to use ranged weapons. Though the Perch Guard of today is associated with the agile, spear-wielding techniques of its birdfolk contingent, the first Perch Guard was equally composed of humblefolk archers and birdfolk skirmishers."

										"By Song 412, the foundations of the city of Alderheart were complete, though it would scarcely be recognizable today. The early city was primarily constructed on the south side of the Evertree. If you wander that district, you will find some of Alderheart's oldest buildings. However, the early city wasn't much more than a fortified settlement built up around the Holybranch temple. The developing city flourished, drawing many people from across the Wood as the word spread that Alderheat was founded on the ideals of safety and cooperation.",
										"However, The Robber King also heard the rumors of the city built to resist them and made plans to crush the young city to maintain the Coalition's stranglehold on the Wood. Fortunately, Alderheart caught wind of the plan and had time to prepare while the bandits organized their scattered forces. This conflict came to a head in Song 413 at The Battle of Alderheart.",
										"At the start of summer, the Bandit Coalition launched a ferocious attack against the Great Tree City. Armed with flaming catapults and great ballistae, the Coalition's goal was to topple the Evertree and with it the fragile hope that anyone in the Wood could resist their might. In the face of the assault, Alderheart's founders led the Perch Guard in defense of the city. The battle lasted ten days, filled with bitter fighting and great losses on both sides. The steadfast leadership of the founders and the discipline of Alderheart and Bramblewell's combined forces won out, finally routing the bandits. The Robber King is believed to have died in this battle. No records referring to the Coalition's leader exist after this point, though many others using the title have popped up throughout history, claiming to be descendants of the original Robber King. This defeat hobbled the Coalition's forces and led to the end of their threat to the Wood.",
										"Today, outside the Council Plaza Courthouse, a wooden obelisk shaped from the Evertree bears the names of those who gave their lives in the Battle of Alderheart. The names are filled in with gold so that they will never fade. Vines of goldblossoms grow around the memorial and bloom every song in Rayswell, marking Alderheart's victory and honoring the memory of those who fell in combat."

										"With the Bandit Coalition shattered, the Wood entered a new age of peace. In Song 415, Alderheart established its governing body, the Birdfolk Council. Many in the city wished the founders to form the Council, but they all refused, save for Ava Windsweft. The others felt their talents could be put to better use elsewhere. Therefore, with a mission to foster a sense of unity among the five birdfolk clans and govern over Alderheart, the first Birdfolk Council was established by Ava, along with representatives from the other four clans. Given Ava's diplomatic and fair nature, the Council unanimously voted for her to lead it as the first Speaker.",
										"The Council's first act was to sign the Humblefolk Treaty with leaders from towns and villages across the Wood, effectively placing all of Humblewood under the protection of the newly established Perch Guard. An age of chaos that had reigned for nearly fifteen songs finally came to an end.",
										"After its momentous victory over the Bandit Coalition, the city attracted migrants and merchants from all over the Wood, looking to rebuild their lives. Soon, the great markets in the Canopy and Trunk were constructed, new residents set up homes on the new branchroads, and tunnels were excavated throughout the Trunk.",
										"Word of a better life to be had in the Great Tree City above trickled down to the roots of the Evertree. The call of fortune in the city above outsung any loyalty many had to Bramblewell below. Bramblewell was able to sustain itself for some time but began to fall into disrepair as its folk moved up into Alderheart, seeking opportunity and prosperity. This issue was brought to the attention of the Bird Folk Council many times by the leaders of Bramblewell, but Alderheart, preoccupied with its own affairs, neglected the failing town. By Song 448, Bramblewell had been abandoned completely. Now only overgrown ruins remain of the once proud community, but its legacy lives on in the humblefolk who reside in Alderheart to this day."

										"The next great expansion of the city came in the aftermath of what is called The Great Calamity. During the summer of Song 486, a forest fire of unprecedented proportions raged through the Wood. This event is forever remembered by the folk of the Wood as the Great Calamity. Nobody knows exactly how the fire was first lit nor finally extinguished, but the blaze reduced the entire western section of the forest to cinders, leaving behind a flame-cursed plain of ash known as the Scorched Grove. In all my travels, I've never seen anything quite like it. It mars the Wood like a scar: an eerie place of searing winds, smoldering soil, and strange monsters. I'd give the Scorched Grove a wide berth, dear traveler, as it is filled with dangers.",
										"In the aftermath of the Great Calamity, many who lived in the area that became the Scorched Grove, mostly humblefolk, had lost loved ones, homes, and livelihoods to the inferno. They looked to Alderheart for aid. The Birdfolk Council responded by decreeing that new spaces and branchroads be shaped in the lower Trunk to make homes for the influx of new residents. Since the Calamity, humblefolk have outnumbered birdfolk in Alderheart but still did not gain representation on the Council. At the time, the Birdfolk Council chose to view the refugees as guests rather than true citizens of Alderheart. The shortfall of not including humblefolk representation on the Council is still a dark mark on the city's history. It prevented humblefolk from sharing valuable perspectives on how the city could benefit all its residents.",
										"As the Trunk filled, the city began turning folk away, claiming that there were not enough resources to sustain all the refugees. Those desperately seeking a home began to dig into Alderheart's roots secretly. Though crude at first, a network of tunnels formed over time, and small communities developed within them. For these root-dwellers, life was hard, and some resorted to thievery and smuggling to survive. The communities in the roots were an open secret for generations. The Council only publicly acknowledged the existence of the secret tunnels in Song 721 and promptly sent tree-shapers to fill in the tunnels. However, Alderheart refused the tree-shapers. The Evertree wished to provide shelter to those who needed it, and the mighty Alderheart bid the tree-shapers strengthen the tunnels, shape proper homes for the Root-dwellers, and connect them to the rest of the city instead.",
										"In Song 723, after a change in leadership, the Council agreed to expand the once clandestine tunnels, and the area became formally known as the Roots, the last official level of the city. Today, the Roots continue to be stigmatized by narrow-minded folk as a place of crime and villainy. Life in the Roots is still tough compared to the other levels of Alderheart, but for those who live there, it is their home, and they are proud of it."

The gate can handle both freight and foot traffic, but it mainly sees use by folks who travel light. Anyone laden with too much cargo is directed south toward the Bastion Gate.

Its pleasing appearance and ease of use have earned it the nickname \"The Friendly Gate.\" Though it mainly handles foot traffic, the Welcomeway Gate boasts innovative hand crank-operated lifts.

These are the halls of the Inventors' Guild and the Smiths' Guild, and both are hives of activity day and night. An ingenious assortment of chimney pipes branches upwards in a tangle from the atrium's guildhalls and small stalls. These chimney pipes harmlessly snake through the living wood of the tree, directing potentially harmful vapors from manufacturing up and out of the Trunk. This system was conceived by the Inventors' Guild and has made it possible to manufacture safely within Alderheart without harming citizens or the Evertree. The pipes are warm to the touch.

Though it resembles grass, threadgrass is actually the visible part of a huge fungus that extends far outside the tree. Colonies of this fungus help aerate the earth surrounding the Evertree's roots, allowing the mighty tree to take in more nourishment from the soil. In Song 723, Avium alchemists discovered that threadgrass could be used as a potent reagent in healing tinctures, alleviating everything from stomach pain to headaches. The tough threadgrass must be pounded in a pestle and mortar before it can be used in this way, giving Pestlehaven its name.",

While the Council was originally intended to oversee only the city, small villages harassed by the remnants of the First Bandit Coalition and threatened by dangerous beasts called upon the Council for aid. To coordinate the Perch Guard's deployment throughout the Humblewood region, the area the Council was responsible for was expanded. The rise of the Council wiped out what remained of the clans' influences. In time, the Council came to govern the whole of the Wood. With this change and the growing irrelevance of the birdfolk clans, the Council structure shifted to represent major settlements in the Wood rather than each type of birdfolk.",

The Council's Speaker wields veto power that they are expected to use rarely and wisely. Speakers serve for as long as they continue to represent their perch, so those nominated are heavily scrutinized and must meet a very high standard.",

Anyone in Humblewood can request an audience with the Council to suggest a change to a law, report on problems, or seek resolution of legal disputes. However, the wait to see the Council can be long as Council members are often busy with the day-to-day tasks of governance. Two hours are set aside each day when at least one Council member will be available to see petitioners. Urgent and major disputes are scheduled before the full Council, and outcomes are decided upon based on evidence and witness testimony.

Though the Merchants' Guild may be the wealthiest in the city, the Smiths' Guild is not far behind. They often proudly boast that their goldsmiths mint Alderheart's coins using ingots smelted by guild members. The head of the Smiths' Guild is named Dunston Plovergold. This grandfatherly {@race gallus|HumblewoodCampaignSetting} is the longest-serving Guild leader in Alderheart, and he has been a driving force in various collaborations."

The order existed long before the city of Aldeheart was founded. Some of the first birdfolk who came to commune with the spirit of the Evertree were Tenders. Nowadays, folks in Alderheart see the Tenders in one of two ways: as useful druids who keep the city in balance with the Great Rhythm or as a collection of odd folk who ought to spend more time in the treetops than with their feet in the dirt. Regardless of what you may think of them, the Tenders have a strong presence in the city, and the doors of their headquarters in the Trunk Market are always open should you wish to hear what they have to say.",
										"You can find groves across the Trunk level where Tenders cultivate medicinal plants and fungi that grow naturally within the Evertree. The Tenders are knowledgeable herbalists, and folks regularly purchase their potions, tinctures, and salves. These cures are the Tenders' main source of income. Nevertheless, should you ever find yourself in dire need of healing, no Tender worth their robes will turn you away. The Tenders are also scholars and teachers, and they're always willing to help folks learn about the art of healing or natural magic. Shaped buildings within their groves house archives of knowledge accumulated over the generations, though you'll need to speak with a Tender for access, as some of these texts are reserved for experienced members of their order.",

There are only about a hundred of these casks in existence, each attached to the living Evertree. They are rumored to be kept in a special chamber called the Caskhold somewhere in Alderheart. This secret location is guarded under the watch of both {@book the Gourmand's Guild|HumblewoodTales|1|The Gourmands' Guild} and {@book the Shaper's Guild|HumblewoodTales|1|The Shapers' Guild}. Only vintners granted special privileges can have their wines aged in these casks. Everwines mature under the care of guild members sworn to secrecy to prevent thievery of the casks or the everwine itself. Bottles of genuine everwine are sealed with wax and marked with the Gourmand Guild's seal to foil imitators. Despite these precautions, remain wary of forgeries. If you're paying less than 25 gold acorns (gp) a bottle, it's probably too good to be true."

Up in the prestigious Canopy district, magical and mundane fires are used to keep homes warm, while in the Roots and Trunk districts, most homes are well insulated by the Evertree's thick bark or the ground. While the city is at its quietest, daring young Alderites go sledding on the frozen branchroads. The celebration of Glowingtide is held during this season, and throughout the holiday, the Evertree is lit by all sorts of lights, both for warmth and to help keep folks in good cheer through the coldest nights of the year.",
												"Finally, the cold begins to abate during the chorus of Deepstill, which fills Alderites with anticipation for the new spring and helps to lighten the mood in the last days of winter. By the end of the chorus, the ice covering the branchroads starts to thaw, and folks in the city begin preparing for spring and the new song to come.",

						"The Tales From The Wood are a series of short, self-contained adventures which can be completed over one or multiple sessions, depending on your players and GM style. Each adventure can be enjoyed on its own as a one-shot introduction to Humblewood or added to an existing Humblewood game. Should you desire, you can change the locations or story elements present in an adventure to suit the pace and tone of your game. You can even break these adventures up and use them as pieces to build your own custom campaign.",
						"This section contains the following five adventures, organized by their suggested character level:",
						"{@adventure The Wind-Touched|HumblewoodTales-WindTouched} was written by Dominik Parisien and tells the story of a curious occurrence in the normally quiet town of Marshview, where a local {@race jerbeen|HumblewoodCampaignSetting} is rumored to have gained the power of flight. At the same time, a great monstrosity has begun to terrorize the trade roads around the city. Could the two be related? This charming adventure is perfect for a party of 3rd-level characters.",
						"{@adventure The Wakewyrm's Fury|HumblewoodTales-WakewyrmsFury} was Hit Point Press' contribution to 2020's Free RPG Day. It features an exciting trek through an enormous sea cave near Saltar's Port, where pirate poachers have hidden themselves away from the local authorities. Tricks, traps, and a fearsome beast await! Woe betides those who earn the wakewyrm's fury. This daring expedition is well suited to a party of 5th-level characters.",
						"{@adventure The Seahawk|HumblewoodTales-Seahawk} was penned by James Haeck and centers around a mysterious series of events in Saltar's Port. It all begins when a thunderstorm knocks a traveling {@race raptor|HumblewoodCampaignSetting} from the sky, and a mysterious ship docks at the harbor. Who are the shadowy strangers which emerged from that boat, and what do they want with the Seahawk? This noir mystery is full of thrills and chills for a party of 5th-level characters.",
						"{@adventure Hunt For the Loper|HumblewoodTales-HuntForTheLoper} is a tale by Jordan Richer and begins as an errand to the quaint hunting outpost of Reya's Watch. The party follows rumors of a fantastical beast known only as \"The Loper,\" which is said to have been sighted in the forest. Little do they know that what stalks the woods is far stranger than anything they could imagine! This wild adventure was crafted for a party of characters between 4th and 6th-level.",
						"Finally, {@adventure Descent into the Dark|HumblewoodTales-DescentIntoTheDark}, a story by Holly Conrad, plunges the players right into the action as they witness a slime attack in the Great Tree City of Alderheart. Following the trail leads the party all the way down to the city's roots, where a strange infestation of slimes has taken hold and must be dealt with before they endanger the city. This epic quest was designed for a party of 7th-level characters.",

The Crimson Rose regularly welcomes customers from the nearby port and from villages all along the Talongrip Coast.",
								"The store's owner, \"The Captain,\" is a briny old salt with a warm heart beneath her stern demeanor. She was once a captain in the Saltar's Port Coast Guard before her retirement, after which she had her ship dismantled and rebuilt as a seaside shop. Petra settled into the life of a merchant but has never quite left her seafaring ways behind her. A few of her crew members followed her after being honorably discharged. Since then, she has added to her \"crew,\" offering work to those who have impressed her with their words and deeds. The Crimson Rose has grown into a prosperous business, thanks to both The Captain's guidance and the dedication of her crew.",

One of her more distinguishing features is her left arm, which is missing wing feathers. This injury was caused by the bolt of a heavy ballista, which struck her during a heated battle against pirates. Petra survived, but her injury never healed properly, and she permanently lost the ability to glide. Eventually, Petra's age caught up with her, and she chose to retire honorably rather than risk the safety of the ships under her protection. As a reward for her years of loyal service, she was allowed to keep her ship, The Crimson Rose. As the ship was also showing its age, Petra decided to run it aground and use its remains to build the quiet seaside shop she had always dreamed of owning.",

Thankfully, her former career protecting merchant fleets means she knows many seafaring traders grateful for her service and captains who are happy to provide her with preferential prices on their extraordinary stock.",

Her unvarnished opinions can rub some folks the wrong way, but the strength of her convictions is inspirational, and she always seems to have the right words to rouse the spirits of others. She usually takes a hands-on approach to managing her staff. When not issuing orders, she can be found upstairs in her quarters, where she deals with the paperwork that accompanies managing a store that works closely with seafaring merchant companies."

His position as an enforcer left him with few friends in the Coalition, save for a jerbeen named Durban Softpad. Durban had also grown up in the Roots, in a district known as Pestlehaven, and the two became fast friends, bonding over their experiences. When Liann, a free-spirited jerbeen swashbuckler, joined their gang, Cathus watched as his best friend fell in love. It wasn't long before Cathus was attending Durban and Liann's wedding, and the couple somehow managed to make a life for themselves and have a child while on the road with the Coalition. Throughout all of it, Cathus remained close to the couple. Cathus often visited Liann to deal with chores and help her care for her newborn son, Finnan, whenever Durban was occupied with banditry. Despite the cruelty Cathus witnessed and even wrought upon others in his time as an enforcer, the love and care he saw in Liann and Durban's small family filled him with hope.",
										"One day, while delivering a message on orders from her captain, Liann was captured by the Perch Guard. From loosemuzzled bandits, Cathus discovered that Liann had been set up by the Coalition. The Coalition's spies had learned the Perch Guard had been preparing a trap to capture Liann's unit captain, and Liann had been sent into the ambush instead to take the fall. Cathus reluctantly kept the information to himself, lest Durban do something reckless, but it cost the mapach what little faith he had left in the Coalition.",
										"Not long after, as their unit started to dwindle due to arrests or worse fates, Cathus and Durban were sent out together on raids. A few months later, they were found by the Perch Guard alone, robbing a cart. Durban allowed himself to be captured so that Cathus could escape, but not before making Cathus vow to take care of Finnan. Durban's last words to Cathus were: \"Don't let him turn out like us.\" Upon his return, Cathus attempted to leave the Coalition, assuming that his years of loyal service would allow him to retire quietly. Instead, he was told by his captain, a cruel hedge known as {@creature Aster the Thorn|HumblewoodTales} [he/him], that he would begin fencing stolen property for the Coalition somewhere discreet. Cathus begrudgingly accepted on the condition that {@creature Aster the Thorn|HumblewoodTales|Aster} promised to leave Finnan out of their business. {@creature Aster the Thorn|HumblewoodTales|Aster} agreed, knowing he could use Finnan to keep Cathus in line.",

As far as Cathus knows, Finnan has no living relatives besides his parents, who won't be released from Alderheart's prison until Finnan is grown. Cathus hopes he can provide a better life for the boy, but he feels great guilt about his situation.

Zifa has worked her way up from nothing, and she flaunts her refined manners and excellent sense of style as a way of distancing herself as much as possible from her former life. She is keenly aware of the debt she owes to the Windswefts. Both her sense of personal pride and her desire to please her benefactors have led to her working tirelessly to improve Zephyr & Co. Zifa is also well paid for her efforts, and she wishes to save as much coin as possible to ensure she and her mother need never worry about returning to a life of poverty. Her financial success has even allowed her to support her aging mother with a comfortable home in the Canopy. Zifa has run the store for five years now and has accrued a great deal of experience and a keen sense for business.",

Living in poverty taught her that not everyone in the world can succeed, so she cut ties with everyone in her old life except for her mother, believing that they would only hold her back. As someone who built herself up from nothing, she has no patience for people who don't meet the high standards she sets for herself and her clientele. Zifa makes people who appear unable to afford her wares feel unwelcome in the store, and she insists they only return once they have made something of themselves. Although she takes pride in how far she's come, she keeps her past as a Trunk urchin under wraps for fear of how it would reflect on both her business and her employers.

She eventually turned to thievery out of desperation and was caught by a hedge street musician named {@creature Moonflower|HumblewoodTales|Moonflower Mosswell} [she/her]. Instead of turning Zifa in, Moonflower hired her. She found that Zifa had an incredible voice, and she began to train the young luma to perform alongside her.

The Windswefts were enchanted by the young girl and were so moved by her plight that they offered Zifa and her mother jobs as servants in their manor. The pair worked for the Windswefts for years, and Zifa was educated in manners, etiquette, and proper ways to behave around the upper class. She was precocious and learned much from the nobles while serving at galas and banquets held by the family.",

She had a talent for numbers and organization, which led to Zifa taking over management of the other servants, as well as many housekeeping responsibilities, including making necessary purchases for the estate. Recognizing her talent, the Windswefts asked her to assist in the stockroom at Zephyr & Co., one of the family's stores that was struggling at the time. Zifa found that her work for the store was more fulfilling than working as a servant, but she felt guilty for wanting to leave her position at Windsweft manor. The Windswefts noticed, and rather than waste her talents, they encouraged Zifa to pursue full-time employment at the store.",
										"In a short time, thanks to her hard work and skill, Zifa earned a promotion to store manager, where her insights helped the struggling store blossom into what it is today. Zifa is forever grateful to the Windswefts. She cares deeply for her work and has made it her personal mission to make the store as successful as possible."

						"Hundreds of songs ago, in the already ancient forest of Humblewood, a wise birdfolk sage befriended the treants who stewarded the groves of the Wood. The treants taught the sage about the forest, the creatures they shared it with, and how all are cradled within the Great Rhythm's embrace. The sage used their teachings to found the Tenders, an order sworn to uphold the balance of natural forces. Although the sage's name has been lost to history, the Tenders persist to this day.",
						"As humble caretakers of the Wood, the first Tenders studied the interconnectedness of all life and the practice of gentle, natural magic. The treants' teachings helped the Tenders heal the forest from blights and fires. Tenders protected small woodland villages and used their magic to provide support in times of hardship. Possessing a deep insight into the Great Rhythm, the Tenders came to be seen as a bridge between the will of the Wood and the people who lived there and soon became an established presence in the Wood.",
						"The order faced its greatest challenge during the Great Calamity. As fires raged unabated, incinerating nearly a third of Humblewood's woodland, the Tenders helped those fleeing the blaze. The flames left their scar upon the forest, an area called the Scorched Grove, and the Tenders took it upon themselves to restore the corrupted earth. Their search to correct the elemental imbalance of the Scorched Grove led the Tenders to incorporate disparate schools of magic into their teachings. Most notably, they merged the scholarly approach of Avium wizards with the harmonious teachings of their druidic arts. With this new understanding of {@skill arcana}, the Tenders have made steady progress toward healing the Grove's corruption.",
						"As certain Tenders dedicated their lives to healing the Scorched Grove, others pledged to mend the world in different ways. Some organized into a force of field medics to aid during natural upheavals, while others became healers, teachers, and tree-shapers. Tenders traveled across Everden, where they discovered lands suffering dangerous elemental imbalances. To meet these challenges, the formerly loose association of Tenders divided themselves into distinct chapters called Branches. Each Branch of the Tenders has an elected leader called a treekeeper. Once every fifty songs, treekeepers convene to share what each Branch has learned. Treekeepers also hold urgent meetings when necessary but are otherwise absorbed in their own tasks.",

This duty extends to safeguarding hazardous magics and powerful artifacts lest they fall into the wrong hands. When nature summons up storms, floods, or other life-threatening events, the Tenders work to lessen their harm, providing help for those injured or displaced and repairing the damage wrought to the natural world. Finally, the Tenders have a duty to tend to areas that have been scarred or corrupted by strong elemental energies.

Members of this Branch regularly make pilgrimages to the Scorched Grove to learn from the elders there. Some put down roots in the Grove and dedicate their lives to keeping watch over the area.

Skilled in the primordial magic of the very first druids, the eldest of their kind used their awesome power to form a barrier against the inferno. Their leaves burned to ash, their bodies charred and splintered. Through it all, the treants stood tall and firm, sheltering the Wood until a ritual abated the Calamity...though who knows for how long.",
														"I suspect that, to whoever reads this, it may be hard to believe that treants were once a common sight in the Wood. Indeed, they could often be seen strolling through the hillsides. Each treant had its own grove and tended to all things living within it. The old stories say we took our name from the treants, for we too aspired to be Tenders of the forest. Being long-lived, the treants knew much of the Wood's history, and, though they were towering creatures, not even the smallest seed escaped their notice. Above all else, they were teachers, and that is what we Tenders must strive to be. With the eldest and wisest of the treants lost to the flames, we must take their place, not only as keepers of lore and stewards of nature, but as those who tend to the very spirit of this world."

You are responsible for directing the efforts of lower-ranking members of the order based on information shared with you by the autumnals. You lead a team of {@dice 2d6} {@creature Acolyte||acolytes} and {@dice 2d4} {@creature Druid||druids} of sapling rank or lower. You have the authority to task these NPCs with specific missions, though any mission you assign must be of relevance to the goals of the order. You may call upon {@dice 1d4} {@creature Acolyte||acolytes} and a {@creature druid} from among these to assist you directly with a task for the order. In these situations, you are responsible for their safety, and you may be held accountable should anything go wrong."

Your responsibility is not only to issue general instructions to your Branch's circle of autumnals but also to obtain information that can be shared with them to help uphold the natural balance in the region your Branch is sworn to tend. Some Branches, such as the Tenders of the Scorched Grove, use this information to manage or heal threats to the natural balance, while other Branches must instead keep a vigilant watch for signs of impending danger.",

Instead, they work to further the goals of their Branch through their own actions. Some spend their time in contemplation and study, communing with nature, as well as doing research and experimentation. Others journey to uncover lost knowledge, which may help predict threats or find solutions to heal areas scarred by elemental imbalance.",
