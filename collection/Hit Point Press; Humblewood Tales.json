One day, while wandering alone in the Wood at night, they met Tyton, who had come to collect their soul. Rather than accept their death with dignity, the sage instead debated with Tyton about the unfairness of mortality. Tyton could not deny their logic, but warned the heedless sage about disrupting the cycle of life and death. He wove a cloak from the fabric of the night sky itself, infused it with a small fraction of his power, and gifted it to the sage. With this, the sage could live forever. Tyton declared that he would return in a century, and if the sage still felt the same, the Amaranthine of death would never again visit them. For a hundred years, the sage watched everyone around them gradually age, succumbing to illness and death as they lived on. In the end, the sage understood their folly and asked for Tyton to guide them peacefully into the hereafter.

He wished for all to have beautiful, fungus-free homes filled with light and any food and drink they could imagine. Motivated partly by the guilt of leaving to study at the prestigious Avium, Lendarick poured his efforts into developing biddable and convenient slimes, and the Underfall began to thrive because of his work. Those who used the Roots for crime and held corrupt positions of power started to leave, moving on or reconsidering their crooked trade as it became less profitable. Lendarick believed he was making a better life for those he had left behind in the Underfall.",

In controlling the slimes with dark magic, he changed into something \"not-as-he-was.\" These magics were beyond the Amaranthines and beyond the knowledge of the Avium. Lendarick refused to eat and drink as the magics deepened his obsession with the plight of others. Weakened, the slimes began to overpower Lendarick's body and mind. The slimes he had controlled started to attack innocent folk, consuming them or maiming them with acrid ooze. Crime returned to the Roots, and Lendarick and his slimes disappeared to somewhere dark and forgotten.",

Most of their order were vulpin who believed themselves the rightful inheritors of Kren's power, though a handful of their members were birdfolk and humblefolk who decided that joining the evil order was preferable to suffering under it. Several months ago, Arrevis made such a deal with the Devotees of Kren, joining their occult order. A friend of his, a jerbeen named Chimdry Bress, joined with him. In addition to the security their new position afforded them, the pair were also gifted with powers of illusion and guile befitting servants of Kren.",

After months of harmless trickery, they began to test the limits of their power, allowing their little jests to evolve into outright theft and cruelty. With the powers of illusion at their fingertips, it felt natural for the pair to simply take whatever they wanted, and they hardly noticed that they had become no different from the Devotees of Kren they once feared.",
										"At the height of his devotion, Arrevis even built a shrine to Kren in the basement of his cottage and used it to make offerings to the shadowy Amaranthine. Yet, as Arrevis' cruel tricks grew greater and greater, so too did his arrogance. He stopped paying homage to Kren, and though Arrevis' callous greed failed to bother Kren's faithful, his disrespect towards their Amaranthine angered them greatly.",
										"The Devotees of Kren warned Arrevis that his hubris would invoke the Amaranthine's fury, but the raptor ignored their threats. Several weeks later, winter's frost set in, and Arrevis realized he hadn't heard from Chimdry in days. Arrevis traveled out into the woods, where he found Chimdry staggering about, emaciated, almost frozen to death, and digging frantically in the snow. The Devotees of Kren had stolen back the food and supplies Chimdry had taken from the other inhabitants of their region. As the jerbeen had earned nothing honestly that year, he was left to starve in the cold.",
										"Later that day, the Devotees of Kren dispatched a group of loyal Gloomweavers to kill Arrevis for his affront to their Amaranthine. The raptor fled and stole a boat from the harbor in the north and sailed into the trackless ocean in the hope that he could find a safe haven in an unknown land. In the open ocean, Arrevis was overtaken by a terrible storm. His little boat began to take on water. Climbing to the top of the mast as the rain and wind lashed him, Arrevis swore to the Altus, the Amaranthine who watches over those who challenge themselves and endure hardships, that if he survived, he would put his cruel ways behind him and work to better the lives of others. He let go of the mast and let the winds of the storm lift him. In a near-impossible feat, Arrevis flew on and on, propelled by the storm until he spotted the safety of Seawatch Tower. Just before he could reach it, Arrevis was struck by lightning.",

Once a powerful force during the founding of Alderheart, the Inquisitors have diminished in number and influence, clinging to a few ancient rights granted to them in more radical times and the limited support of a few conservative Council members. Their leverage is bolstered by a network of militant informants and a few powerful members who can bend the law in their favor when needed.",

The stone is in fact a rough chrysoberyl, and jewelers in larger cities pay up to 150 gp for it to use as raw material for their craft."

										"I didn't know I was doing it wrong, you see.",
										"When I was in high school, I most definitely was part nerd. A half-nerd. A nerdling, if you will. I loved comics, I loved science fiction, I read Stephen King like his books dripped blood and I was Nosferatu. But like a lot of young people, I just found it easier to keep my loves hidden and secret. I'm sure a lot of you have felt that desire, to protect a little piece of the true joy in your heart when you know full well not everyone will understand. Not everyone will cherish it like you do.",
										"Because that thing you love? Someone doesn't get it.",
										"Soon, I discovered Tolkien. And that made me love fantasy, from the Sword and Sorcery of Robert E. Howard and Ray Harryhausen, to the Shannara and all the other remarkable topography of the imagination. It all seemed so gorgeously {@i limitless}.",
										"I'm from a ridiculously small town in the middle of nowhere, maybe that's why these stories meant so much...grand vistas and tree cities, I wanted to go there. And then I found out you COULD. There was this thing out there, these books and boxed sets and weird dice. ROLE-PLAYING GAMES, sweet mama. And I wanted in.",
										"It blew my mind, I mean, the very {@i idea}. That you could live a story, be part of an adventure, in the Shire, in Cimmeria, even in some incredible landscape yet to be imagined. This part never fails to amuse me, but I got invited to play by the son of my hairdresser. He had a regular game with some friends (I didn't know it was kind of a date, no pressure).",
										"My friends, I loved it. I loved it to pieces. The rulebooks were nothing special, the art was very primitive. None of that mattered, I was hooked. I hung on every word. Remember that feeling? The first RPG you really lost yourself in? Rolling up your first character, drawing little maps of the dungeon so you didn't get lost on the way back? Your first natural 20, your first infuriating 01? Long story short, I ended up marrying the guy later. Lesson to everyone, RPGS promote romance! But it's what happened that night that I still think about. See, I loved the story we played, and I wanted so badly for there to be MORE of it.",
										"So I grabbed paper and markers and pens and did it myself. Part of the adventure was in a little town called Dane. I made a map of how I thought it looked, I made character sheets for the people living there. I made a graph of the dungeon we plundered. I drew sketches of the monsters we fought. Don't act like you don't know this feeling, you sly dog! With no cartography knowledge, I made maps. With no art skills, I drew characters. And with no writing experience, I wrote TALES.",
										"And I loved it. I happily brought all this stuff to the next session, and the DM and his friends were perfectly polite, but also a bit embarrassed. Because I didn't know...there were already books FULL of this stuff.",
										"I didn't know that there were books like the one you are holding in your hands. How could I? I thought you had to make that lore yourself. I know most of you know this feeling, when you open a sourcebook, or a really wonderful campaign book, or a great monster manual...and you just DEVOUR the wonders inside, right?",
										"That's how this book makes me feel every time I open it. It's all of those things. But at a level of craft and love and dedication so far beyond what I could ever have imagined back then. Mind-blowing art, paragraphs that deserve novels to be made from them. It's one of those wonderful, miraculous things that RPGs can do\u2014make a game book that you just want to sit and read until you are completely immersed and dragged under, to the point where you're not sure you ever want to go back. Until you look at the skin on your arm, and see only feathers.",
										"Hit Point Press kindly asked me to write a comic based on the Humblewood campaign setting, with art by the brilliant Sarah Webb. I loved it. After writing six hundred comics, I finally got to write a fantasy. And I've read the materials in the first set a dozen times. I think they topped themselves with this one. The new Tenders lore, the individual 'tales' of the title, my beloved shops and stores, and especially, the stunning Guide To Alderheart. It's a glorious vacation and adventure at once.",
										"I've talked about this setting before. If you've experienced it, you don't need me saying out wonderful it is. But it's everything I didn't have the skills to create after my first RPG and a million times more. That thing you love? It's right here, and they DEFINITELY get it. I love this hobby, and this book is a gateway to the best part of it.",

												"As artists we don't always have the opportunity to let our creativity run free. Projects often require us to adapt to stylistic guidelines that can sometimes limit an artist's creative freedom. It is rare that a commercial project aligns with our personal interests and we sometimes have to accommodate in order to create art for a living.",
												"This wasn't the case with Humblewood.",
												"When art director Leesha Hannigan contacted me at the end of 2018 and asked if I was interested in illustrating a critter-inhabited world named Humblewood, I had no idea what this extensive and lovingly designed setting would develop into one day. Neither did I know how much I would contribute to bringing this world to life.",
												"One illustration turned into dozens and I was given the opportunity to be part of the Humblewood concept art team. For the first time, I had almost no restrictions while working on a project and was not only able to pour all my creativity onto the paper, but also combine it with my two favorite things in the world: animals and nature. As someone who grew up in the German countryside surrounded by lots of wild parks, forests and nature, I've always had animal companions and can't imagine a life without them. Helping shape a world where critters play the leading roles was, and still is, something incredibly special to me.",
												"As an artist, what I find the most fascinating and fun is paying attention to the little things. Of course the broad strokes of a character, like what creature they are, how big or small they are, what colors they wear and so on, are important, but these things can feel empty and bland without the additional small touches that bring them to life. What bag is this character carrying? Is it decorated and if so, with what and how? How dirty or clean is this bag? What's inside? Do we see the things inside peeking out because the carrier likes to collect things, or have they just come home from a market? These are all questions I'm especially taken with as an artist and are essential to making a world appear full, alive and almost touchable for anyone who dives into it.",
												"I'm convinced that the best work happens when we create with true love in our hearts and I think this love is visible in every single page of the Humblewood books. It's a big part of why this world is so successful and loved by readers and players.",
												"In Germany we have a word for this: Herzblut. (Herz = Heart, Blut = Blood ) A poetic way of saying that we create with such passion and fire that our hearts start bleeding in the sense that it overflows with love and excitement.",
												"Over time, Humblewood has grown into a rich world with characters and creatures with history, and places that vibrate with rich colors and liveliness. Being part of Humblewood continues to be an ongoing adventure and I'm beyond excited to see where this journey is going to take me.",
												"Thanks to everyone who is part of Humblewood, be it the creative team or those of you who adventure in Humblewood, you make this world magical!"

As our scholars scrambled to collect the tales of the Wood onto parchment, they discovered that a single volume was not going to be enough to document it all. That is how the tome you hold in your hands, Humblewood Tales, came to be.",
								"While preparing the chapter on the calendar of Everden, our scholars discovered some strange documents from an unfamiliar source. Thus, we are pleased to include a copy of the mysterious Vaultkeeper Randmodius' thoughts on the calendar of Everden, both as a comprehensive guide to timekeeping and as a curiosity.",
								"As a traveler to the Wood, you might find yourself drawn to the Great Tree City of Alderheart\u2014a towering metropolis of bark, branch, and leaf\u2014but navigating your way through the city can be difficult for even the most seasoned explorer. To that end, this tome includes an exclusive printing of Jonall Hannu's acclaimed \"Traveler's Guide to Alderheart,\" a comprehensive guidebook to the culture and customs of Humblewood's capital. Learn the history of the Great Tree City, discover the most popular local cuisine, and most importantly, never get lost in Alderheart again!",
								"We've also included a handy guide to some of Humblewood's most famous (and infamous) merchants. You will find new merchandise on which to spend your coin and interesting vendors who might have work for you\u2014perhaps of the adventurous kind!",
								"Have you ever been curious about the Tenders of the Scorched Grove? Perhaps you have wondered what the Tenders are like elsewhere in Everden? You'll find many details here about the ranks and rituals of this mysterious organization. The Tenders channel the Great Rhythm in many extraordinary ways, and you can learn from them here as well: Train as a Circle of the Warden druid and protect the denizens of the Wood, gain arcane insight from nature with the wizarding tradition of Leyline Magic, or travel down a darker path with the Predator warlock patron.",
								"Finally, we have collected the Humblewood Tales themselves, stories of daring adventure from across the Wood. Help fight corrupted slime in the Roots of Alderheart, hunt down the legendary Loper, uncover the mysteries surrounding a young jerbeen who may be Wind-Touched, or venture to Saltar's Port to tangle with a wakewyrm or into the tragic memories of the enigmatic Seahawk. These tales are for you to make your own.",
								"There is more to be seen of the Humblewood than can ever be collected\u2014it is a task that will continue for a long time to come. Our hope is that with this tome in hand, you will be able to continue your exploration of Everden and create even more Humblewood Tales of your own.",

												"Over my long life, I have peered into countless worlds with grand civilizations where powerful magics and altered physical laws hold sway. I have witnessed the birth of gods and the deaths of entire cosmoses. So, naturally, it took me by surprise when a rather unremarkable little world piqued my interest.",
												"In my studies of \"Everden,\" as it is known by its inhabitants, I find myself just as intrigued by the customs of the creatures who make their homes here as by the tantalizing mysteries that lie at their world's center.",
												"Time has always fascinated me, more so now that I see it from the perspective of the infinite. I must admit, I was greatly amused by the oddly charming method the inhabitants of this place devised to chart the passage of time. It seems that the first record keepers of Everden's history were bards of some sort: these musicians began incorporating the noteworthy events of a solar revolution into a song that could be passed down through generations. As these minstrels traveled and shared their story-songs, their role evolved from the purely musical to the more consciously historical. They became known as \"songkeepers,\" though few who hold this office in Everden's present still practice music. In honor of these origins, time and history in Everden arestill recorded in musical terms, whether sung or not. Adorable.",
												"A solar year in Everden lasts for 360 days, and each of these years is known as a song. By their reckoning, the current calendar year is Song 786. Everden itself is far older, of course, though I doubt these limited beings will ever discover just how old...",
												"Nevertheless, their songkeepers continue to search for evidence of what happened \"in the time before song.\" Much of this ancient prehistory has passed into myth and legend. As expected, the creatures of Everden have failed time and again in their attempts to discern fact from fiction.",

From the East, as you leave the towering mountains, you'll find the land quickly slopes into a gentle valley. From there, if you follow the main road that winds between the great charred plains of the Scorched Grove and the marshes of the Mokk Fields, you'll be on your way to Alderheart.

										"Some have claimed that the tree has specially chosen them to make its will known by sending them visions or sharing dream-like scenes of things it has witnessed throughout its long life. Many earnestly trust those who claim to be blessed with the Evertree's revelations. However, while genuine cases have been documented, several claimants have been exposed as charlatans. Be wary of someone who asserts that they've been chosen by the Evertree, especially if they're trying to sell you something."

										"The first inhabitants of the tree now known as Alderheart were birdfolk. Nowadays, the different kinds of birdfolk of Humblewood see themselves as kith and kin, but in the distant past, they were distinct, self-governing peoples. The five birdfolk clans\u2014the corvums, the gallus, the lumas, the raptors, and the strigs\u2014lived apart. Birdfolk from different clans were just as likely to be enemies as friends, and each had their own ways and customs the others didn't care to understand.",
										"By the oldest evidence, Birdfolk began living in Alderheart as early as Song 198. The first to inhabit the Evertree were a band of outcasts from various birdfolk clans. Many were druids who led their companions to commune with the spirit of the Great Tree. They were the first to learn the tree's name, Alderheart. After hearing of their wish to coexist without the separation imposed by the clans, the Evertree invited this mixed group of birdfolk to live in its branches.",
										"The mighty Evertree taught the druids tree-shaping magic that allowed them to create homes and other structures within its trunk and branches and later within other trees, as long as the shaping was carried out with a tree's consent. Using this magic, the druids shaped stairways from the forest floor all the way to the very top of Alderheart. A temple to the birdfolk Amaranthines was fashioned within the Evertree, which would later become known as Holybranch. Around it, the first homes were shaped in the high branches of the Canopy.",
										"Over time, this small settlement grew into a haven for birdfolk who wished to escape the clans' endless feuding. The compassionate folk of the treetop turned away no peaceful soul. Alderheart became known as a neutral territory within the Wood: a place where all were welcome to live a life of harmony and pay homage to the spirits of nature.",
										"It wasn't just the birdfolk who found a home in the early days of Alderheart. Those who weren't birdfolk, the varied people commonly referred to as \"humblefolk\" in the Wood, lived in a village amidst the undergrowth near the northwest side of the tree. This settlement, Bramblewell, was established among the Evertree's exposed roots shortly after birdfolk started residing in the treetop. Bramblewell is a ruin now, but the surviving records estimate that it was founded around Song 208. By all accounts, Alderheart was more than big enough to support both settlements, and the two communities coexisted peacefully for decades.",
										"By Song 353, the birdfolk had finished shaping the great treetop temple to the Amaranthines they named Holybranch. Pilgrims visiting Holybranch would pass through Bramblewell with coin to spend and wares to trade. Thanks to the travelers, Bramblewell thrived. The treetop community also blossomed, becoming a monastic center. Skilled healers and those in tune with the spirits of nature flocked to it. The Canopy was considered a sacred place, close to the Great Rhythm. Though eager to accept temple acolytes and visiting pilgrims, it grew more slowly than Bramblewell below. While neither community grew wealthy, they both prospered and knew little hardship. However, this time of peace didn't last."

In Song 402, they joined together to form a great pack of thieves known as the Bandit Coalition under a mysterious figure known only as The Robber King. To this day, the Bandit Coalition's name and insignia are used by brigands to spark fear in the hearts of honest folk.",
										"The Coalition raided every corner of the land. Even the birdfolk in their lofty perches weren't safe. The bandits came prepared. With ropes, ladders, and cunning tactics, the settlements of the Wood were ransacked one by one. Only the Evertree was left unscathed. Its trunk was too tall to scale, its stairways too narrow to storm, and its bark too thick to burn.",
										"Vulnerably located on the forest floor, Bramblewell was attacked by the Coalition. However, thanks to the warnings from the acolytes watching high above for approaching marauders, the folk of Bramblewell were able to take shelter high in the Evertree while the Bandit Coalition sacked their little town. With the assistance of their neighbors from the Canopy, each time Bramblewell was raided, its people rebuilt it stronger than before. Bramblewell raised stone walls and other fortifications, ruined traces of which can still be seen. Townsfolk with combat skills organized themselves into a trained militia, becoming a bulwark against the bandit raids.",

By supporting each other, both communities were strong enough to resist the worst of the Bandit Coalition's onslaught together.",

										"As the Bandit crisis in the Wood continued on song after song and more folk fled to Alderheart, it became clear that the small community had to grow and change. In Song 411, as the Bandit Coalition swept across the Wood in their fiercest attacks yet, the birdfolk and humblefolk sent representatives to Bramblewell to attend the Conference of Glimmercall. There they discussed how to organize themselves to stand against the bandit assault. Those who gathered there would drastically change the course of history in the Wood.",
										"After days of heated debate, Edwin Ebonheart, a wizard who had long studied the magic of the Evertree, received a vision from the Great Tree itself. Alderheart expressed its wish to shelter the people of the Wood from the Bandit Coalition. Carrying the Evertree's message, Edwin suggested building a safe haven for those fleeing the Bandit Coalition: a true city in the branches and trunk of Alderheart, far greater than the small enclave that already existed. While all saw the wisdom in this plan, disagreement over who would lead this new city ensued. Fennel Jeramis, mayor of Bramblewell, expressed concerns over losing autonomy if her town was merged with the new city above. In the face of this reluctance, it was put forward that a city founded by members from each birdfolk clan would serve as a unifying force but that there would be resistance from the birdfolk clans should this be expanded to include humblefolk. Eventually, without an enthusiastic consensus, matters were resolved: the birdfolk would form a council to oversee the new treetop city and ensure equity between the birdfolk clans.",
										"Meanwhile, the humblefolk would retain full control of Bramblewell below but would not have a say in the ruling of the city above.",
										"Ava Windsweft heartily agreed to this plan, seeing the potential to rally the feuding birdfolk clans behind a common cause and end the feuds that had troubled the birdfolk for generations. The last to agree was Mayor Jeramis, agreeing to support the new city because it could bring more prosperity to her humblefolk-governed town of Bramblewell. Additionally, the newly-formed city would be sworn to help and protect Bramblewell. However, this promise would be broken only a few decades later in the eyes of Bramblwell's last residents as Alderheart stood idly by while its neighbor collapsed into disrepair. With the final terms agreed to, construction on the treetop city of Alderheart began on the 30th day of the Glimmercall chorus, Song 411."

Hevod's grandest designs eventually became the foundation for the city's Canopy level. With the military-minded Grido Snowtarn's guidance, Hevod designed the city's fortified entry points to prevent infiltration by smugglers and bandit scouts. Grido was knowledgeable in the ways of war and wanted to ensure the new city's defenses were as solid as the mountain homes of his people.",
										"Unlike the later construction, you'll notice that older buildings and structures in the Canopy aren't magically shaped out of Alderheart's living timber. The city's first phase was built quickly, so very little tree shaping could be used. This architectural legacy can be seen today in both new and old homes belonging to the wealthy in the Canopy. Alderheart's elites continue to favor a classic architectural style that uses materials from across Humblewood and does not incorporate shaping.",
										"This foundational style emerged from Edwin's collaborations with Geswick Switch, whom he would later fall for, and relied heavily on the mapach inventor's efficient system of lifts and pulleys. The dynamic pair established walkways and stabilizing platforms to keep structures built closer to the edge of branches accessible and make them resilient against storms. Edwin, who possessed an interest in astronomy, also commissioned the first great observatory in the Canopy.",
										"As the fledgling city was being constructed, Ferro Keer trained anyone who volunteered in the ways of agile branch-to-branch combat and archery. The armed company she founded would become the backbone of Humblewood's defenses, the force now known as the Perch Guard. While many birdfolk excelled in techniques of branch skirmishing and dive attacks, these fighting styles relied on gliding and weren't suited to the humblefolk of Bramblewell. Instead, Ferro focused on training the humblefolk to use ranged weapons. Though the Perch Guard of today is associated with the agile, spear-wielding techniques of its birdfolk contingent, the first Perch Guard was equally composed of humblefolk archers and birdfolk skirmishers."

However, the early city wasn't much more than a fortified settlement built up around the Holybranch temple. The developing city flourished, drawing many people from across the Wood as the word spread that Alderheat was founded on the ideals of safety and cooperation.",
										"However, The Robber King also heard the rumors of the city built to resist them and made plans to crush the young city to maintain the Coalition's stranglehold on the Wood. Fortunately, Alderheart caught wind of the plan and had time to prepare while the bandits organized their scattered forces. This conflict came to a head in Song 413 at The Battle of Alderheart.",
										"At the start of summer, the Bandit Coalition launched a ferocious attack against the Great Tree City. Armed with flaming catapults and great ballistae, the Coalition's goal was to topple the Evertree and with it the fragile hope that anyone in the Wood could resist their might. In the face of the assault, Alderheart's founders led the Perch Guard in defense of the city. The battle lasted ten days, filled with bitter fighting and great losses on both sides. The steadfast leadership of the founders and the discipline of Alderheart and Bramblewell's combined forces won out, finally routing the bandits. The Robber King is believed to have died in this battle. No records referring to the Coalition's leader exist after this point, though many others using the title have popped up throughout history, claiming to be descendants of the original Robber King. This defeat hobbled the Coalition's forces and led to the end of their threat to the Wood.",

Therefore, with a mission to foster a sense of unity among the five birdfolk clans and govern over Alderheart, the first Birdfolk Council was established by Ava, along with representatives from the other four clans. Given Ava's diplomatic and fair nature, the Council unanimously voted for her to lead it as the first Speaker.",

Soon, the great markets in the Canopy and Trunk were constructed, new residents set up homes on the new branchroads, and tunnels were excavated throughout the Trunk.",

The call of fortune in the city above outsung any loyalty many had to Bramblewell below. Bramblewell was able to sustain itself for some time but began to fall into disrepair as its folk moved up into Alderheart, seeking opportunity and prosperity. This issue was brought to the attention of the Bird Folk Council many times by the leaders of Bramblewell, but Alderheart, preoccupied with its own affairs, neglected the failing town. By Song 448, Bramblewell had been abandoned completely. Now only overgrown ruins remain of the once proud community, but its legacy lives on in the humblefolk who reside in Alderheart to this day."

										"The next great expansion of the city came in the aftermath of what is called The Great Calamity. During the summer of Song 486, a forest fire of unprecedented proportions raged through the Wood. This event is forever remembered by the folk of the Wood as the Great Calamity. Nobody knows exactly how the fire was first lit nor finally extinguished, but the blaze reduced the entire western section of the forest to cinders, leaving behind a flame-cursed plain of ash known as the Scorched Grove. In all my travels, I've never seen anything quite like it. It mars the Wood like a scar: an eerie place of searing winds, smoldering soil, and strange monsters. I'd give the Scorched Grove a wide berth, dear traveler, as it is filled with dangers.",
										"In the aftermath of the Great Calamity, many who lived in the area that became the Scorched Grove, mostly humblefolk, had lost loved ones, homes, and livelihoods to the inferno. They looked to Alderheart for aid. The Birdfolk Council responded by decreeing that new spaces and branchroads be shaped in the lower Trunk to make homes for the influx of new residents. Since the Calamity, humblefolk have outnumbered birdfolk in Alderheart but still did not gain representation on the Council. At the time, the Birdfolk Council chose to view the refugees as guests rather than true citizens of Alderheart. The shortfall of not including humblefolk representation on the Council is still a dark mark on the city's history. It prevented humblefolk from sharing valuable perspectives on how the city could benefit all its residents.",
										"As the Trunk filled, the city began turning folk away, claiming that there were not enough resources to sustain all the refugees. Those desperately seeking a home began to dig into Alderheart's roots secretly. Though crude at first, a network of tunnels formed over time, and small communities developed within them. For these root-dwellers, life was hard, and some resorted to thievery and smuggling to survive. The communities in the roots were an open secret for generations. The Council only publicly acknowledged the existence of the secret tunnels in Song 721 and promptly sent tree-shapers to fill in the tunnels. However, Alderheart refused the tree-shapers. The Evertree wished to provide shelter to those who needed it, and the mighty Alderheart bid the tree-shapers strengthen the tunnels, shape proper homes for the Root-dwellers, and connect them to the rest of the city instead.",
										"In Song 723, after a change in leadership, the Council agreed to expand the once clandestine tunnels, and the area became formally known as the Roots, the last official level of the city. Today, the Roots continue to be stigmatized by narrow-minded folk as a place of crime and villainy. Life in the Roots is still tough compared to the other levels of Alderheart, but for those who live there, it is their home, and they are proud of it."

Many songs have been written about the Patchwork\u2014the gate that wouldn't fall\u2014and it has become a symbol of resilience for Alderites. The Patchwork Gate is located on the Evertree's southeast side, and though it used to handle foot traffic, it now deals largely with carts carrying freight and goods. Normally, this is the gate of choice for farmers and traders laden with goods from the perch of Brackenmill and those carrying potions and books from the Avium."

Located on the Evertree's west side, it was meant as an entry point for villagers fleeing the destruction of their homes in the Calamity's wake. The gate is staffed by a small team of laborers, with lifts designed for smaller hand-pulled carts and wagons rather than the larger ones used by merchant caravans. The gate can handle both freight and foot traffic, but it mainly sees use by folks who travel light. Anyone laden with too much cargo is directed south toward the Bastion Gate. These days, the Wealdway Gate is mainly used by Tenders journeying to and from the Scorched Grove and its surrounding areas and anyone who wants to avoid heavy traffic."

Its name comes from the fact that it was made to welcome folks coming on foot to the city from the eastern roadways, and its creation marked the transition of the Patchwork into a freight entrance. Seen as the most modern gate, the Welcomeway has received a lot of care and maintenance over the years. Its pleasing appearance and ease of use have earned it the nickname \"The Friendly Gate.\" Though it mainly handles foot traffic, the Welcomeway Gate boasts innovative hand crank-operated lifts. Though only suitable for smaller cargo, travelers can operate these lifts themselves, a great convenience for those in a hurry. In addition, the Welcomeway sports a few reinforced pulley lifts, crewed by teams in the Canopy to handle heavy loads.

The gate takes its name from its position directly above the ruins of the old village of Bramblewell. The gate was designed as an access point for those living in smaller villages in the more remote parts of the Wood to the north of Alderheart. It is mainly equipped to handle foot traffic, with small freight lifts suitable only for large hand carts.

The rise of the Council wiped out what remained of the clans' influences. In time, the Council came to govern the whole of the Wood.

Mapach cuisine uses pungent smoke to impart strong flavors to various ingredients, including wild game, a mix of earth-grown and tree-grown vegetables, and berries. Traditional jerbeen meals are made to be shared. Grains feature more prominently in jerbeen cooking than in other humblefolk traditions, and jerbeens are known for their baking. Hedge cooking emphasizes incorporating different cooking styles, such as steaming, frying, and grilling, within one meal to create a balanced whole.

Farmers care for the caterpedes until late summer when the caterpedes begin to pupate into cosmoths. Should you happen to be in the market for silk thread, take my advice and wait until Raycrest to buy. The grubs produce more as they get ready to turn into {@creature Cosmoth|HumblewoodTales|cosmoths}, and farmers in the city sell their excess at a lower price."

						"The Tales From The Wood are a series of short, self-contained adventures which can be completed over one or multiple sessions, depending on your players and GM style. Each adventure can be enjoyed on its own as a one-shot introduction to Humblewood or added to an existing Humblewood game. Should you desire, you can change the locations or story elements present in an adventure to suit the pace and tone of your game. You can even break these adventures up and use them as pieces to build your own custom campaign.",
						"This section contains the following five adventures, organized by their suggested character level:",
						"{@adventure The Wind-Touched|HumblewoodTales-WindTouched|0} was written by Dominik Parisien and tells the story of a curious occurrence in the normally quiet town of Marshview, where a local jerbeen is rumored to have gained the power of flight. At the same time, a great monstrosity has begun to terrorize the trade roads around the city. Could the two be related? This charming adventure is perfect for a party of 3rd-level characters.",
						"{@adventure The Wakewyrm's Fury|HumblewoodTales-WakewyrmsFury|0} was Hit Point Press' contribution to 2020's Free RPG Day. It features an exciting trek through an enormous sea cave near Saltar's Port, where pirate poachers have hidden themselves away from the local authorities. Tricks, traps, and a fearsome beast await! Woe betides those who earn the wakewyrm's fury. This daring expedition is well suited to a party of 5th-level characters.",
						"{@adventure The Seahawk|HumblewoodTales-Seahawk|0} was penned by James Haeck and centers around a mysterious series of events in Saltar's Port. It all begins when a thunderstorm knocks a traveling raptor from the sky, and a mysterious ship docks at the harbor. Who are the shadowy strangers which emerged from that boat, and what do they want with the Seahawk? This noir mystery is full of thrills and chills for a party of 5th-level characters.",

The Crimson Rose regularly welcomes customers from the nearby port and from villages all along the Talongrip Coast.",

She was once a captain in the Saltar's Port Coast Guard before her retirement, after which she had her ship dismantled and rebuilt as a seaside shop. Petra settled into the life of a merchant but has never quite left her seafaring ways behind her. A few of her crew members followed her after being honorably discharged.

One of her more distinguishing features is her left arm, which is missing wing feathers. This injury was caused by the bolt of a heavy ballista, which struck her during a heated battle against pirates. Petra survived, but her injury never healed properly, and she permanently lost the ability to glide. Eventually, Petra's age caught up with her, and she chose to retire honorably rather than risk the safety of the ships under her protection. As a reward for her years of loyal service, she was allowed to keep her ship, The Crimson Rose. As the ship was also showing its age, Petra decided to run it aground and use its remains to build the quiet seaside shop she had always dreamed of owning.",

Thankfully, her former career protecting merchant fleets means she knows many seafaring traders grateful for her service and captains who are happy to provide her with preferential prices on their extraordinary stock.",

Her unvarnished opinions can rub some folks the wrong way, but the strength of her convictions is inspirational, and she always seems to have the right words to rouse the spirits of others. She usually takes a hands-on approach to managing her staff.

His position as an enforcer left him with few friends in the Coalition, save for a jerbeen named Durban Softpad. Durban had also grown up in the Roots, in a district known as Pestlehaven, and the two became fast friends, bonding over their experiences. When Liann, a free-spirited jerbeen swashbuckler, joined their gang, Cathus watched as his best friend fell in love. It wasn't long before Cathus was attending Durban and Liann's wedding, and the couple somehow managed to make a life for themselves and have a child while on the road with the Coalition. Throughout all of it, Cathus remained close to the couple. Cathus often visited Liann to deal with chores and help her care for her newborn son, Finnan, whenever Durban was occupied with banditry. Despite the cruelty Cathus witnessed and even wrought upon others in his time as an enforcer, the love and care he saw in Liann and Durban's small family filled him with hope.",
										"One day, while delivering a message on orders from her captain, Liann was captured by the Perch Guard. From loosemuzzled bandits, Cathus discovered that Liann had been set up by the Coalition. The Coalition's spies had learned the Perch Guard had been preparing a trap to capture Liann's unit captain, and Liann had been sent into the ambush instead to take the fall. Cathus reluctantly kept the information to himself, lest Durban do something reckless, but it cost the mapach what little faith he had left in the Coalition.",
										"Not long after, as their unit started to dwindle due to arrests or worse fates, Cathus and Durban were sent out together on raids. A few months later, they were found by the Perch Guard alone, robbing a cart. Durban allowed himself to be captured so that Cathus could escape, but not before making Cathus vow to take care of Finnan. Durban's last words to Cathus were: \"Don't let him turn out like us.\" Upon his return, Cathus attempted to leave the Coalition, assuming that his years of loyal service would allow him to retire quietly. Instead, he was told by his captain, a cruel hedge known as {@creature Aster the Thorn|HumblewoodTales} [he/him], that he would begin fencing stolen property for the Coalition somewhere discreet. Cathus begrudgingly accepted on the condition that Aster promised to leave Finnan out of their business. Aster agreed, knowing he could use Finnan to keep Cathus in line.",
										"Cathus took Finnan on as his ward and has tried to raise the boy in keeping with his promise to Durban. As far as Cathus knows, Finnan has no living relatives besides his parents, who won't be released from Alderheart's prison until Finnan is grown. Cathus hopes he can provide a better life for the boy, but he feels great guilt about his situation. Cathus wishes they could leave for somewhere better, but the risk of such a flight is too great so long as Aster remains."

Zifa has worked her way up from nothing, and she flaunts her refined manners and excellent sense of style as a way of distancing herself as much as possible from her former life. She is keenly aware of the debt she owes to the Windswefts. Both her sense of personal pride and her desire to please her benefactors have led to her working tirelessly to improve Zephyr & Co. Zifa is also well paid for her efforts, and she wishes to save as much coin as possible to ensure she and her mother need never worry about returning to a life of poverty. Her financial success has even allowed her to support her aging mother with a comfortable home in the Canopy. Zifa has run the store for five years now and has accrued a great deal of experience and a keen sense for business.",

Living in poverty taught her that not everyone in the world can succeed, so she cut ties with everyone in her old life except for her mother, believing that they would only hold her back. As someone who built herself up from nothing, she has no patience for people who don't meet the high standards she sets for herself and her clientele. Zifa makes people who appear unable to afford her wares feel unwelcome in the store, and she insists they only return once they have made something of themselves. Although she takes pride in how far she's come, she keeps her past as a Trunk urchin under wraps for fear of how it would reflect on both her business and her employers.

Zifa knew from a young age that she needed to help her mother for the two of them to survive, so she worked any odd job she could find, despite having little skill. She eventually turned to thievery out of desperation and was caught by a hedge street musician named {@creature Moonflower|HumblewoodTales|Moonflower Mosswell} [she/her]. Instead of turning Zifa in, Moonflower hired her. She found that Zifa had an incredible voice, and she began to train the young luma to perform alongside her. It was the first job Zifa managed to keep, and although she never made much, the small share she took home helped a great deal.",
										"One day, Zifa's performance was overheard by Abel and Aria Windsweft, the heads of their illustrious noble house. The Windswefts were enchanted by the young girl and were so moved by her plight that they offered Zifa and her mother jobs as servants in their manor. The pair worked for the Windswefts for years, and Zifa was educated in manners, etiquette, and proper ways to behave around the upper class. She was precocious and learned much from the nobles while serving at galas and banquets held by the family.",
										"As time went on, it became clear to the Windswefts that Zifa was being stifled in her position. She had a talent for numbers and organization, which led to Zifa taking over management of the other servants, as well as many housekeeping responsibilities, including making necessary purchases for the estate. Recognizing her talent, the Windswefts asked her to assist in the stockroom at Zephyr & Co., one of the family's stores that was struggling at the time. Zifa found that her work for the store was more fulfilling than working as a servant, but she felt guilty for wanting to leave her position at Windsweft manor. The Windswefts noticed, and rather than waste her talents, they encouraged Zifa to pursue full-time employment at the store.",
										"In a short time, thanks to her hard work and skill, Zifa earned a promotion to store manager, where her insights helped the struggling store blossom into what it is today. Zifa is forever grateful to the Windswefts. She cares deeply for her work and has made it her personal mission to make the store as successful as possible."

The clan lives in harmony with a herd of giant bison-like creatures called gargaths protecting the herd from danger, caring for the sick or injured among them, and shepherding them to the best grazing areas throughout the year. In return, the Hannu harvest milk from the gargaths and shear their thick winter coats in the spring to make warm clothing and blankets.",

These new places, filled with diverse peoples and differing ways of life, intrigued Jonall from a young age. This passion for discovery was fueled by Jonall's eldest brother, who taught her to read. Together, through books, they learned about the wondrous places beyond the vast plains of their home and planned to travel the world together. However, one year at the height of summer, a deadly plague known as \"the languishing\" spread throughout the Hannu camp. While the young Jonall survived, many, including her brother, did not. The loss devastated Jonall, but it drove her to pursue her dream of traveling the world.",

The treants taught the sage about the forest, the creatures they shared it with, and how all are cradled within the Great Rhythm's embrace. The sage used their teachings to found the Tenders, an order sworn to uphold the balance of natural forces. Although the sage's name has been lost to history, the Tenders persist to this day.",
						"As humble caretakers of the Wood, the first Tenders studied the interconnectedness of all life and the practice of gentle, natural magic. The treants' teachings helped the Tenders heal the forest from blights and fires. Tenders protected small woodland villages and used their magic to provide support in times of hardship. Possessing a deep insight into the Great Rhythm, the Tenders came to be seen as a bridge between the will of the Wood and the people who lived there and soon became an established presence in the Wood.",
						"The order faced its greatest challenge during the Great Calamity. As fires raged unabated, incinerating nearly a third of Humblewood's woodland, the Tenders helped those fleeing the blaze. The flames left their scar upon the forest, an area called the Scorched Grove, and the Tenders took it upon themselves to restore the corrupted earth. Their search to correct the elemental imbalance of the Scorched Grove led the Tenders to incorporate disparate schools of magic into their teachings. Most notably, they merged the scholarly approach of Avium wizards with the harmonious teachings of their druidic arts. With this new understanding of arcana, the Tenders have made steady progress toward healing the Grove's corruption.",
						"As certain Tenders dedicated their lives to healing the Scorched Grove, others pledged to mend the world in different ways. Some organized into a force of field medics to aid during natural upheavals, while others became healers, teachers, and tree-shapers. Tenders traveled across Everden, where they discovered lands suffering dangerous elemental imbalances. To meet these challenges, the formerly loose association of Tenders divided themselves into distinct chapters called Branches. Each Branch of the Tenders has an elected leader called a treekeeper. Once every fifty songs, treekeepers convene to share what each Branch has learned. Treekeepers also hold urgent meetings when necessary but are otherwise absorbed in their own tasks.",

Their leaves burned to ash, their bodies charred and splintered. Through it all, the treants stood tall and firm, sheltering the Wood until a ritual abated the Calamity...though who knows for how long.",

Each treant had its own grove and tended to all things living within it. The old stories say we took our name from the treants, for we too aspired to be Tenders of the forest. Being long-lived, the treants knew much of the Wood's history, and, though they were towering creatures, not even the smallest seed escaped their notice. Above all else, they were teachers, and that is what we Tenders must strive to be. With the eldest and wisest of the treants lost to the flames, we must take their place, not only as keepers of lore and stewards of nature, but as those who tend to the very spirit of this world."

They are led by Cain of the Sunsworn Oath, who possesses a boundless curiosity. He scours the dangerous ruins of ancient civilizations, searching for any lost lore that may help their cause."
