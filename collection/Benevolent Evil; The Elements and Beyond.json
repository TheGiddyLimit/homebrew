Appendix B gives spell specialization lists for the new feats, divided by class. Appendix C provides a set of spell lists that can be used for monsters, as origin spells for sorcerers, and as replacements for spells that this document references from {@i Xanathar's Guide to Everything} and {@i Tasha's Cauldron of Everything}, for the groups that don't have access to those books.

And combining elements can create acid, lightning, poison, and other manifestations of energy or magic found in the many existing spells that aren't on any elemental spell lists.",

The effects of spell prowess are not likely to severely break the game, but spells that aren't on these lists have not been fully balanced for it. However, a PC that takes multiple specialization feats to gain spell prowess with more and more lists could be considered to have paid the cost for such power. As always, the decision is yours. You are free to allow some spells and not others, even when both groups of spells are made of the same combined elements.

Once the Feywild had shaped them into much smaller forms, many of these elves fled to the relative safety of the Material Plane, where they still live in secluded villages. Other worlds feature thimble elves that were once elves of a more common variety before being warped and altered by a powerful curse or fey magic.",

The majority of these crystalkin, which are called shardminds, stay within the Astral Plane their entire lives.

While they can't speak with the Mother Crystal directly, they can still feel its soothing psychic presence, which helps them center their mind and focus on the world around them.",

They spend extended time in the celestial planes, where they are transformed by positive energy into translucent crystalkin called glasshearts, losing their connection to the Mother Crystal but gaining an affinity for celestials and divine magic. Glasshearts are no longer soothed by the Mother Crystal, but the celestial light that they have been infused with soothes them in its place.",

These crystalkin can, like the glasshearts, lose their connection to the Mother Crystal, but unlike the glasshearts they are not filled with a new astral energy.

Other tales speak of crystalkin that became little more than mindless elementals, or of crystalkin that, in their emptiness, bargained with fiends for purpose and power, and in the process became fiends themselves.",

								"The true appearance of a deepling is a rare sight even for its companions. The deepling body resembles a large octopus with a more humanoid head.

They don't have a brain, and their ability to think is distributed across their entire body. Because of this, their tentacles sometimes move on their own, and most deeplings that travel on land keep them bound together under clothing to conceal them and prevent them from wandering where they shouldn't.",

Their strange octopus-like eyes, which are usually yellow, green, or blue, however, can't be disguised in this way.",
								"Most adult deeplings that live with other races spend their time imitating that race or another race that has gained their fancy. By twisting their many tentacles into shapes across their malleable body, they can closely imitate the body shape, skin, and even some of the facial features of other humanoids. They coil four or more tentacles into the shape of legs and walk awkwardly upon them, using their remaining tentacles to form the upper body. Deeplings often wear bulky clothing and other elements of nonmagical disguise to complete the facade for day-to-day ease.",
								"Despite taking these efforts to hide their true nature, deeplings rarely manage to avoid standing out in a crowd, either because of the strange dress they use to disguise themselves, the odd face that can never be perfectly disguised, or the alien behavior resulting from their lonely upbringing. It is common for a deepling to be unable to truly pass as the race they are disguised as, but such a disguise does still hide the deepling's true appearance from the world."

				"Normally, specializing in poison damage can become problematic when encountering enemies that are immune to it. Most undead, elementals, and constructs are immune to poison damage, and many other creatures can be resistant or even immune to it. This makes poison damage weaker than the other damage types, which can feel bad for a player controlling a poison-focused character.",

When using this rule, beasts and humanoids who have a Constitution score of 8 or lower automatically have vulnerability to poison damage on account of their fragile bodily health. This does not apply this to player characters."

However, it often happens that these subclasses grant movement options that are already granted by the race, such as a swimming or flying speed, creating frustration for some players concerned with abilities that aren't useful. To help alleviate these frustrations without significantly changing game balance, your DM can choose to use the following optional rule.",

					"Some goblins are born with a wild magic connection to the chaos of storms and wind Goblin magic is nearly always wild and chaotic, and the aeromancies of goblin wind rousers are no exception.",
					"Wind rousers are usually flighty and scatterbrained, with extreme difficulty focusing on any single task for very long. They are regarded as unstable and mad even by other goblins, with most goblins staying clear of the wild power these sorcerers wield, lest they be hurled into the sky or tossed off a cliff accidentally. Despite this element of chaos, goblins still celebrate the wind rouser when their wind earns the goblins victory in battle, and most tribes are happy to keep a wind rouser around for warfare, so long as they stay safely at the edge of camp.",
					"The most powerful of goblin wind rousers make allies of minor air elementals such as blowing spirits or dust mephits. They use their natural gifts to speak with the elementals, and their strange way of thinking makes it easier for them to connect with those creatures that are not native to the Material Plane. The mages command these elemental spirits in battle or send them ahead of the goblin forces to scout and spy on foes. Wind rousers can typically control these elementals for weeks or even months, but the bond is never permanent. The chaotic nature of the goblin mage's magic will eventually disrupt their control over these elementals, allowing them to escape."

She listens across the entire world like a spider listens to vibrations in its web, and she can hear secrets and stories as they are whispered from ear to ear. The Web Weaver is not an incarnation of a specific type of land, but is instead connected to the passage of time and history itself. She remembers all the stories of the other spirits, such as when Coyote tricked Ram off of its cliff, or when the Weaver herself changed her shape to steal the sun for Eagle to hold in its talons.",

The Weaver tests those who seek to be her champion with many tales, asking them to identify the truth and the lies. Though there are few tales that the Weaver does not know, they do exist, and bringing her a story she has never heard before is one certain way to gain her attention and favor."

But many spiders escaped to the Elemental Planes, where they thrived in numbers far beyond those produced by the azer spider breeders. Some have even made it to the Underdark, where they hunt other spiders by chasing them onto their webs, igniting the webbing. Scorch spiders aren't harmed by the fire and they're immune to spider venom, making them a terror to natural spider species.",

They devour elementals just as eagerly as they do creatures made of flesh or the fresh ashes of such creatures. The carapace of a scorch spider, which often grows to be a foot long or more, is said to be as hard as diamond and always searing hot, just like their fiery blood.",
