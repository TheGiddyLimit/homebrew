They play a huge part in the economy of Aysta, and were originally invented by Prismatic Falls for the purpose of having an intelligent, subservient workforce that could be manufactured on demand. Souls were discovered as the most suitable power source for the automatons, but this created a small quirk; {@b they could feel emotion} and were essentially real people, though different from the person whose soul was used to power them.",

The soulfueled can glean knowledge or experience from these nightmares, although the mental toll they take can sometimes outweigh the benefits. Older soulfueled who have replaced their power source multiple times will have considerably more nightmares than a freshlybooted soulfueled, as more memories are trapped within their body."

It compresses back into a small rod when it is reduced to 0 hit points and can't turn back into its cycle form until it regains at least 1 hit point.

Any increase to your speed applies to the cycle while you ride it, including if you take the {@action Dash} action. Creatures have disadvantage on opportunity attacks against you and your cycle while you ride it. While you ride your cycle, you can force any attack targeted at you to target it, or vice versa.",

Evolutionists often chase after their personal concept of a perfected body, often driven by perceptions of physical weakness, mental ineptitude, or visual unattractiveness. The pursuit of perfection is not without its risks, however. Paradoxically, these same individuals who see the body as a form of expression have a tendency to dissociate from it as they stack up modifications. Some come to perceive the body as little more than a tool or vehicle operated by the brain or soul.

While these physically orientated modifications give them the capability to fight toe to toe with the best of martial combatants, evolutionists have greater ambitions. They push their enhancements further than their body can handle, tearing into their own vitality. Endurance is the most important quality for an evolutionist; the ability to suffer through their ambition is paramount to their success.

Dealing with such reactions on a daily basis, evolutionists tend to be able to overcome others' opinions of them with relative ease. Some evolutionists are timid and self-conscious, trying to blend in and cowering at hostility. Others relish the notoriety, happily claiming the spotlight\u2014even negative attention is attention.

						"A curseborn Psychopomp kneels over the corpse of a thug in an alley, extracting the recently deceased man's soul to place in a battery. A rival Psychopomp spots her, and tries to intervene and claim the soul for himself. Before he can reach her, the curseborn raises an arm, and the man is stunned in place. As the curseborn's soul holds him, she begins incanting a spell, and all the Psychopomp can do is watch his obliteration come.",

								"Soulshapers are mystical spiritualists who can effortlessly manipulate the spectral energy of their soul and the souls of others. Their powers are awakened by a moment of sudden enlightenment, rarely found through meditation but more commonly realized through a near-death experience. Their powers continue to develop based on the emotion that revealed them, from serene acceptance to a furious desire for revenge."

								"Soulshapers can see the souls of the living and the dead, and can physically manipulate them. They are mediums between life and death, and between the Ethereal and Material Planes. Soulshapers use their powers for different purposes; some use their ability to physically manipulate souls to become Psychopomps or work with Soul Batteries, while others use their intimate knowledge of emotions to become negotiators, counselors or politicians. Some soulshapers who awaken their potential on the streets will use their powers nefariously, becoming thieves or scam artists with their abilities complimenting their natural talents."

								"The moment of awakening is different for every soulshaper, but it is always a moment of intense emotion. For some, this is a moment of acceptance; a resignation to their death before being saved by an outside source. Soulshapers who awaken this way feel a sense of calm each time they channel their powers\u2014after all, each moment they are alive is a bonus, and every effect they can have is one they may not have had otherwise. For others, it is a moment of pure terror, where they will do anything in their power to survive and their soul responds. These soulshapers channel their powers on pure adrenaline and instinct, recalling the moment when they brushed with death. Others still are so overcome with rage that they begin using their powers before they even realize what they are capable of. Their pure desire for revenge for whatever reason drives the use of their powers, and every time they channel their abilities, they return to that blood-boiling moment of fury."

								"Awakening one's power is the easy part. Soulshapers draw their power directly from within themselves, and rigorous meditation is needed to hone their connection to their soul and the world around them. The meditative practices of a soulshaper varies based on their discipline, and this meditation allows them to not only enhance their powers, but develop new ones. A soulshaper can never improve without taking the time to focus inwards."

								"When creating a soulshaper, you should first consider an event that caused your character to awaken their powers. Was it a terrible crime they witnessed? A grievous injury they survived? An acceptance of their fate before they were saved? Your decision will affect not only how your character harnesses their powers, but also how they act both in and out of combat. Soulshapers are defined by emotion, and it is important to consider the emotional aspect you wish to focus on.",
								"Next, decide on what your character uses this newfound power for. Do they use their abilities to help others, or do they use them selfishly? Do they flaunt their powers or hide them? Have they sought a teacher to learn their powers, or do they experiment alone? Consider these questions when shaping the history of your character, as they will provide a foundation for decisions later on, both in character creation and in game.",
