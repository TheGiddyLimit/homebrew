In addition, firearms release a small puff of smoke when fired. Characters hoping to move or fight undetected would be wise to use other weapons. For game masters, be aware of the sight, sound, and smell of firearms and the possibility of such effects alerting other nearby creatures, but also be aware these effects are just as likely to startle or scare away creatures as it is to draw them."

If you roll the highest possible number on an individual damage die (such as a 6 on a d6 or a 12 on a d12) when you attack with this weapon, you can roll that die again and add the result to the total.

The character adds those results to the current damage total for a final damage total of 26. Since the character's proficiency bonus is +2, the character can't reroll the new 6, ending the gunpowder bursts for that attack. When that character makes another attack with the {@item pistol|ToH}, this process starts anew.",

(If the check had failed, the group could try again after a month, gaining a +5 bonus to the check. If that roll failed, the next check would be made another month later with a +10 bonus, and so on, until they finally manage to work through all the bureaucracy and glad-handing necessary to establish the zone.)",
								"Now that the zone is established, the group needs transportation and goods. They invest in two caravans, spending 800 gp and gaining a load capacity of 10 units. This leaves the fledging business with 3,700 gp to buy trade goods. They purchase 4 units of durable goods (600 gp), 4 units of textiles (800 gp), and 2 units of spices (2,000 gp) for a total cost of 3,400 gp, leaving them with 300 gp in the group treasury for the future.",
								"The caravans are ready to go, and the group figuratively waves goodbye to them as they depart. Over the next month, the group strikes out on other excursions, but each time the members return to the town from their adventuring, they take a day or two to check on the business, making sure operations are running smoothly and that any unexpected challenges or set-backs are handled. Over the 30 days of the provincial trade run, they devote 6 days toward managing the trading company, enough to gain the +3 Participation Modifier.",
								"At the end of the month, it's time to see what kind of success they garnered from the trading. Because the trade route is at the provincial level, the players use that table to determine what kind of profits or losses they incur for the month. The Provincial Profit table indicates the die roll is {@dice 2d4} + the modifier, which in this case is +3 due to their participation. Each kind of trade good gets its own roll. For the durable goods, the final result is 9 (3 and 3 on the {@dice d4}s plus 3 for the modifier) and, reading across the row marked \"9\" to the column where Durable Goods results are listed, the income shown is 126 percent. They record this value on their Trade Sheet. For textiles, the players roll another 9, resulting in 119 percent return, and the result for spices is only 6 with a 109 percent return.",

Adding the values in the Return column together shows a total of 3,888 gp. Adding the values in the Expense column together shows their expense of 3,400 gp. This means the characters spent 3,400 gp on the trade goods and received 488 gp of net profit for the month, which is not a bad start to their trading enterprise.",

This downtime activity uses the term \"manor,\" but the idea of the \"manor\" should be stretched to include other kinds of resource-producing properties set in different regions and climates.

In the early days of the Southlands, Bastet the cat queen and Gamka the lion-headed titan breathed life into tufts of fur plucked from the goddess's tail and the titan's mane. The power of these two children of the primordial Aurgelmir, the giant whose body became Midgard itself, worked to shape the first catfolk. However, the brief affair soon perished to the old enmity between god and titan. Central to their contentionwas the final form of the catfolk. Bastet desired these new creations to resemble her beloved cats while Gamka pushed for the fierce lions. After a brief but violent quarrel, the two divine beings went their separate ways, each taking some of the new mortals for themselves and shaping them according to their own whims. Some suggest Bastet achieved her revenge by engineering the fall of the titan empire, but others disagree, claiming the Cat Goddess would never be so blatant. For more information about the basteti and nkosi, see the {@footnote {@bold Southlands Player's Guide}|Southlands Player's Guide by Kobold Press is currently not converted for 5eTools.}.",

Many malkins and pantherans also hold this to be true and become devout followers of Bastet. Some families, however, have different stories for their origins. For some malkin families, their legends state the malkin were created by Loki, who was enamored with the natural curiosity and mischievousness of small cats. For some pantheran families, their legends state the pantherans were created by the ancient forests of Midgard as protectors of the natural world, though which forest birthed the first pantherans varies by family. Regardless of the stories, Bastet embraces all catfolk, and Loki's favor is rarely out of reach for those seeking to cause mischief. As for the forests of Midgard, few can understand the wills and powers of these mysterious entities, and even they aren't privy to all the forests' secrets."

Keep in mind, derro are often awed by beings they see as powerful, though each derro defines what they deem as \"powerful.\" Your derro character could view another member of the group as the group's \"witch queen\" (regardless of that character's gender) and follow that character almost zealously. The instability of the derro could also lead your character to choose a different member of the group each day or each week as the current \"witch queen.\"",

This modification grants only the ability to understand and speak the language. If the creation can't normally speak, it still can't speak the new language. This modification can be taken more than once with the creation learning a different language for each modification."

Each time you make an attack roll with this weapon, a piece of ammunition is expended from the magazine. This weapon doesn't need to be reloaded between each attack, provided the magazine has ammunition remaining, allowing you to make multiple attacks with the weapon if you're able to make multiple attacks with the {@action Attack} action. When the ammunition from the magazine is depleted, you can swap out the empty magazine for a full magazine as an action or bonus action. Refilling an empty magazine with ammunition takes 1 minute."
