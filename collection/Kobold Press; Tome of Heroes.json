If you roll the highest possible number on an individual damage die (such as a 6 on a d6 or a 12 on a d12) when you attack with this weapon, you can roll that die again and add the result to the total.

The character adds those results to the current damage total for a final damage total of 26. Since the character's proficiency bonus is +2, the character can't reroll the new 6, ending the gunpowder bursts for that attack. When that character makes another attack with the {@item pistol|ToH}, this process starts anew.",

In the early days of the Southlands, Bastet the cat queen and Gamka the lion-headed titan breathed life into tufts of fur plucked from the goddess's tail and the titan's mane. The power of these two children of the primordial Aurgelmir, the giant whose body became Midgard itself, worked to shape the first catfolk. However, the brief affair soon perished to the old enmity between god and titan. Central to their contentionwas the final form of the catfolk. Bastet desired these new creations to resemble her beloved cats while Gamka pushed for the fierce lions. After a brief but violent quarrel, the two divine beings went their separate ways, each taking some of the new mortals for themselves and shaping them according to their own whims. Some suggest Bastet achieved her revenge by engineering the fall of the titan empire, but others disagree, claiming the Cat Goddess would never be so blatant. For more information about the basteti and nkosi, see the {@footnote {@bold Southlands Player's Guide}|Southlands Player's Guide by Kobold Press is currently not converted for 5eTools.}.",
							"Given the small populations of the malkins and pantherans and their similarities with basteti, most believe they are off-shoots of the basteti, especially because Midgard pantherans never appear leonine. Many malkins and pantherans also hold this to be true and become devout followers of Bastet. Some families, however, have different stories for their origins. For some malkin families, their legends state the malkin were created by Loki, who was enamored with the natural curiosity and mischievousness of small cats. For some pantheran families, their legends state the pantherans were created by the ancient forests of Midgard as protectors of the natural world, though which forest birthed the first pantherans varies by family. Regardless of the stories, Bastet embraces all catfolk, and Loki's favor is rarely out of reach for those seeking to cause mischief. As for the forests of Midgard, few can understand the wills and powers of these mysterious entities, and even they aren't privy to all the forests' secrets."

For adventuring darakhul, those in self-imposed exile, or those who never belonged to a darakhul empire, the quest to master their own hunger, to transcend their role as predators of sentient beings, is as much a part of their journey as the current quest.

No one knows better than the darakhul that they can't overcome their nature unless they confront it.",

Whether it's better to try to blend into the local culture is an open question.

If, for example, a darakhul gets involved in a chase or a battle in a crowded city market, there's a chance a bystander might notice the pallor of undead flesh beneath a flapping cloak or the rictus grin inside a deep hood that's momentarily pushed back. Palace guards inspect supplicants to the Queen more carefully than an innkeeper or a merchant inspects customers. If rumors get around that there are murderers, monsters, or darakhul loose in the city, everyone is more alert.",

Do you fight against your urges daily, seeking to return to your old self? What were your goals before your transformation, and do you still pursue them?

Review the {@table Minor Madnesses|ToH} for examples of playable and flavorful maladies that afflict your character.

Keep in mind, derro are often awed by beings they see as powerful, though each derro defines what they deem as \"powerful.\" Your derro character could view another member of the group as the group's \"witch queen\" (regardless of that character's gender) and follow that character almost zealously. The instability of the derro could also lead your character to choose a different member of the group each day or each week as the current \"witch queen.\"",

These people are called shades. Shades can arise from any living race.",

Shades must breathe, consume food and drink, and require shelter from adverse weather. Despite the functional similarities to a living body, a shade isn't composed of flesh and blood. Their bodies are a memory of who they once were, inhabited and quickened by the presence of their soul. Exhaustion, deprivation, and injury take their toll on a shade's body, disrupting their body's ability to maintain the connection to their soul. Food, drink, and air aren't necessary to nourish their bodies but merely to help them maintain the sense of being a living, breathing creature. Similarly, shades appear to sleep, but they do not require it.",
							"The more injured or exhausted a shade, the less corporeal they appear. The colors of their body wash out to pale, desaturated tones, and light begins to pass through them.

It might seem trivial for a shade's bard companion to compose poems or songs regularly, thus sustaining the shade, but such attempts fail. Memory is the key, and a creator who is in regular close contact with the shade draws more on that contact than on their own memory. A shade's traveling companion painting a portrait of the shade during their travels will never become a {@item memento mori|toh}, but a handmade twine bracelet given by a villager after the shade saved their village might if the shade moves on.

They might grow forgetful, losing track of where they are or what year it is. Their memories might drift together, causing them to see people around them as figures from their past.",

Shades can theoretically live forever, but in practice, the memories that tether them to life can't hold out indefinitely.

Some even hide or dispose of their original remains, sometimes suppressing or deeply denying the act at all, and resume their life with no disruption. Anyone could secretly, sometimes even to themselves, be a shade.",

It's remote and completely beneath the notice of the vampire ruling nobility because a scouting force destroyed it during the conquest. The shades found it not long after and set about building themselves a new life.

No creatures other than those you designate can pass through the mirror or see into the mirror realm.",
				"The realm within the mirror is an exact reflection of the location you left. The temperature is comfortable, and any environmental threats (lava, poisonous gas, or similar) are inert, harmless facsimiles of the real thing. Likewise, magic items reflected in the mirror realm have no magical properties, but those carried into it work normally. Food, drink, and other beneficial items within the mirror realm (reflections of originals in the real world) function as normal, real items; food can be eaten, wine can be drunk, and so on. Only items that were reflected in the mirror at the moment the spell was cast exist inside the mirror realm. Items placed in front of the mirror afterward don't appear in the mirror realm, and creatures never do unless they are allowed in by you. Items found in the mirror realm dissolve into nothingness when they leave it, but the effects of food and drink remain.",

Objects can cross the mirror boundary only while worn or carried by a creature, and spells can't cross it at all. You can'tstand in the mirror realm and shoot arrows or cast spells at targets in the world or vice versa.",

If the original space is larger than this, such as an open field or a forest, the boundary is demarcated with an impenetrable, gray fog.",

You can allow new creatures into the mirror realm (and disallow previous creatures) by recasting the spell within range of the permanent mirror. Casting the spell elsewhere doesn't affect the creation or the existence of a permanent mirror realm; a determined spellcaster could have multiple permanent mirror realms to use as storage spaces, hiding spots, and spy vantages."
