						"Five Nations. Secrets of Sarlona. Most canonical Eberron sourcebooks focus on broad concepts or regions\u2014continents, nations, the Last War. Sharn: City of Towers focuses on the greatest city in Khorvaire. In the wake of Exploring Eberron, I knew I wanted to do something different\u2014to dive deeper into a smaller region, picking an interesting point on the map where a group of adventurers could make a difference, and where they could see a town prosper (or fail!) because of their actions. I wanted to explore stories on the edge of the map instead of at the heart of it. But knowing that I wanted to tell stories on a frontier, the question was which frontier? Because in 998 YK, there are a number of interesting choices. Aundair and the Eldeen Reaches. The shard rush in Q'barra. Darguun. All of these were solid options. But ultimately, I love the nation of Droaam. I love looking at creatures that are traditionally classified as monsters and imagining the nation they could build working together. And so this book explores the region that lies between the established human kingdom of Breland and the new, rising nation of Droaam. The opportunity drawing people here isn't gold or even dragonshards. It's Droaam itself, a young nation that is coming into its own. I knew I wanted to tell a tale that draws on classic western tropes, where you could play a warforged sheriff, a small-town preacher, a retired Sentinel Marshal with skeletons in his past. But I loved that this is a place where the Ranger could be a worg and where the Bard might be a harpy\u2014where the classic fantasy elements of Breland mingle with the monstrous denizens of Droaam.",
						"Quickstone began as an adventure\u2014a starting point for characters that wasn't Sharn or Stormreach. As we explored the story, I realized that I wanted to take it further, exploring the entire region and the stories we could tell there. As it turned out, the road to Quickstone was long and hard, filled with random encounters and unexpected challenges. I appreciate the hard work of everyone who's helped us reach the end of this journey. Wayne Chang kept the project moving forward, with help from Sumeet Vats in the final stretch. Imogen Gingell brought the adventure \"Heart of Stone\" to life, as well as developing subclasses, feats, monsters, and treasures. Luke Volker refined our writing and made sure we were in line with the revised rules in the 2024 version of the fifth edition Player's Handbook, while Sam Sorensen put all the pieces together. A host of artists contributed to the book, and I'm grateful to Carolina Cesario, Matthew Johnson, Julio Azevedo, GAOZ, Vincentius Matthew, Sylverryn, Jonathan Ng, Alexandra Coggon, Olie Bollador, and Eldon Cowgur for giving us a vision of the Western Frontier\u2014and especially to Thomas Bourdon for his amazing cover and to Marco Bernardini for his incredible map of Quickstone. Marco completed this map in 2021, and I'm so happy to finally share it with the world.",
						"But there's another group of people to thank. It's taken a long time to finish the book, but for the last few years I've been running a campaign set in Quickstone for my patrons. Hundreds of people have contributed time and energy toward shaping Quickstone, and many of the NPCs you'll find here are drawn from that campaign. So thanks to everyone who has been a part of Quickstone\u2014and to you for exploring it now. And thanks to my partner Jennifer Ellis for walking from Quickstone to Silver Lake with me.",
						"As always, this book is a vision of Eberron as I run it at my table. You may find details that don't align precisely with previous sourcebooks. It's up to you to decide which version to use\u2014or to use both as inspiration for your own ideas! From the beginning, we wanted Eberron to inspire people to create their own stories. So welcome to the Frontier\u2014I hope you'll make it your own!",

						"When people think about adventures in Eberron, they often think of distant and legendary locations\u2014the jungles of Xen'drik, the dragon-realms of Argonnessen, the hidden lands of Sarlona. Others look to the great cities of Sharn, Korth, or Fairhaven, metropolises teeming with people. But there is adventure to be had in the cracks between the great cities and distant lands. In the wake of the Last War, new nations have broken away from the yoke of Galifar, and this has created a host of unique frontiers and untapped opportunities. West of Breland, a number of different cultures have joined together as the nation of Droaam. The medusas of Cazhaak Draal have opened their stone gates, the tieflings of the Venomous Demesne have emerged from their hidden kingdom, and the infamous Daughters of Sora Kell stand above it all. Breland and the other Thronehold nations have refused to recognize Droaam\u2014and this, in turn, means that Droaam isn't obliged to respect the laws and traditions of the nations of the east. And it further means that the border between Droaam and Breland is largely a theoretical concept. This has left a wide swath of land where no one truly holds sway\u2014where each village must stand ready to defend itself from brigands and raiders, where Brelish and Droaamite may dwell side by side, where Cannith goods can be found alongside the arcane creations of the Venomous Demesne. It's a region filled with ancient ruins, some of which have been shunned for centuries\u2014often with good reason. And it is a region filled with expanding cities and newborn hamlets, where people have come in search of opportunity in spite of the danger. This is the Western Frontier.",
						"All the themes of Eberron\u2014the concepts discussed in Eberron: Rising from the Last War\u2014are in play on the frontier. There is opportunity for pulp adventure, for fighting demon-fueled champions in ancient Dhakaani ruins or racing to stop nefarious cultists from releasing the deadly daelkyr. And there's room for noir intrigue, for schemes driven by petty greed and human weakness. The impact of the Last War can be felt here, as veterans and refugees settle in unclaimed lands and war criminals and deserters from the east hide from justice. But there are other themes that are unique to this time and place. This is an opportunity to explore the shifting balance between Droaam and Breland, to find mysteries in towns too small to show up on any map, to bring justice to places where it's long been forgotten. So strap on your wand and saddle up the tribex\u2014Quickstone awaits.",

								"In the distant past, the lands west of Breland were a vibrant part of the goblin Empire of Dhakaan. The Six Kings monument on the northern edge of the Graywall Mountains commemorates the founding of this empire. At that time, the region was prosperous and fertile, and networks of roads and tunnels connected a host of Dhakaani towns and cities. That golden age was torn down by the daelkyr. The Xoriat Incursion wasn't a single focused invasion. It was a series of waves, each stronger and deadlier than the last. Orlaask, Avassh, and Dyrrn sank their tendrils into the region and spread corruption and chaos. Some of these were straightforward, physical conflicts\u2014hordes of dolgaunts and dolgrims supported by mind flayers and beholders clashing with disciplined Dhakaani legions. Others were more subtle, such as Avassh's creation of rageweed, a swiftly spreading plant whose pollen causes hallucinations and enhances aggression in bugbears and hobgoblins. It's not known with certainty who caused the environmental damage, but historical records show that the region now known as the Barrens was once verdant and fertile. It could be that it was the daelkyr Avassh who drained the life from the soil... or it may be that the Dhakaani themselves devastated the land in a desperate, pyrrhic effort to contain the threat posed by the daelkyr. Ultimately, the Daelkyr were defeated, but the damage was irreparable. The psychic wounds inflicted by the daelkyr festered, and civil war, chaotic upheavals, and lingering aberrations and monstrosities tore the empire apart. Within two centuries, the Barrens were a dusty region of haunted ruins. Bugbears and hobgoblins were nearly eradicated. Goblins remained, but they were soon subjugated by the scavengers and predators that emerged from the shadows\u2014feral gnolls, hungry trolls, cruel minotaurs, and far worse things. And the daelkyr aren't the only deadly powers in this place. There is an overlord bound beneath the Barrens, a force that thrives on brutal tyranny. This Horned King fueled the cruelty of the chibs, petty chieftains engaged in endless feuds. Over time, islands of civilization arose in this sea of chaos... The Venomous Demesne. The Znir Pact. The hidden changelings of Lost. The harpies of the high peaks. But these forces remained isolated and all but unknown to the people of the east, who saw only the violence of the chibs and the monstrosities roaming freely.",
								"With the rise of Galifar, Breland laid claim to all the lands west of Silver Lake. But this was just a word written on a map. Throughout the history of Galifar, there were only a handful of Brelish towns west of the Graywall Mountains. The largest of these was the town of Stubborn, which has since become Graywall; the Church of the Silver Flame established Brightstone Keep, which has since become Grimstone. But between the harsh nature of the land and the chaotic aggression of its inhabitants, the rulers of Galifar never considered it worth the effort to fully subjugate it.",
								"Centuries passed. New civilizations arose in the Barrens; the rise of the medusa city-state of Cazhaak Draal went entirely unnoticed by the people of the east. The region was simply a land of monsters, a place for eager templars to venture on bold quests. The denizens of the region were seen as too chaotic to pose any sort of serious threat to Galifar, and the Barrens had nothing of value. Then came the Last War. Galifar shattered into five nations. And along the edges of Khorvaire new nations seized the opportunity. The Mror dwarves declared independence. The Tairnadal elves and Ghaal'dar goblins laid claim to Valenar and Darguun. And in 986 YK, the Daughters of Sora Kell sacked the city of Stubborn and issued an ultimatum to the survivors. {@i \"Tell your rulers there's a new power in the west,\"} Sora Katra told the people of Stubborn. {@i \"What you've called the Barrens, we now name Droaam. The land beyond the Graywall and below the Byeshk belongs to our people. Withdraw yours quickly and respect our claim; next time, there will be no survivors.\"}",
								"The next decade saw a series of dramatic conflicts between Brelish soldiers under the leadership of Count ir'Blis and Droaamite forces. Breland struck at Turakbar's Fist. Droaamites razed villages around Orcbone. The struggle came to an end with the Mourning. As the nations of Khorvaire came together to craft the Treaty of Thronehold, the Daughters of Sora Kell sought a seat at the table. Their petition was denied. The people of the east wouldn't accept a nation of monsters; they were certain it would collapse within a few years. But in 998 YK, Droaam is stronger than ever... and people know it. The dragonmarked houses smell opportunity. Tharashk has found dragonshards and other valuable resources. Brelish nobles are offering veterans and refugees land in this region, drawing a new wave of settlers.",

The Barrens were once an important part of the Dhakaani empire, and there are fragments of the fallen civilization spread across the region. It's possible to find Dhakaani structures that are still intact, from small watchtowers to fortress cities like Cazhaak Draal or Shaarat Kol. But more often, adventurers will encounter remnants of structures destroyed by war and the passage of time, like the chunk of an ancient wall in the town of Quickstone. Keep in mind that Dhakaani architecture usually involved subterranean structures; what appears to be a devastated ruin could have intact vaults extending deep into the earth. And these in turn could have vile spores of Avassh, gargoyle servants of Orlassk, or other relics of the forces that destroyed Dhakaan. And finally, the Barrens holds a host of more recent ghost towns\u2014villages built by Brelish settlers and abandoned in response to the rise of Droaam, or chib camps abandoned under the new order. The Barrens are vast and largely uncharted.

Do they sympathize with the Grizzlies or the Mourners? How do they feel about the rise of Main Street and the upcoming Kundarak enclave?

										"As a player character becomes wealthy and powerful, they may find some of the stories on the frontier to be less compelling. A 15th level Wizard with a purse full of diamonds won't have much trouble with a band of basic brigands. There are a few ways to handle this. The first is to shift rewards. \"Heart of Stone,\" the adventure included in this book, can carry characters to 5th level. This makes them quite capable by the standards of the Western Frontier. Moving forward, the DM could reduce XP rewards, cutting them by 50-75%; the characters will continue to advance, but slowly. Likewise, they may receive less gold than is typically assigned to the challenges they overcome. The point isn't to penalize the adventurers\u2014it's to give them different rewards. Rather than raw currency, rewards can be favors, improved reputation, useful magic items\u2014whether that's an experimental potion, a Dhakaani adamantine blade, or a golden fiddle from the Merchant of Misthaven\u2014or, potentially, Epic Boons or Supernatural Gifts. Adventurers who shatter Orlassk's cursed altar might receive a Supernatural Gift without explanation; is it a gift from the archfey King Grayfinger, a show of gratitude for cleansing the stone? Or is it the first manifestation of Orlassk's \"blessing\"\u2014which might soon become a curse?",

The point is that, as the economy of the Western Frontier operates at a lower level than Sharn or Fairhaven, the adventurers don't need a lot of gold for it to be significant. Likewise, they should feel that they are gaining useful things because of their victories\u2014but those can be favors or blessings rather than the ability to cast 7th level spells.",
										"This is an option, but it's not the only one. If a DM wants to run a higher level campaign on the Western Frontier, the challenges faced by the adventurers can evolve to match their power. Fiends could manifest through Rhesh Turakbar's Demonglass Warriors. Mordain the Fleshweaver could unleash deadly threats tailored specifically to challenge the adventurers. Orlassk could unleash a Stoneborn Tarrasque. These sorts of threats will certainly shift the tone of the campaign, but there are ways to challenge high-level characters."

A more severe injury could result in the loss of all or part of a limb; remember that Eberron: Rising from the Last War has Prosthetic Limbs! But scars don't have to be physical. A character could have a traumatic reaction to the source of their defeat; going forward, they suffer Disadvantage on ability checks or attack rolls directly related to the person or creature that scarred them. The damage could be to their reputation, as word of the defeat spreads and wherever they go, people bring up the story.

												"The Western Frontier lies between Breland, Droaam, and the Eldeen Reaches. Merchants are always happy to see Brelish coins or Kundarak letters of credit, but they're used to dealing with people from both sides of the road. Droaam has yet to mint currency. Bartering is a common practice in Droaamite daily life. Droaamite miners often trade using small chunks of precious metal or uncut gemstones. Droaamites also gamble and barter with bounty-marked teeth. The Daughters of Sora Kell offer bounties on certain dangerous creatures, paid for by the tooth. A Goblin symbol identifying the animal it's from is carved on each tooth, but most merchants won't accept teeth unless they personally recognize the tooth\u2014so you can't just carve \"wyvern\" on wolf teeth. While the DM could treat bounty-marked teeth as another form of coinage\u2014\"the old goblin offers three displacer beast teeth, worth 10 silver pieces\"\u2014adventurers who kill a dangerous monstrosity might wonder what the bounty is for their teeth. The DM could roll on the Individual Treasure tables in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide to determine the bounty offered for a creature of any CR. However, the tooth currency is based on the value the Daughters have placed on each bounty, and not every creature has a golden mouth. Some dangerous creatures might have a high value, while others are worthless. The bounty is a way to encourage the elimination of threats, and if a creature doesn't threaten the people of Droaam\u2014or is perhaps even an ally\u2014there won't be a bounty on its teeth. The people of the Venomous Demesne have their own forms of currency, including vials of blood charged with arcane energy and shards of crystalized souls; however, most people on the Western Frontier aren't willing to trade goods for a vial of pain-soaked blood."

A typical village might have a single representative of a Dragonmarked House\u2014a Sivis message station, a Jorasco healer, a Vadalis farrier, a Cannith smith\u2014while a larger town may have a few different dragonmarked heirs. Even so, there's a world of difference between the Jorasco Healing House you'll find in Wroat and the Patchery, the tiny clinic run by Daff d'Jorasco in the town of Quickstone. This can have a variety of effects. For one, the selection of goods is always more limited. In Quickstone, the blacksmith, Bel, can make you a Trident if you give her a day or two, but she doesn't have one just sitting on the rack ready for sale. And if you're not dealing with businesses licensed by dragonmarked houses, prices will often vary based on the perceived need and means of the customer. The upside to this is that you can occasionally find goods that aren't available in the standardized shops of the east. At the Patchery, Daff may only have a small supply of Potions of Healing available. But he could have a special potion he's mixed up using a byeshk infusion and a bit of what he's fairly certain was troll blood. He can't be sure what it will do until you drink it, but he thinks it's a potion of Heal. Do you want to buy it and find out? This idea goes even further in the markets of Droaam. Without the standards imposed by the Dragonmarked Houses, there's a lot of potential snake oil on the market. Some things might not work at all (\"It's not my fault! It's your thin human blood!\"); others might have remarkable effects that are more powerful than an adventurer could normally get at the price. Will they take a chance?",
												"A final point is that services may be sparse in the Western Frontier, but the Dragonmarked Houses are taking an interest. The town of Quickstone already has a Gold Dragon Inn, and House Kundarak is working on a vault enclave. Over the course of time, new services will become available, but is this a good thing? Do you actually want a Kundarak enclave in your town?"

Just because they can kill these cultists without consequences, is that the best answer? Ultimately, it's up to the DM to decide whether to encourage ruthless justice or to explore the broader consequences. When the adventurers fight a stone cult, if they do manage to keep the cultists alive and sever their ties to the cult rather than just killing them... maybe the family of a cultist invites them over for dinner in the next session. Maybe a cultist gives them an uncommon magic item\u2014a family heirloom\u2014in thanks for their freedom. Conversely, if adventurers do ruthlessly slay their enemies, they may see the consequences of Droaamite justice, as the friends or kin of their victims hunt them down, spread stories about them, or otherwise make life difficult. One such consequence is that an adventurer could be challenged to a duel. Overall, most people on the Western Frontier support dueling if the cause is seen as justified. If a wandslinger comes to town and declares that an adventurer killed his brother in a cowardly fashion and that the adventurer is currently wearing the brother's amulet, stolen from his corpse\u2014if the adventurer refuses to duel or cheats to win, they could quickly acquire an infamous reputation.

The idea isn't that a character with high Hit Points can simply laugh as someone stabs them over and over; it's that as long as they have Hit Points, they can avoid a lethal blow. Standard combat reflects the idea that combatants are dodging, parrying, and evading attacks even as they are losing Hit Points. People can and do fight challenges in the street using the normal rules of combat, which means they're dodging and moving and getting hit multiple times before they fall. But an arcane duel is an entirely different form of combat. It's about raw courage, speed, and skill: the courage to stand your ground, the speed to strike first, and the skill to land your spell. There's no dodging in a duel; you need to look your rival in the eye as you strike them down. Because of this, an arcane duel only involves a single attack from each combatant\u2014and that single blast can be deadly, regardless of how many Hit Points you possess.",

										"Dragonmarked houses and others are heading to the Western Frontier. House Orien is extending the lightning rail toward Graywall. But this is no story of Brelish colonialism. Breland isn't expanding across this frontier\u2014it's being driven away from it. Throughout the history of Galifar, the people of the Barrens were divided. The medusas of Cazhaak Draal, the changelings of Lost, and the tieflings of the Venomous Demesne were isolated city-states, which avoided contact both with Breland and with one another. These cultures were all but unknown in the east, so the dominant impression of the region was of the chaotic chib culture. The Daughters of Sora Kell brought these diverse factions together. Force was a factor in the creation of Droaam, and fear of Maenya's Fist still plays an important role in keeping the old chibs in line. But the common depiction of Droaamites as squalid villages of goblins dominated by slow-witted ogres is driven by ignorance and Brelish propaganda. Under the Daughters of Sora Kell, each of the cultures of the region is a thread of a growing tapestry. New villages and towns are rising up from the Barrens, their construction driven by ogre strength, goblin enthusiasm, and the brilliant architects and masons of Cazhaak Draal. Magewrights from the Venomous Demesne are implementing an arcane infrastructure that could in time outshine the everyday amenities of the Five Nations. Droaam is a very young nation, still finding its footing and establishing traditions. But it is growing stronger every day, and it's only a matter of time until its great cities\u2014like Graywall and the Great Crag\u2014rival Wroat and Fairhaven. And it is this that is drawing the influx of travel and trade from the east; the glimpse of opportunities as Droaam grows and prospers.",
										"With that said, it is largely in the great cities\u2014such as Graywall, Vralkek, Cazhaak Draal\u2014that this renaissance is occurring. The Droaamites who dwell on the Western Frontier are remnants of the old system of chib rule, where a family of ogres or minotaurs would dominate a community of goblins and kobolds. Under the leadership of the Daughters, Droaamite workers are assured food, shelter, and security. Today, the chibs are expected to protect their people, not to oppress them; a modern chib serves as both mayor and sheriff. The Daughters are likewise encouraging the spread of Droaamite species into all communities. Though goblins may make up the majority of a village's population, there could be a harpy songbird in the inn, a tiefling magewright teaching a class of kobold sorcerers, and the old ogre chib may have been replaced by a wise medusa. So, at first glance, a Droaamite village in the Barrens might seem primitive... but look closer, and you'll see a well-fed population, working together to improve the conditions of the community. But again, this system is new and the idea of Droaam is still finding its footing along the border. The old chib system still lingers, especially in the villages around Turakbar's Fist; Rhesh Turakbar and his reavers still enforce order with force and fear.",
										"When dealing with a Droaamite community\u2014or envisioning the background of an adventurer from Droaam\u2014keep these things in mind. Droaam has only existed in its current form for a decade, and any villages along the Border Road will be younger than that. Because of this, a village will have been built for a reason\u2014taking advantage of water, a manifest zone, mineral deposits identified by House Tharashk, or something else that makes the spot worth building on. And more so than in the typical Brelish village, Droaamties often have a sense of hope; they are working together, and their nation is on the rise. The exception to this is in the vicinity of Turakbar's Fist. Here the villages are older, as Turakbar's Fist has dominated the region since before the rise of Galifar. And many of those villages are ruled by tyrannical chibs and weighed down by despair.",
										"Droaam has a few institutions that play a vital role in the nation, and whose agents can be encountered on the frontier.",
										"{@b {@i Katra's Voice}} is the diplomatic arm of Droaam, and Voices are envoys, entertainers, diplomats, and mediators. Their task is to maintain morale and lines of communication, and to help resolve disputes before they get out of hand. Agents of Katra's Voice are usually changelings, medusas, tieflings, or harpies. Many highlight their role as entertainers, sharing stories with the common folk and painting tales of the bright future that lies ahead. Others focus more on mediation, especially if there is unrest between the local chib and the inhabitants of the community. Katra's Voice also includes wandering magistrates, who typically travel with two soldiers of Maenya's Fist. The current fashion is for medusas to serve as magistrates; if they consider a plaintiff's complaint to be frivolous, they petrify them. However, there are a few changeling magistrates with exceptional telepathic abilities who excel at unraveling difficult situations.",
										"{@b {@i Maenya's Fist}} is the personal army of Sora Maenya, which acts to defend the nation and to enforce the rule of the Daughters when Katra's Voice fails to resolve an issue. The foundation of the Fist is a corps of armored war trolls and skullcrusher ogres that are fanatically devoted to Sora Maenya; a single war troll can scatter a band of insubordinate ogres. However, over the last decade, the Fist has expanded to include a broader range of forces, including centaur cavalry, air support from gargoyles and harpies, rangers and scouts drawn from the Dark Pack, and more. As a general rule, warlords are expected to use their own forces to maintain order in their domains; near Turakbar's Fist adventurers are more likely to encounter a band of minotaurs than a squad of Maenya's Fist. Fists are either dispatched directly by Sora Maenya to deal with known threats, or found in the company of a Voice or an Eye whose mission they are supporting. Consider them Droaam's answer to the Westwind Riders\u2014or in the case of a large company of Maenya's Fist, the equivalent of Breland bringing Argonth into play.",
										"{@b {@i Teraza's Eye}} gathers information for the Daughters, and its members serve as sages, inquisitives, and chroniclers. Droaam is a new nation, and the Daughters need to know if their experiment is working. Often, Eyes simply travel and observe, gathering information without interfering; if they uncover dangerous situations, they will call on the Voice or the Fist. However, they can be tasked to investigate intriguing mysteries\u2014typically supernatural threats, as diplomatic or judicial matters will be handled by Katra's Eyes.",
										"{@b {@i The Znir Pact}} is another force adventurers on the Western Frontier will come to know. These gnolls are mercenary soldiers. Half of the Pact has been hired by the Daughters to serve as general peacekeepers, supplementing the forces of the local warlord and dealing with troubles that don't require the full power of Maenya's Fist. Znir gnolls can also be found serving a local warlord. So Znir patrols can be found on the Border Road or on the old roads, but they will generally ignore adventurers unless there is a threat that needs to be dealt with.",
										"So, new villages are springing up along the Border Road. Graywall is expanding. The lightning rail is heading west. And a squad of Maenya's war trolls showing up should be legitimately frightening. {@i Droaam is on the rise.}",

												"One of the most distinctive elements of an adventure on the Western Frontier is the presence of Droaamite species traditionally thought of as monsters, whether as adventurers or as NPCs. Due to the efforts of House Tharashk, Droaamites are starting to appear in cities across the Five Nations. But on the Western Frontier, they are a part of everyday life. Travel on the Border Road, and you'll run into Znir patrols and wandering worgs. Stop in a village west of the road, and you'll find a harpy singing in the tavern, delighting a crowd of goblins and kobolds. Communities east of the road usually have a Brelish majority, but you may still find an ogre unloading crates from the Thunder Coach, a gargoyle watching from a roof, or a family of goblins starting a new life. This section provides a closer look at the species that are presented as character options in chapter 4, along with an overview of many other denizens of Droaam. Whether creating characters for a Western Frontier campaign or choosing NPCs for a scene, keep these ideas in mind.",

The wind carried her whispers through the stone, and the gargoyles perched on the walls and crouching in the corridors of the keep turned on the templars.",

And a few follow their own paths, driven by curiosity or by the bonds they've formed with places or people.

																"Evidence suggests that Dhakaani stoneworkers in the region became obsessed with these \"guardian statues\" in the decades leading up to the first open conflict with daelkyr forces... and it was during that battle that the daelkyr Orlassk breathed life into the countless guardians. Orlassk never controlled the gargoyles directly, but they came into existence with an instinctive revulsion for organic life, a reaction much like most humans have when encountering mold or viruses. Creatures of flesh are fundamentally repulsive, rotting monstrosities filled with disgusting fluids and leaking foul excrement. The first gargoyles lashed out against the dar surrounding them, and claimed the fortresses they had once guarded as their own. But they soon realized that they were vastly outnumbered by the creatures of flesh. Beyond this, they didn't need anything from the world beyond their walls. They didn't need food or other supplies. So they remained at their posts, and eventually fell into a deep torpor. In this state, their spark of life was so weak that they couldn't even be sensed by {@spell Detect Good and Evil|XPHB}, which is how the templars of Brightstone Keep failed to recognize them for what they were. But they were still aware of their surroundings on a deep level. When Katra spoke to the gargoyles of Brightstone, each heard something different, the perfect story to pull them from their slumber. Some heard tales of the wonders waiting to be seen out in the world. For others, she painted pictures of the excitement to be found in battle, or the satisfaction to be found in protecting someone one cares about. Her magic roused them, but not all the stone host joined the hag. A small force of gargoyles had heard the songs and teachings of the Silver Flame even while they slept, and found the vision of the Flame to be compelling. These gargoyles helped a group of friars escape and return to Flamekeep, where they have embraced the Silver Flame and fight alongside the templars to this day; these gargoyles are now known as the {@i wingwyrds}.",
																"Brightstone Keep wasn't the only place where Sora Katra woke slumbering gargoyles. There were a handful of other shunned keeps along the edge of the Byeshk Mountains, and Katra roused the gargoyles in each. And there was one place where some gargoyles were already awake: Cazhaak Draal, the city at the heart of the Stonelands. When the medusas laid claim to the city, their queen spoke to the slumbering gargoyles. Some chose to remain in their torpor, but a handful awoke and were eventually convinced to work with the medusas. It was through this alliance that the gargoyles learned how to reproduce, as described later in this article. Medusa and gargoyle alike chose to remain isolated from the warlike denizens of the Barrens, and the gargoyles of Cazhaak Draal rarely left the fortress city. But the Cazhaak gargoyles have been awake for over a century; they are more used to the world and to working side by side with organic creatures, and some have adopted the Cazhaak faith. When the Daughters of Sora Kell established a new province centered on the newly-christened Grimstone Keep and appointed Cairngorm to serve as warlord and guardian of the province, many of the gargoyles of Cazhaak Draal flocked to their new prince.",
																"In creating a gargoyle, consider which of these categories you fall into. Did you slumber in the ruins for thousands of years? Did you live alongside the medusas of Cazhaak Draal? Are you a newborn, hewn in the gravel pits of Cazhaak Draal and still crafting your final form? Or are you a gargoyle with no connections to Droaam whatsoever... a statue infused with life elsewhere in the world?"

																"Gargoyles are elemental creatures, and their physiology defies all natural laws. When a gargoyle stands still, it is indistinguishable from a stone statue. They are made of light, inanimate stone... And yet, when they choose to move, they can. This same illogic applies to their wings. Gargoyle wings can take many forms, but the vast majority couldn't possibly keep a gargoyle aloft, and yet somehow they fly. Some scholars believe the gargoyles fly through an instinctive manipulation of elemental air, but nothing has been proven. With that said, the fact that gargoyles have the elemental type doesn't mean that they have any planar connection or any bond to other elemental creatures. They are elementals because they are creatures of animate stone.",
																"The majority of gargoyles follow the model of the Dhakaani guardian statue\u2014the classic horned, bat-winged humanoid. However, this is only due to the fact that these statues were produced in mass quantities. Firstly, the Dhakaani gargoyles weren't stamped out of a mold. The horned, winged design is common, but some gargoyles have ram's horns, tribex horns, or no horns at all. Likewise, gargoyle wings can be long or ridiculously small, stone carved in the likeness of leather or feathers. Someone exceptionally versed in the history of Dhakaan could potentially identify the ruin a sleeper gargoyle comes from based on its artistic design. And yet, when Orlassk animated the statues of the Barrens, it affected more than just the guardians. There are wingless gargoyles carved in the shape of ancient Dhakaani heroes. The Dhakaani were especially infuriated by this mockery of their champions and made an extra effort to destroy these creatures, but there are still a few scattered among the host of Grimstone. In creating a gargoyle character, consider how your appearance reflects your choice of class. Unlike warforged, gargoyles weren't built for a specific purpose; the Dhakaani artisans had no idea their creations would come to life. But the material used or design of a gargoyle could influence its capability. A gargoyle Druid could be carved from densewood instead of stone, while a gargoyle Sorcerer could have dragonshards or slivers of demonglass incorporated into its stone body.",
																"This highlights the fact that not all gargoyles have wings. The classic Dhakaani guardian\u2014represented by the gargoyle stat block in the Monster Manual\u2014has wings and claws, and is formed from dense stone. But a gargoyle with the shape of a bugbear hero or a Cazhaak newborn may be made from softer stone and lack both claws and wings. These traits are reflected by the feats Wings of Stone and Hewn for Battle (see chapter 4). If your gargoyle character begins at a high level, you may start with these traits. If you're playing a 1st level gargoyle character, you have yet to assume your final form, or perhaps you've simply chosen not to add wings to your design.",
																"This choice is reflected in the way gargoyles reproduce and grow. Gargoyles have no functional reproductive organs. To reproduce, two or more gargoyles work together to carve an egg. During this ritual, they infuse the egg with a fraction of their own lifeforce. The egg is buried in a pit of gravel or stone shards. Over time, it absorbs the surrounding chunks of rock, instinctively assimilating these and reshaping them to build its own body. The appearance of a newborn gargoyle usually reflects a blending of its parents, but this is a foundation. Gargoyles don't need to eat, but a growing gargoyle will consume chunks of stone that will be added to its mass. As it continues to grow, its appearance will shift to match its own evolving self-image."

																		"{@b Guardians} are driven by love of a person, place, or thing; their lives revolve around defending their wards. Guardians are typically stationary; these are the traditional gargoyles found on fortress walls, remaining perfectly still until something threatens their charge. However, a guardian could form an attachment to another character or even to an idea, like the wingwyrds of the Silver Flame. When playing a guardian gargoyle, consider: what drove your choice of ward? Could anything break this devotion?",
																		"{@b Thinkers} are rarely encountered, because even more than guardians, they often have no reason to move. A thinker enjoys contemplating weighty concepts. This could be religion, philosophy, arcane science, or any other topic. As a gargoyle thinker, you are likely adventuring to gain access to new sources of information related to the topic that interests you. But whenever there is no need to move, you may fall into a still reverie; during downtime, you could spend days without moving, as you consider the information you've gained."

																"Most gargoyles have little interest in clothing or material possessions. There's very little that they need. However, one of the greatest challenges for a gargoyle is boredom. Rather than gold, gargoyles often want to be paid in stories, songs, or jokes; they then use these as social currency in dealings with other gargoyles. Most gargoyles are tone-deaf and struggle to master musical pursuits, but the rare gargoyle bards and entertainers are held in high regard."

														"The first gnolls were born in the Age of Demons, a product of the endless war between Rak Tulkhesh and the Wild Heart. Even after the overlords were bound, their fiendish influence drove gnolls to engage in vicious acts of brutality. For countless generations, gnolls fought trolls, ogres, other gnolls, and any other creatures they could find, seeking blood for their hungry idols. But in time, leaders arose who urged their clans to resist the call of endless war. They dragged their idols to the place now known as Znir (\"Stone\") and shattered them. Though they might be many clans, from this day forward, they would be one pack. They would allow no one\u2014not chib, god, or demon\u2014to hold dominion over them. This was easier said than done. Fighting the fiendish influence within was challenging enough, but the Barrens were a chaotic tapestry of battling forces. The leaders of the newly forged Znir Pact had no desire to rule over other creatures, but even holding territory could invite attack. And so they developed the path that has carried them forward to this day: the road of the mercenary. The gnolls would claim no territory beyond the lands around Znir. They would fight for any who would pay a fair price. But if anyone sought to enslave a gnoll, or to strike against Znir itself, they would face the wrath of all the united clans. This was a lesson that had to be taught many times, but after a century or so, the point was made. To those who paid them, the gnolls were as reliable as stone. Those who betrayed them or who picked a fight would fall before the might of the full Pact. They have followed this path ever since. One could look at the Pact and say that they serve many masters.

																"The Znir gnolls include a dozen different clans, each of which holds distinct traditions. Once, the clans were devoted to different faces of the overlords, but when they shattered their statues, each clan chose one of the moons. All gnolls skillfully hunt and fight, but the Barrakas are known to be the finest trackers of the Pact; the Aryth, the deadliest archers; the Olarune, the strongest warriors and most forceful in the vanguard. Typically, mercenary units are composed of gnolls of a single clan, assigned based on the nature of the task that lies ahead, and contracts are usually negotiated for a period based on the cycles of the clan's moon. The clans maintain distinct territories within the Znir region, but all gnolls are welcome around the hearth of any clan; the Znir take pains to crush any tension that arises between the clans. Shamans and leaders from each clan maintain a council at the Znir, around the broken idols. Here they mediate disputes, assign contracts to clans, and allocate funds and equipment. The Eyre clan has honed their skills as smiths and tanners, and they craft much of the equipment used by the Znir gnolls\u2014though there is still a strong tradition of scavenging among the Znir, and warriors often claim trophies from fallen foes.",
																"The Znir defied the overlords when they shattered their statues, but there's still a spark of a fiend in the blood of each gnoll. Young gnolls learn how to resist this influence\u2014to channel the strength of the fiend without giving it power over them. For most gnolls, this is a matter of discipline; Znir gnolls are known for remaining calm in the face of provocation, and having learned to fight their own demons, they aren't easily manipulated by mortals. However, some gnolls learn to draw on their unnatural heritage and to channel this power in useful ways. Znir gnolls have their own equivalents of rangers and barbarians; the ranger's primal magic draws on the Wild Heart, while the barbarian channels the fury of the Rage of War. Znir shamans are similar to warlocks, typically following the path of the Fiend. However, in all of these examples, the Znir don't serve the dark power. Rather, they can be seen as stealing their strength from it; learning to draw on it without giving anything in return. In their determination not to let fiendish forces hold dominion over their people, the Znir gnolls have also developed their own techniques for fighting supernatural threats. Champions trained to face fiends and undead are known as hwyri\u2014Gnoll for \"warden\"\u2014and wield powers similar to those of paladins in other lands. However, hwyri don't worship any divine power. Their abilities come from training and understanding of the demon within; they aren't crusaders, they're mercenary demon hunters. Most hwyri come from the Vult clan, and in a land that shuns the Silver Flame, these gnolls can be the best hope for people facing fiendish threats."

In addition to those who serve through House Tharashk or Daask, a number of Znir have been sent east to study the Five Nations, gathering knowledge of its people and customs so the Znir council can determine how to engage with the wider world.

While these are common traits, the fiendish heritage of the gnoll sometimes manifests itself in its appearance.

When stealth isn't necessary, the Znir are often quite vocal in battle; they generally coordinate actions and confirm positions with short bursts in Gnoll. Each Znir gnoll has a whoop, a unique call it uses as a sort of verbal signature; while these are extremely short, they convey both personal identity and clan loyalty. These are used to coordinate in the field, and it's common for a gnoll to whoop when entering a friendly location, as a simple way of identifying itself and giving allies an opportunity to respond. Beyond this, body language and posture\u2014usually slumped\u2014are an important part of gnoll communication; for example, when a gnoll feels threatened or angry, its thick crest of fur down the spine rises.

A harpy's voice is an outlet for all the passion they feel, and singing is a joyous release. The same is true of motion; for a harpy, soaring through the air isn't just a way to get from one point to another, it is a dance with the currents and the wind. Throughout most of the history of Galifar, harpies remained on their mountain peaks. Now they have descended to work with Droaam and Tharashk, and the harpy's song plays a vital role in holding the new nation together.",

The sage Dorius Alyre ir'Korran wrote {@i \"Taking glee in suffering and death, the sadistic harpy is always on the hunt for prey. Its sweet song has lured countless adventurers to their deaths, drawing them in close for the harpy to kill and then consume.\"} They were said to be children of the Fury and the Shadow set on Eberron to torment innocents and drive people to madness; the name harpy was a pejorative term. Scholars can point to historical examples of explorers drawn into chasms and other hazards. However, in many of these cases, the luring harpy wasn't even aware of the adventurers doomed by her voice. She sought only to sing, to express her joy or her sorrow\u2014and those who heard her wanted nothing more than to hear her better, ignoring all dangers as they pursued the haunting song. Most harpies take no glee in suffering or death, but they cannot help the impact their voices have on the people around them. This is why the harpies have long dwelt in the highest mountains\u2014to avoid harming innocents, to live in a space where they can dance with the wind and sing with full throat.",

They carve roosts into cliff faces with the power of their songs, and have felt no need to build cities or raise monuments; in their isolation, they don't need walls to defend themselves from enemies. Culturally, the Byeshk harpies are split into flights, and within flights they are further split into communities known as choirs. Flights are defined by traditions and by their songs; much like the Phiarlan elves, certain songs are treasures of a flight, heirlooms passed down to a single chosen singer.",
																"A decade ago, Sora Katra came to the high peaks and spoke to the elder voices of each flight. She painted a picture of a nation united, of the scattered creatures of the Barrens singing one song, and she asked the elders to descend and make this vision real. Harpies are passionate, and the leaders of the flights were passionate in their views. Four flights\u2014the Carrion Callers, the Last Dirge, the Rotwings, and the Stormsingers\u2014embraced Katra's vision, choosing to leave their mountain homes behind and lead their entire flights behind. Others refused. Some had no desire to leave their high mountains. Others doubted Katra's ability to achieve her dreams or questioned her motives. Callain of the Bloody Word said that the people of the world weren't meant to sing with one voice. The harpies of the Haunting Song took this further, swearing to use their voices to break Katra's vision. This led to the Carrion Callers and Stormsingers joining their voices together to break the Haunting Song. Katra chose to leave the other six dissenting flights in peace. They do not harm Droaam in their high peaks, but they take little part in it. While down below, the harpies of the four flights that are bound to the Daughters have spread across the realm. Harpy song is the mortar that binds the nation together. Songbirds rouse people's spirits at the start of a work day, and soothe them when work is done. Harpies inspire and delight; they can give hope to those who doubt, and end conflicts with a peaceful word. And when it comes to war, they can use their voices as weapons. Most harpies take no glee in suffering and death\u2014but in the first attack on Orcbone, harpy songs had defenders flinging themselves off the walls of the fortress to reach the source of the song. And the harpies serving with Daask have learned that a lure can be a devastating weapon in a city formed from bridges and towers..."

Whether singing goblins to sleep in a grist mill or carrying messages in Sharn, harpies embrace life with absolute zeal. But they hate just as strongly as they love. And little is more terrifying than a harpy roused to anger.",

They don't care what others believe, and will use the name of the Fury when speaking Common as it's the name others know. Each flight has its own story of the Song. The Stormsingers say that the Fury and the Devourer are one and the same, that the Song shapes the storm even as she drives the currents of the heart. The Last Dirge believes that the Song began at the first moment of creation, and that when it reaches its end the world will fade away. Regardless of belief, harpies feel the power of the Song flowing through them when they sing. However, it is power that must be mastered. The legendary lure isn't something all harpies can do; it is an art, and among the harpies those who can perform this are called sirens. But all harpies have power. The most basic gift that all harpies possess is the power to cast {@spell Friends}\u2014shifting emotions with a word. All harpies have access to a particular set of effects\u2014{@spell Charm Person|XPHB|Charm}, {@spell Suggestion|XPHB}. But beyond the abilities granted by the Harpy species, many class abilities can be linked to voice. It's easy to see how a harpy Bard can tie her magic to her song, but a harpy Cleric will sing her prayers; a harpy Druid channels the power of nature with his voice; and a harpy Warlock could depict her {@spell Eldritch Blast|XPHB} as sharp words that strike with physical force. Rangers are common among the Byeshk harpies. Archery is a useful art for flying hunters, and Ranger magic can likewise be tied to song; the {@spell Hunter's Mark|XPHB} of a Byeshk Ranger is sung as a curse."

From a distance, they can be mistaken for humans. Up close, the differences become clear. Medusas blend aspects of mammal and reptile; some medusa bloodlines have scaled skin, while others appear to be carved from stone. Culturally, Cazhaak medusas tend to present themselves as calm and confident, cool as stone. This reflects both the weight of their power and the confidence it gives them; to a medusa, all other creatures are fragile, and a medusa must take care not to break them. Beyond this, the Cazhaak faith is strong among the medusas and there is a serenity that comes from being one of the Shadow's chosen people. Many Cazhaak medusas are asexual; they value companionship and love, but aren't strongly influenced by sexual desire. However, not all medusas share these characteristics! There are medusas who embrace the passions of the Fury, and those who feel no devotion to the Cazhaak Six and follow different paths. Cazhaak medusas can live up to 250 years; they rarely show the effects of aging until the very end, and even then it's common for respected elders to be petrified and preserved in Cazhaak Draal.

The Shadow recognized their potential and ambition and gave them the power to break their chains; after an exodus that led them through many strange demiplanes, they finally reached the shelter of Cazhaak Draal. While the medusas thank the Shadow for their gifts, other scholars feel that this story shows that the medusas were created by the daelkyr Orlassk, and rebelled against their creator. Whether their gifts flow from the Shadow or from the daelkyr, medusas have an affinity for stone and for other creatures that possess the power of petrification. This isn't a primal bond like that of a druid or a Lorghalan gnome; it's in many ways a deeply unnatural connection, a reflection of the fact that, for a medusa, the line between flesh and stone is flexible. Most medusas say that they can hear stone whispering in its sleep; others say that it sings to them. Medusas who have an especially strong affinity for the stone can master a number of supernatural powers, from being able to mold and shape stone to locating veins of minerals and ore by listening to the songs.",

Ohr Kaluun was a harsh land, and the power of the tiefling lords came from old pacts with malefic forces; they were more than willing to walk the road of painful sacrifice to achieve their goals.",

She spoke with the Venom Lords and told them of their futures. None know just what she said, but the next day the artificers of the Maze of Making were ordered to craft a gate that would allow passage to the world beyond the wards. Today, humans and tieflings of the Venomous Demesne can be found across Droaam. Human magewrights are helping to develop the arcane infrastructure of the new nation, while the noble tieflings bring greater powers to bear. Some tieflings see the world beyond the wards as a miserable backwater, hopelessly primitive. But others take real pleasure in helping to build something new, in exploring lands unbounded by wards, in walking beneath the sun and finding new paths to power that don't carry the burdens of the Demesne.",

Instead, they can use any of the Fiendish Legacies presented in the Player's Handbook\u2014Abyssal, Chthonic, or Infernal. These are hereditary traits reflecting the experiments and pacts of their ancestors; the noble families of the Demesne are tied to specific legacies.",

The maze maintains relationships with a number of powerful entities and holds a menagerie of minor spirits bound. Its archives contain records of all pacts and entities dealt with in the past. The Maze of Promises also deals with extraplanar travel and communication. It has long been the largest and most powerful of the four mazes, in part because diplomacy and intrigue are vital parts of its function. It is located within a manifest zone tied to Daanvi, and Daanvian fiends are some of the strongest patrons of the Demesne. While petitioners learn to bind and banish fey, pacts with fey are discouraged; an adventurer with ties to an archfey may have defied their family's traditions.",

Some adepts of Faith are capable of believing anything they put their minds to, while others use potions or other techniques to temporarily enter a state of devotion.

While certain classes are obviously associated with particular mazes, concepts can be reskinned to fit the theme of a particular maze. For example, a Demesne Bard who casts magic due to their knowledge of arcane science would come from the Maze of Mysteries, and might be determined to unlock greater mystical secrets. But a Bard could come from the Maze of Promises, emphasizing their reliance on their charisma, and presenting their spellcasting as the product of bargains made with a host of minor spirits. A Demesne Zealot Barbarian could be a product of the Maze of Faith, driven by ecstatic trances; or they could be from the Maze of Promises, drawing their rage from a lesser fiend bound to their flesh.",

														"The civilization of the Venomous Demesne possesses a level of arcane science beyond that of the Five Nations. Overall, spell effects of up to 5th level can be seen at work in daily life and effects of up to 7th level can be encountered; the Maze of Making can reliably produce Rare, Very Rare, and even Legendary items. Teleportation and extradimensional spaces are incorporated into transit and housing. Casual illusions are used for entertainment and practical purposes. While the Maze of Mysteries is familiar with necromancy, the use of undead is quite rare in the Demesne... not because of any squeamishness, but simply because the traditions of the Demesne have other uses for the resources involved. Because all magic comes with a price. In the wider world, Eberron dragonshards are used to fuel arcane industry. But the Venomous Demesne was cut off from the outside world for over a thousand years; they had to find other sources of energy. The lords of Ohr Kaluun had long dealt with malefic powers and beyond that, the Demesne needed to limit its population. This led to the development of techniques that draw on the living for power. Two common currencies of the Demesne are {@b pain} and {@b time}\u2014each of which is transmitted through the medium of blood, drawn out in drops or carried in vials. Pain involves the immediate experience of pain, and is measured in loss of Hit Points. Time draws on the life force of the subject, providing a far greater yield than temporary pain, but resulting in a permanent reduction of an individual's maximum Hit Points. There are many other forms of currency, depending on the needs of the project and what the subject has to offer. Heartfelt tears have power. True and dangerous secrets can be useful. But the greatest power is the soul itself. There is a vast engine beneath the Maze of Promises that catches the souls of all who die within the wards of the Demesne. Souls with value may be set aside and given to the Maze of Faith for the possibility of resurrection. The rest are drawn into the great engine and distilled into crystal shards, which are capable of fueling magic just like an Eberron dragonshard.",
														"This is the world a Demesne tiefling is used to\u2014a life in which you might pay for a meal with a minute of your life or purchase a gift with a sliver of your father's soul. It is a world of wonders, in which the gods themselves are seen as tools to be used. But it is a harsh life, and there are many scions of the Demesne who take some joy in leaving their home behind.",
														"On a practical level, the cost of magic is something that only affects player characters in a cosmetic fashion. There is no cost to casting a cantrip, unless the adventurer wants to say that they jab their palm with a needle to trigger a jolt of pain. The soul- shards of the Demesne function just like Eberron dragonshards; they can be used in place of other costly components. So a Demesne eremite can use a soul- shard to cast Divination instead of burning incense... but a Demesne Wizard doesn't need to burn a fragment of a soul to cast {@spell Magic Missile|XPHB}. Like dragonshards in the wider world, it is the fuel of industry more than it is used by the typical adventurer. However, this is a key element in the fact that, as powerful and wondrous as the Demesne is, it lacks House Cannith's capabilities for mass production. The Maze of Making can produce Legendary magic items\u2014but it can't produce them quickly or in vast quantities."

The society of the Demesne is loosely feudal, and humans begin their lives as vassals of a noble family. Those that display sufficient skill can earn positions of authority within one of the Mazes. The humans of the Demesne can be artisans and merchants as well as menial laborers, but even a successful family of merchants are vassals to a Tiefling family. In addition, justice in the Demesne is exceptionally harsh when dealing with humans; in a society where blood, pain, bone dust, and souls are the fuel of the magical economy, any crime can carry a death sentence.

They are a unique canid species, distinct from wolves and dogs. The Dhakaani worked closely with worgs, and because of this, small populations of worgs can be found across Khorvaire in places where the Dhakaani had strongholds.

It is a hypernatural environment, like some Lamannian manifest zones; it is impossible to tame the Wood or to establish outposts within it; any structures will be overcome by accelerated growth and decay. This is the birthplace of the worgs. Despite its traits, it is not tied to Lamannia. It doesn't look outwards; the Wood watches what lies within. There is a vast pit in the center of the Watching Wood, surrounded by rotting vegetation and sludgy soil. The Worgs call this Nuushka, the Wound. They say it is a wound inflicted on the First Mother at the dawn of creation\u2014an injury inflicted on Eberron by Khyber's claws. The hypernatural traits of the Watching Wood are a response to the Wound. The fiends and foul things that emerge from the Wound are torn apart by the denizens of the Wood, never reaching the world beyond. Because of this, the Watching Wood is home to a vast array of monstrosities and beasts, both dire and horrid. It's worth noting that these monstrosities may seem monstrous to humans\u2014but they are children of Eberron, distinct from aberrations. And it is the hypernatural power of Eberron that resisted both the corruption of Avassh and the force that shaped the Barrens.",

Their packs are united by common traditions and an instinctive bond to contain the threat of the Wound, but there are a number of unique subcultures\u2014not unlike the Lhazaar Principalities. The Stone Fangs are the fiercest warriors of the inner woods. The worgs of The Menagerie have developed a shapeshifting tradition that mirrors the druidic Circle of the Moon. The Marrowbound turn the power of the Wound against its spawn, pursuing a warlock path. But these packs dwell in the deep woods, and most have never seen or been seen by humanoids. It is the worgs of the outermost woods that interact with outsiders. In the past, they have been known as the Calador, loosely translated as the Uncaged or the Restless. It is the Calador who left the wood to work with the Dhakaani. But a century ago, the elf werewolf Zaeurl came to the Watching Wood, leading an exodus of lycanthropes from Aundair and the Eldeen Reaches. Zaeurl forged an alliance between her refugees, the Calador worgs, and other sentient predators of the outer woods. Together they became the Ghaal'kechan\u2014the Great Pack. Where the Calador had previously kept to the woods and kept others out of it, under Zaeurl's leadership they began to interact with the humanoids on the edge of their domain, forming ties with the gnolls of the Znir Pact and the changelings of Lost.

To the west, the changelings of Droaam come from the nomadic city of Lost, a hidden community that is both disguised and in constant motion. Those changelings that leave Lost are often part of Katra's Voice, moving among the people of Droaam as mediators or entertainers; in this role, they usually walk openly as changelings, often using their shape-shifting abilities aesthetically to add colors and patterns to their skin. Others gather information as part of Teraza's Eye, and these changelings typically use their gifts to blend in and move unnoticed.",

Skindancing is an artistic tradition developed in Lost, which blends motion and transformation; a Changeling Bard of the College of Dance could be a master of this art. The denizens of Lost also hone their innate telepathic powers, and this would be a logical path for a Soulknife Rogue or Great Old One Warlock; in the case of the Warlock, their patron might be the telepathic gestalt of Lost itself."

They learned long ago to value their cunning over strength; the heroes of their tales are quick and clever.

They could come from Graywall or the Great Crag, having seen the rise of Droaam but now looking out for their own interests.

Almost all the minotaur clans revere the Horned King, and believe that the greatest champions will join their king after death. However, each clan has their own private name for the Horned King, and their own beliefs about the conduct he expects from his followers. Regardless of his name, most interpretations follow the basic principles of Tol Kharash: warfare and conquest, using fear and force to crush all enemies. However, the Red Hooves worship He Who Walks Behind, who is much like the Mockery; they focus on the use of terror and in deceiving their enemies. The Blade Breakers worship One Horn, who rewards strength and courage\u2014much like Dol Dorn. The Dawn Harvest was a clan whose version of the Prince\u2014the Dawn Gorer\u2014encouraged followers to fight with honor and to defend the weak, two traits rarely seen in Droaam. The Dawn Harvest was destroyed by Maenya's Fist after refusing to accept Rhesh Turakbar as the warlord of their region; a few members of the clan survived and are now scattered across Droaam.",

However, this aggression prevented the minotaurs from becoming a major power in the region, due to the long, destructive feuds between the clans themselves. The clans were delighted by the decade of conflict with Breland, and minotaurs continue to be the most common reavers found crossing the Border Road in search of glory. Minotaurs are fierce and brave, but they generally lack patience and discipline. They are terrifying raiders, but most lack discipline and have no patience for careful tactics. Most of the minotaur clans are tied to the warlord Rhesh Turakbar, but some clans have integrated with Droaam as a whole, and minotaurs can be found serving with Maenya's Fist, the Flayer Guard, House Tharashk, and others.",
														"The archetypal minotaur is a Barbarian, eager for battle and to defeat enemies in the name of the Horned King. This devotion doesn't prevent a minotaur from being a heroic adventurer; the Horned King accepts all worthy kills, no matter the cause or motives of the minotaur. Fiend Warlocks are also common among the clans that dwell near Turakbar's Fist. However, a minotaur adventurer could have turned their back on the traditions of their people.

They're used to their strength and durability carrying them through life and don't generally have to think quickly; everything will work out in time. Ogres typically pursue simple pleasures: food, drink, and crushing small creatures that annoy them. The various warlords charm them with harpy song and fill them with grist, then set them to work lifting heavy things and smashing things that need to be smashed. They're often recruited into local brute squads and serve as basic shock troops in the armies of Droaam. But they aren't innately aggressive. As chibs in the Barrens, ogres would use their strength to gather what they needed to live a comfortable life, including tiny servants. But unlike the Gaa'aram or the minotaur clans, they would rarely raid others or seek conflict for pleasure; in many ways, they can be seen as mighty children. While physically powerful, they're easily swayed by strong personalities and compelling stories. They are very emotional\u2014though they can shift between emotions rapidly\u2014and love stories and songs, even if stories need to be kept simple. It's not uncommon for an ogre to develop a deep attachment to their favorite harpy or changeling storyteller. As long as they are happy, ogres can be kind and even gentle.",

Where the goblins and kobolds were often enslaved by more powerful creatures, the Gaa'aram voluntarily rallied around the most powerful leaders and served as fierce warriors. To an orc of the Gaa'aram, who you fight for is less important than the fact that you fight and fight well. As such, Gaa'aram orcs were often encountered as raiders; they're the reason for the name of the fortress that guards the gap between the Graywall Mountains and Silver Lake; Orcbone. Gaa'aram orcs can be found in all the diverse cities, and they're passionate supporters both of Droaam and their local warlords.",

They believe that violence stains the soul\u2014that those whose souls are pure when they die will pass beyond Dolurrh, but that killing another forever destroys a piece of your soul. The Gaa'ran held firm to their beliefs even in the face of torment and slavery, and over time it became common for the Barrens chibs to allow Gaa'ran settlements to stand\u2014with the understanding that the local raiders would regularly show up and take their produce. While this was a harsh life, the Gaa'ran have prospered under the Daughters of Sora Kell. Though grist is the primary source of sustenance in Droaam, the Daughters recognize the value of agriculture, and Gaa'ran tribes have been given resources and placed in charge of a number of agricultural projects.",
														"There is, of course, a third source of orcs one might meet on the frontier: House Tharashk. The House of the Mark of Finding has come to an understanding with the Daughters of Sora Kell. Tharashk prospectors are searching for dragonshards in the Barrens, Tharashk bounty hunters ply their trade across the frontier, and Tharashk recruiters urge Droaamite mercenaries to broker their services through the house. The house has its local seat in the Calabas district of Graywall, where viceroy Kundran Torrn oversees the enclave and the district. While Tharashk scions may be orcs, humans, or jhorgun'taal (half-orcs), orcs make up the majority of the house agents on the frontier.",

								"The heart of the Western Frontier is the vast stretch of plains that lies between the Korlaac Rift to the west and the Whitehorn Woods in the east. In the south, the Graywall Mountains serve as a simple dividing line between Droaam and Breland, but there's no clear natural boundary in the central plains. As a result, people have turned to an unnatural feature; the Orien trade road that runs between Ardev and Sylbaran. For centuries, this road has been a crucial channel for trade and supplies. During the Last War, Breland maintained forces at the Eldeen Ford, but the agreements with the Dragonmarked Houses kept Aundair from targeting the road. In the wake of the war, it has continued to serve as a crucial path for commerce between Breland, Aundair, and the Eldeen Reaches. As they are working to forge alliances with the dragonmarked houses, the Daughters of Sora Kell are reluctant to disrupt the trade road\u2014and Breland is determined to hold it, recently assigning Argonth to patrol the edge of the road. While Breland has yet to acknowledge Droaam's sovereignty, the common people recognize the trade road as the line between the two nations\u2014and this idea was strengthened when House Sivis used the road to define the boundary between Droaam and Breland. While its official name is Orien Route 7, if you've spent any time on the Western Frontier, you know it as the Border Road.",
								"The Border Road isn't a hard line. There are kobolds camping in the more fertile lands east of the road and Brelish settlers seizing opportunities to the west. If a patrol of Westwind Riders is chasing brigands on the Brelish side, they won't stop the instant the bandits cross the Border Road into Droaamish lands. However, the Border Road is a definite line of truce between the two nations. The Westwind Riders won't cross the road unless they have reason to\u2014and the Znir gnolls serving the Daughters of Sora Kell keep their patrols to the west of the road. If they're on the western side of the Border Road, the minotaurs of Turakbar's Fist are soldiers of Droaam defending their nation; if they're encountered to the east of the road, they're raiders seeking glory. Such raids often go both ways; the Brelish draw attention to these minotaur attacks, but prefer not to address the fact that the Black Crown brigands are just as brutal when they attack Droaamite settlements on the west side of the road. If you're Brelish, you can consider yourself generally safer if you stay to the east, and Droaamites feel more secure west of the Border Road\u2014but there's no absolute security anywhere on the Western Frontier, unless you're inside Argonth.",
								"As an adventurer, your travels will likely lead you off the beaten trail, but the Border Road is at the center of the Western Frontier, and the focus of commerce and travel. The plains around the road are sparsely populated and filled with dangers: wandering monstrosities, brigands, sinkholes, and other unexpected hazards. You can easily blaze your own trail across the plains, but if you do, there's a chance you could go a day or more without even seeing another humanoid, let alone an inn\u2014and if you're set upon by bandits, there's little chance the Westwind Riders will show up to save you. The Border Road is paved and maintained. Brelish forces patrol the road. There are Gold Dragon Inns waiting for you at Sylbaran, Unicorn Point, Quickstone, and Ardev. There are a host of hamlets and farmsteads along the road; like a river, this channel of trade and travel provides a strong foundation for new communities to build on. These benefits come with a dark side though; because the Border Road is the safest, best maintained route for commerce, it's also the prime target for brigands and highwaymen. Think of it like pirates on the sea, but instead of galleons there are Orien Thunder Coaches laden with goods. While there are many forces that work to counter banditry\u2014the Westwind Riders, Argonth, the Blades of Orien\u2014the road is long, and successful bandits move quickly.",

This mixture is infused with a dash of finely ground Siberys dragonshards, which facilitates the magical effects employed by Orien heirs; this causes the road to glitter faintly in Bright Light, and harmless sparks sometimes rise under the hooves or wheels of Orien-enhanced vehicles and mounts. There are no guardrails or barriers along most of the length of the road, but in regions where the terrain is particularly hazardous to vehicles\u2014for example, a stretch in the north with swamplike terrain\u2014there are two-foot railings along the edge of the road.",

A vehicle or mount carrying a passenger with the Dragonmark of Passage can add an additional 10% to its pace; the passive enchantments worked into the road are triggered by the Mark of Passage, enhancing the momentum of the Orien heir and their mount.",
										"Breland maintains watchtowers that are spaced every 20 miles along the road. These are simple towers\u2014often just a platform atop a pillar\u2014where a handful of soldiers keep an eye out for trouble. The guards at these watchtowers aren't sufficient to battle bandits or raiders alone; but if they spot trouble, they can trigger an Alarm that alerts Orcbone, while sending up a flare to summon any nearby Brelish forces. Aside from this, there are villages, hamlets, and farmsteads all along the road. Most of these are small communities without dragonmarked services; they rely on the constant stream of traffic for news and services. However, villages usually have some form of pub or inn that travelers can take Advantage of, even if services are somewhat limited. The primary stopoff for travelers is Unicorn Point, an Orien outpost halfway between the Graywall Mountains and the Eldeen border."

A third suggests that Mesa was actually driven from her home in the hills by some sort of gibbering Aberrations\u2014that while she won't speak of it, some day she intends to return and reclaim her caves. Whatever the truth, what is known with certainty is that Mesa is both a stone giant and a master stoneworker. She occasionally helps the Gant stonemasons with new constructions, but she prefers to sculpt. Her work has a surreal aspect, and seems designed to evoke feeling rather than to perfectly recreate the subject. There is a statue of the late Countess Thalia\u2014Thavius's mother, slain by the Daughters of Sora Kell\u2014in the town square, that evokes a sense both of Thalia's courage and the tragedy of her loss. Other works are more abstract, but have a way of evoking strong feelings in the observer. Mesa and her work are both celebrated as curiosities in the region; her smaller works can be purchased in the Ardev Market, and Mesa herself often performs feats of strength and participates in other ways in local festivals."

The second, potentially more serious, claim is that Rustav hates both the monarchy in general and Count ir'Blis in particular, and that he's a strong supporter of the Blades of Liberty.

										"For generations, the fortress Orcbone and its Westwind Riders have been the primary defense of the Western Frontier. That changed in 998 YK, when King Boranel assigned Argonth to the region. Once the most imposing weapon in Breland's arsenal, Argonth is a floating fortress quartering over a thousand soldiers and enough arcane artillery to level a village. Its presence in the region shows that Boranel recognizes the growing power of Droaam and the potential for renewed conflict. Argonth guards the southern stretch of the border; Orcbone is too far north to be able to quickly respond to an attack against Quickstone or the Westroad, the recently upgraded road to Graywall. While its mobility is useful, Argonth only has a sustainable cruising speed of 2 miles per hour and it can easily be avoided by mounted brigands or smugglers. But while it may not be able to intercept a small force of minotaur reavers, it can hold the Westroad against thousands if it comes to war.",
										"There is a second reason Boranel has assigned Argonth to the frontier. Impressive as it is, Argonth is almost eighty years old and it is one of the last of the floating fortresses. Breland stopped building the fortresses in 970 YK; military strategy has shifted, and Breland is currently following other paths (developing swift, mobile forces; improving artillery; developing air forces). On the Aundairian border, Argonth is something of a relic. But on the frontier, Argonth serves as a check on the Droaamite forces stationed at Graywall and as a symbol of Breland's determination to hold the region.",
										"Argonth is an active fortress. It has the population of a small town, but these people are soldiers. Over fourteen hundred crewmembers are combat-ready, with the remainder being dedicated solely to support and administration.

The Force Staffs draw power from the elemental engine and don't require Breath of Siberys, but the others must be loaded normally. Argonth also has sixteen Long Rods, which can be removed and distributed to ground troops if necessary. This arcane artillery, and the Breath of Siberys that powers it, are described in Exploring Eberron.",
														"Argonth employs three bound elementals: earth, fire, and water. Pilots don't have to have dragonmarks, but a side effect of this is that the binding and control process is more dangerous and demanding. Argonth requires a team of active pilots, and pushing the fortress to higher speeds takes a mental and physical toll on the pilots. At one point during the Last War, Argonth maintained a sustained speed of 10 miles per hour for two days to respond to an attack; three pilots died from overexertion.",

While Galifar was intact, the primary mission of Orcbone was patrolling Orien Route 7, dealing with any bandits who threatened the Border Road. For much of the Last War, this region had little strategic value and Orcbone was underfunded and understaffed. This changed with the rise of Droaam. In 986 YK, Countess Thalia ir'Blis was killed by Droaamite forces and Orcbone itself suffered grave damage. King Boranel reinforced the fortress and appointed Commander Veirner ir'Tajar. Orcbone has held the line for the last decade, resisting a siege in 989 YK and serving as an important base of operations for lesser conflicts along the Western Frontier. However, with the rise of Graywall and Quickstone, most areas of strategic importance are in the southern region of the frontier, far from Orcbone. While the fortress continues to hold the line against Rhesh Turakbar and the forces of Turakbar's Fist, Boranel has deployed the floating fortress Argonth to secure the southern region and to serve as a symbol of Brelish might. Commander ir'Tajar sees this as a stinging rebuke of his command, and he may be right to think this; he's made questionable decisions over the last few years, and the deeds of Breggan Blackcrown\u2014both when she served under ir'Tajar's command and now as a brigand\u2014are a stain on his record.

Some believe you can still find shards of ancient bone around the fortress, while others claim that this was a foolish act that has left the region haunted by the restless spirits of fallen orcs.",

Orcbone is built to withstand a siege, and the forces of the Barrens have attacked it a surprising number of times; the reavers see it as a way to test their mettle. However, given that attackers can easily just circle around the fortress, Orcbone's primary mission is to serve as a base of operations for the Westwind Riders, a cavalry force that patrols the Border Road and quickly responds to threats. There are watchtowers scattered around the region, approximately 20 miles apart. Each tower can signal Orcbone using a form of Alarm. This doesn't allow any sort of detailed message; if the alarm sounds, it's a call for the Westwind Riders to respond.",

Over the centuries, a series of wide ditches have been dug into the hill. To approach Orcbone, you must pass through these trenches while being fired upon by the archers in the keep; the classic Orcbone strategy is to have a force of Westwind Riders approach the attacking force from the rear, crushing them up against the walls of the keep. The keep itself shows its age; the walls are chipped and scorched. The Commander's requests for greater funds are generally met with the statement \"We sent you aid; we sent you Argonth.\"",

With the rise of Droaam, Quickstone drew the interest of followers of the Three Faces of Coin, who saw the opportunities the border town presents for both legitimate trade and smuggling. Quickstone lies on Orien's Westroad and it has recently become the western terminus of the lightning rail. For those who want to do business with Droaam but don't feel safe in Graywall, Quickstone is the last outpost of Brelish civilization.

Both of these groups largely dwell in temporary shelters outside of town while they wait for more permanent residences to become available. A third group recently joined this tent community\u2014a group of Khaar'paal kobolds, who are using their sorcerous talents to help Orien expand the lightning rail toward Droaam.

										"Affectionately known as \"Tribex Town,\" Shavalant lies at the center of a vast array of ranches in the business of raising plains tribex, riding tribex, and a wide range of other livestock; the Vadalis enclave known as the Farm breeds war beasts, including Breland's famed dire bears. While Shavalant has a smaller population than Ardev or the great cities of the east, it is a wide town; ranchers 20 miles away from the town center still consider themselves to be part of Shavalant. The Farm is House Vadalis's largest enclave in Breland, and almost everyone in the town works for the house in some capacity. This doesn't prevent the people of Shavalant from being proudly Brelish; most believe their work strengthens both the house and their nation, and they see House Vadalis as a positive in the world.",
										"Shavalant lies just north of Whitehorn Wood, and ranches run along the edge of the vast forest. The town flies a white flag that bears an image of a rampant bear with curling horns. This is Whitehorn, who the locals will tell you is a patron of both Shavalant and Breland. According to the stories, Whitehorn is a massive horned bear\u2014\"larger than the largest dragon\"\u2014who dwells deep in the Whitehorn Woods. When settlers first came to the region, they cut back the woods and angered Whitehorn, who emerged and crushed their farmsteads. Eventually, Hala d'Vadalis\u2014who the locals generally call \"Hala Whitehorn''\u2014established a clear set of edicts about how to deal with the Whitehorn Woods, limiting harvesting and hunting. According to the legends, since then, Whitehorn has dwelled in harmony with the townsfolk, and people even swear that if the town is truly threatened, Whitehorn will emerge from the woods and defend it.",
										"While it's a charming story, this is Breland, not the Eldeen Reaches; Shavalant is an industrial town. There's a powerful Lamannian manifest zone in the Whitehorn Woods, and House Vadalis is harnessing the power of that zone to enhance the production of livestock. Beasts born in the ranches adjacent to the zone are especially strong and fertile. Attempts to cut back the woods or overharvesting of its resources trigger catastrophic effects\u2014including attacks by swarms of birds, dire beasts, and possibly, a megafauna bear. Beyond this, any structures built beyond the \"forest line\" rapidly rot or corrode. The people of Shavalant have learned exactly where the line is and they push right up to the edge. They do harvest lumber and hunt on the edge of the Whitehorn, taking Advantage of how quickly things regrow; it's simply that Hala's edicts set clear boundaries on just what can be harvested from the woods and when. People may love their Whitehorn flag, but there's no druidic reverence here: This is a practical arrangement based on scientific principles.",

Every year someone lobbies for the hunt to take place in Whitehorn, but Viceroy Kyara doesn't want to disturb the powers sheltering within the woods.",
														"Shavalant was briefly occupied by Aundair during the Last War, but they underestimated the deadly capabilities of the war beasts Vadalis had at its disposal. While most of these are well known\u2014notably, the dire bears\u2014many say that the Farm has a host of scorpions and serpents bred to serve as primal assassins.",
														"A far more dangerous attack came in 993 YK, when a group of Ashbound druids from the Eldeen Reaches caused chaos by turning the beasts of Shavalant against the ranchers. The Ashbound were slain, but there was significant damage and death. Some believe that a wounded Ashbound druid escaped into Whitehorn and may yet return to wreak further destruction.",
														"Druids and anyone from the Eldeen Reaches receive a cold reception in Shavalant, and anyone openly declaring themselves to be Ashbound will face an angry mob. While this is linked to the Ashbound incident, it also ties to a larger idea that druidic beliefs are directly at odds with Shavalant's way of doing business... and if a Shavalant farmer wants to keep battery hens, you can shut up and eat your damn eggs."

The Gold Dragon Inn offers exactly the same services you'll find at the Gold Dragon Inn in Ardev or Graywall; it's reliable and certainly comfortable, but unremarkable.

The Milk Bar is a joint venture of a Ghallanda and Vadalis heir, offering the milk of a vast assortment of beasts and even a few monstrosities. If you can afford better\u2014or at least more local\u2014than the Gold Dragon Inn, the Brand is the oldest inn in Shavalant and is especially celebrated for its steaks and savory pies.",

The Triple Horn and the Arrowhead ranches breed riding tribex, while the Lazy Dragon and Gray Bull ranches breed plains tribex for meat, leather, and as beasts of burden. These are just a few that focus on tribex; if you live in Breland and own a tribex, the odds are good you can trace its lineage back to Shavalant. A more exotic ranch is the Royal Bear, which shifted focus (and name) during the Last War to focus on breeding and training dire bears. A similarly exotic ranch is the Bright Beak, which specializes in breeding hippogriffs.",
												"The most important location in Shavalant is the Farm, the casual name for a Vadalis enclave that includes a sprawling central keep and a few acres of pastures, stables, and training facilities. The Farm includes an administrative wing where Viceroy Kyara contemplates long-term strategies and evaluates reports from the many ranches Vadalis manages or licenses. Another wing is devoted to evaluating and working with new or exotic beasts and monstrosities; if Vadalis decides to try domesticating cockatrices, they'd start by bringing some to the Farm. The stables at the Farm are devoted to beasts that can't yet be handed off to a ranch. During the war, a few generations of dire bears were bred at the Farm before the work was transferred to the Royal Bear ranch. At the moment, they could be working on a better breed of tribex, a bloodhound with a sharper sense of smell, or songbirds that can mimic the voices of famous entertainers. The most secure branch of the Farm is the War Offices, where heirs work to evaluate and hone the martial abilities of their beasts. This includes developing more efficient means of training existing war beasts\u2014war tribex, war horses, war hounds\u2014as well as working to magebreed traits that could make such animals more effective on the battlefield. As suggested earlier, there are certainly rumors that the War Office has a division\u2014and perhaps, a secret subterranean facility\u2014devoted to beasts that can be used as tools of assassination.",
												"Thanks to the importance of House Vadalis's operations, Shavalant has a suite of dragonmarked services. The small Kundarak bank and Sivis message station (Stone 124) share a building. Orien has a station that runs a steady stream of caravans, including coaches designed to transport large beasts and preserving coaches that use a form of Gentle Repose to transport meat. The local Jorasco clinic is called Helping Hands. House Deneith has an office that focuses on providing security for ranchers in need, and Tharashk maintains an outpost that's mainly a waystation for private inquisitives and bounty hunters. Finally, in addition to the Farm and its many ranches, House Vadalis runs a facility formally called The College of Balinor's Gift but is more generally just called Farm School; this offers training in mundane and magical techniques of animal husbandry and veterinary medicine.",
												"Shavalant has a small temple devoted to the Sovereign Host, and most especially to Balinor\u2014the Sovereign who grants dominion over the animal kingdom. Services are conducted by Tolan Gray, a shifter who asserts that House Vadalis is blessed by Balinor. In return, Vadalis strongly supports the church... and it is likely no coincidence that Tolan Gray also serves as the magistrate of Shavalant."

Common practice is to refer to these fey patrons as their great-grandfathers or great-grandmothers, though some villages have other customs. Much like the people of Shavalant and the Whitehorn Wood, the Lakefolk don't romanticize these relationships or have any special love for the fey. It's a simple business arrangement they need to fulfill, and some Lakefolk resent these lingering agreements. On the other hand, breaking a pact can have disastrous consequences; there are a few ghost towns along the shore, abandoned because of the enmity between the villagers and the resident fey. Most of the Lakefolk aren't especially knowledgeable about the fey and don't have a way to reliably contact their patron. The wandering Greensinger known as Briar has often sought to serve as an intermediary between the Lakefolk and their patrons, but many of the Lakefolk don't want some outsider interfering with their business.

The fisherfolk sing fish into their nets.

										"Overall, the people of Sylbaran are happy folk who love their town and the natural world around it. Sylbarans know their neighbors and are always ready to lend a hand to other members of the community. They prefer harmony to strife and prefer to solve problems peacefully whenever possible. However, they're quite used to dealing with outsiders who don't share these ideals. While Sylbarans are patient with travelers, there are limits to this patience. Animal abuse (such as mistreating mounts) will not be tolerated, and someone seen pissing in the lake is likely to be thrown in it. The townsfolk stick together, and if someone sees a crime being committed, they will typically raise a hue and cry and get involved, rather than passing by. However, there are always new outsiders who don't know the ways of the Reaches, so there's always trouble to be found.",

No mortal hand or mundane tool could shape such a thing. It is a vile relic of a forgotten age, the hand of an overlord raised in defiance. The Dhakaani named it t'Kaash, the Fist.

										"For centuries, Orien Route 7 has been an important trade road allowing for the transport of goods between Breland and Aundair. Unicorn Point was established centuries ago as a simple Orien waystation to support couriers and caravans. Then they realized that they needed a Vadalis presence to provide fresh mounts for couriers and caravan teams. And what about a Gold Dragon Inn to support the increasing traffic? And a Jorasco healer to take care of injured travelers? And a Cannith tinker to repair damaged vehicles? With each such addition, Unicorn Point grew, until it had truly become a town in its own right. However, it's in a strange middle ground because it's not a traditional town. The residents of Unicorn Point aren't Brelish or Droaamite, they're all heirs of the dragonmarked houses. There is no mayor or magistrate; everyone in Unicorn Point works there, and the houses are renting the land from Count ir'Blis. House Orien has the strongest presence in Unicorn Point, but they don't hold any sort of absolute authority over the other house representatives. In general, it's in everyone's best interests to get along... but there's a lot of room for interhouse intrigue at Unicorn Point! Overall, Unicorn Point is dense, functional, and relentlessly commercial. Every service is tied to a house guild. All permanent residents live in house outposts. It's not a town; it's more like a spaceport or a truck stop.",

										"Long ago, Cazhaak Draal was a major metropolis of the Empire of Dhakaan. It was destroyed in a conflict with the daelkyr Orlassk, who unleashed deadly creatures and curses on the region. In 778 YK, a group of medusa settlers emerged from Khyber and took possession of the ancient city. Today, Cazhaak Draal is the center of medusa culture in Droaam. While the medusas are few in number, their intelligence, discipline, and deadly power make them valuable allies for the Daughters of Sora Kell. The medusas support the Daughters' vision for a united Droaam, and they have helped to keep the more savage elements of the nation in line; even a troll will watch its temper around a medusa. Beyond this, the medusas of Cazhaak Draal are capable magewrights and especially talented stoneworkers. Across Droaam, medusa architects are devising the blueprints for the growing cities of the young nation.",
										"Cazhaak Draal lies in a region called the Stonelands. This is a harsh land in the foothills of the Byeshk Mountains, infested with cockatrices, basilisks, and other dangerous monstrosities. Once, the land was fertile; the curses of Orlassk petrified everything, and now there are stone trees and grass. In some regions, the curse holds and nothing grows, but elsewhere the stone trees are encircled by living ivy and grasses. The medusas have an affinity for the monstrosities and ways to deal with the widespread stone, so they have prospered here. None of the other inhabitants of Droaam have ever tried to challenge them for this bleak territory; aside from pilgrims devoted to the Dark Six, most creatures shun the Stonelands.",
										"While the bulk of the population is concentrated in Cazhaak Draal, there are a handful of small communities scattered around the Stonelands\u2014monasteries, basilisk ranches, and a few farms. There are few inns in the Stonelands, but many medusas will offer a traveler shelter as long as they're civil. The original metropolis of Cazhaak Draal was a sprawling city with tens of thousands of goblinoid inhabitants. The modern city occupies just a fraction of the original. Over the centuries, the medusas have explored the old city, but they have largely left the petrified Dhakaani in place. When you walk through the outer rings of Cazhaak Draal, you can experience the moment that the city fell. The inner city has been entirely rebuilt, using curving serpentine designs and patterns that showcase medusa stonework. Like the mountains near the town of Quickstone, the Stonelands include significant deposits of quickstone, and the architects of Cazhaak Draal are quite adept at working with this material.",
										"The medusas of Cazhaak Draal are a spiritual people, so much so that their traditions of worship have become the dominant religion in the region. Cazhaak Draal includes a grand temple devoted to the Dark Six, along with smaller shrines devoted to each individual member of the six. These shrines are spread around the inner city, so that pilgrims can visit their chosen shrine without having to enter the city proper. There are also a number of monasteries and anchorite cells spread around the Stonelands, where medusa mystics contemplate the mysteries of the Six. The primary inhabitants of Cazhaak Draal are the medusas, with a strong secondary population of gargoyles; only Grimstone Keep has a larger population of gargoyles. Most other creatures find the Stonelands to be harsh and frightening; prior to the unification of Droaam, devoted pilgrims would travel to the Shrines of the Six, but few would remain. With the establishment of the new nation, Queen Sheshka has encouraged members of other species to come to Cazhaak Draal. There is a growing kobold population, along with a contingent of humans and tieflings from the Venomous Demesne. Both gargoyles and medusas are long lived but have a slow rate of reproduction; now that the population is increasing, they are beginning to reclaim the ruins around the inner city and expand Cazhaak Draal.",

										"In 870 YK, a force of Silver Flame templars discovered an ancient Dhakaani fortress that was almost perfectly preserved\u2014completely shunned by the Gaa'aram orcs and other denizens of the region. It seemed the locals were afraid of the karaguls\u2014the fearsome statues of fiendish creatures that studded the walls of the outpost and lined its halls. The templars dismissed these superstitions. They named the outpost Brightstone Keep and held it for over a century. The templars of Brightstone Keep sought to protect settlers from the east from the many threats of the region, and hunted those things they considered monsters. And so it continued until 986 YK, when Sora Katra came to Brightstone Keep and spoke to the statues on the walls... all of which were gargoyles. Most had remained dormant for thousands of years, choosing to ignore the templars in their roost. But Katra's whispers drew them from their slumber and promised rewards for their loyalty. Roused from their sleep, the gargoyles drove out the templars and claimed the fortress as their own. As the conflict between Droaam and Breland escalated, the Daughters sent troops to garrison the fortress, under the authority of the gargoyle warlord Cairngorm.",
										"Grimstone Keep is home to the largest population of gargoyles in Khorvaire, including both the original gargoyles of Brightstone Keep and others who were originally scattered across the region. The warlord Cairngorm is actively working to foster a sense of cultural identity among the gargoyles, and is encouraging the exploration of art and the celebration of storytelling, a favorite pastime among the stonefolk. Cairngorm has also been pushing the gargoyles to explore their own potential. There are rumors that the gargoyle warlord has been engaging in disturbing experiments with demonglass or fiendish possession\u2014that Cairngorm is drawing on some power of Khyber in this pursuit of gargoyle perfection\u2014but these are merely rumors.",

Goblins and kobolds work on maintenance and support. A mixed force of orcs, shifters, ogres, and other creatures stands ready for any general military operations, along with an elite force of Znir gnolls and a squad of war trolls tasked to protect Cairngorm. The gargoyles themselves provide aerial support and scouting, as well as carrying messages between major outposts. With this in mind, Grimstone Keep isn't designed for the entertainment of travelers. The gargoyles socialize with one another, and everyone is welcome in their storytelling circles. Droaamites can get shelter and grist at Grimstone Keep, but traveling easterners will have to camp outside the fortress walls.",

												"\"The Misplaced Village\" is a Brelish fairytale, a variation of the story of the Forgotten Prince. In this version, the Traveler visits a village plagued by bandits and war and offers to hide them from their enemies, promising \"No one will ever find you.\" The villagers eagerly accept the offer, only coming to realize, as the ritual was taking effect, that the gifts of the Traveler always have a price. And so it came to pass: The village disappeared... And no one ever found it again.",
												"The purpose of this story is to highlight the dangers of trusting strangers and the need to consider the consequences of the bargains you make. No one in the Five Nations thought it was based on anything real... Until the Daughters of Sora Kell first summoned their chosen warlords to the Great Crag, and a changeling shifted through a handful of forms before showing its (presumably) true face and introducing itself as the Warlord of Lost. Others in Droaam were already familiar with Lost\u2014Sora Teraza had come to the village to forge the initial alliance\u2014but the powers of the east were surprised to learn that there was an entire community of shapeshifters they knew nothing about. In the years that have followed, the changelings of Lost have become an important part of the Daughters' regime. Changelings often serve as Katra's Voice or Teraza's Eyes, gathering information or using their gifts to fill the classic role of the bard, sharing news with different communities and raising spirits. While the denizens of Lost are part of Droaam society, Lost itself remains shrouded in mystery. Reliable accounts claim that the village is mobile and alive\u2014that the houses of Lost are a massive form of mimic known as facades. According to the stories, these facades can assume the shapes of anything from a tent to a hut to a wagon. Thus, within moments, Lost could shift from looking like a camp of gnolls to being a wagon train, and as a train it can move to a new location. Thus, any small community could potentially be Lost. It's also believed that the facades of Lost are naturally resistant to divination, which has helped hide the village from potential enemies.",
												"So what's known about Lost is that it's a small community of changelings that can hide in plain sight and move whenever it chooses to. The changelings of Lost possess telepathic gifts that allow them to communicate silently and to read the thoughts of others, which helps them maintain their deception. They excel in the creation of mutable materials: Shiftweave, Glamoured Armor, Hats of Disguise, and anything in this vein; an assassin from Lost may have a walking stick that can turn into a rapier. Stories further suggest that at least some of the changelings of Lost are exceptional thieves, and that over the course of centuries they have stolen many interesting things from across Khorvaire; if you're looking for a lost relic of the Silver Flame or the scepter of the Dhakaani emperor, it's possible it's hidden away in Lost. The motives of the changelings of Lost remain enigmatic. Many familiar with the situation doubt that the \"Warlord of Lost\" is an individual, guessing that it's a constructed identity shared by all the changelings of Lost when it's needed. Some question if there's any way to know that Lost is just one village, or if there could in fact be a half-dozen shapeshifting villages moving around Droaam. Ultimately, what matters is that Lost is out there\u2014and that potentially any small village you encounter in Droaam could be Lost.",

Some say it was a changeling of Lost who gave Tira Miron her sword Kloijner (unlikely) and who presented Breggan Blackcrown with the crown of Breggor Firstking (quite possible).",
																"The changelings of Lost work to hone their telepathic abilities. Most possess telepathy with a range of 60 feet and the ability to cast Detect Thoughts at will. If you're playing a changeling from Lost, you can choose to develop these powers by taking the Telepathy feat presented in Tasha's Cauldron of Everything.",
																"Changelings from Lost may have other remarkable abilities. Some have the talents of bards, specializing in enchantment, illusion, and transmutation. Others learn to assume beast forms, much like a Circle of the Moon druid. So if you're searching for Lost, keep in mind that even beasts could be the villagers you're looking for!"

												"Shaarat Kol is a city in southwestern Droaam, set against and into the western face of the Graywall Mountains. Like Cazhaak Draal, it is built on the foundations of an ancient Dhakaani city; unlike Cazhaak Draal, far more of the original city remains intact. The city was either abandoned or completely depopulated during the wars with the daelkyr. Those parts of the city that were above ground were damaged by battle and the passage of time. At one point, an ogre chieftain built a simple fortress within these ruins, and this changed hands many times over the centuries. But much of Shaarat Kol was underground, and in its final days its gates were sealed with both Arcane Locks and adamantine bars. None of the chibs and chieftains who claimed the fortress on the surface were ever able to delve below. None, that is, until Kethelrax the Cunning came along. In 985 YK, Kethelrax was the leader of a band of goblins and kobolds\u2014rebels hiding in the Graywall Mountains and raiding the thuggish chibs. One day, Sora Katra came to his camp, and the two talked for hours. In the month that followed, Kethelrax led his followers in a daring attack against the ogres and their ettin chib who held the ruins of Shaarat Kol. It was a vicious fight, but Kethelrax's forces won the day and claimed the fortress... and using the knowledge Katra had shared, Kethelrax was able to open the gates of the old city and discover the true face of Shaarat Kol.",
												"The name of the city is Goblin for \"Forge of Swords\" and it was once an industrial center of the Dhakaani, home to some of their greatest forge adepts. The city was largely intact and contained resources untouched for thousands of years; while many of these resources were lost to time, adamantine doesn't age. However, the city was lost during war, and the ancient daashors left countless traps along with their treasures. There are amazing facilities and other wonders to be found in Shaarat Kol, but claiming them is a slow process. Even now, more than a decade later, the denizens of Shaarat Kol have only reclaimed an estimated 20% of the ancient city.",
												"At the moment, Sharaat Kol is essentially two cities. The Upper City is on the surface, which is being expanded and rebuilt in the new Droaamite style seen in Graywall and the Great Crag. Most of the people of the city live in the Upper City and it's where most business takes place. But there's also the Undercity, which lies beyond the ancient gates. This is where Kethelrax holds court and where his most loyal and talented followers dwell. Should there ever be a serious attack, Kethelrax could seal the gates\u2014and when those gates were last sealed, they held off intruders for thousands of years.",
												"The Upper City of Shaarat Kol is a haven for trade, known for the vast Goblin Market. This is an even larger cousin of the Bloody Market found in Graywall. All manner of independent artisans, hunters, and magewrights sell their goods and services. You can hire mercenaries, buy plunder from raiders, browse trinkets scavenged from Dhakaani ruins, or barter for dangerous imports from the Venomous Demesne. The Goblin Market is a vast open space largely filled with tents and temporary housing. Looking at the permanent buildings, roughly two-thirds of the structures are built for the comfort of small creatures, with another third of the city being designed to accommodate medium and large creatures. Kethelrax has sworn that Shaarat Kol will be a haven for goblins and kobolds, long oppressed in this region; he's building this city first and foremost for his people. The Undercity of Shaarat Kol uses the intact infrastructure of the ancient Dhakaani city. This was an industrial center and it contains mines, foundries, and forges. Kethelrax and his people are working to restore these facilities and to make use of them. While some of the great daashors were hobgoblins, the golin'dar (goblins) were the primary artisans of the empire, and much of the city is designed for their comfort. As noted before, the process of reclaiming the Undercity is slow, and there are always teams at work exploring new sections and trying to clear out traps and defenses. But just in the area that's been reclaimed, Kethelrax has been able to get a foundry and an ore processing facility working, and they are learning a great deal about the process the Dhakaani used to create and work adamantine. This is only the start, but Shaarat Kol has the potential to play a very important role in the future of Droaam.",
												"Unlike Graywall, Shaarat Kol has made little effort to welcome the Five Nations. There's no Orien trade route and no Dragonmarked outposts in the City of Goblins. The coastline to the south is rocky and dangerous, and it is difficult for large ships to land. Kethelrax is actively working to construct a safe port so that Shaarat Kol can rival Vralkek as an important shipping destination. For now, there are a few safe havens for those who know them, but they only support small ships. All this means that the people of the Five Nations who come to Shaarat Kol are mainly smugglers. There are all kinds of valuable goods available in the Goblin Market, including many that are taxed or prohibited in the Five Nations. Some smugglers trek paths and hidden passages through the Graywall Mountains, while others dare travel the dangerous coastline in small boats. While Kethelrax and the Daughters haven't tried to bring the Dragonmarked Houses to Shaarat Kol, he's happy to deal with legitimate traders, hence his work on the port; he just wants to finish securing the Undercity and unlocking its potential before bringing easterners into the city in large numbers.",
												"Goblins and kobolds make up nearly 90% of the population of Shaarat Kol. Many of these were formerly subjugated by brutal chibs, and either fled on their own or were released from their bondage by the Daughters and allowed to go to Shaarat Kol. There is a tremendous sense of camaraderie among the people of the city; throughout the city you'll see people working together and helping their neighbors. There's only a small (literally) city watch, but that's because anywhere there's trouble, a mob of citizens will come together to deal with the problem. There are a number of large trade schools that are teaching the skills needed to use the facilities of the Undercity, and Kethelrax has brought in mentors from the Khaar'paal kobold clan to help other kobolds harness their sorcerous potential. As a result, Shaarat Kol has far more magewrights than any other city in Droaam. The city is still growing and finding its footing, but there are more casual comforts than one can find even in the Great Crag. The denizens of Shaarat Kol have largely embraced the faith of the Cazhaak Six, and there's a temple maintained by the medusa priest Shalaasa and a number of Khaar'paal adepts. In general, Shaarat Kol is one of the safest cities in Droaam, as long as you don't start any trouble. On the other hand, the camaraderie among the small denizens means that the criminals and con artists of Shaarat Kol ply their trade on the visiting tall-folk; keep an extra eye on your purse and don't buy a deed to a Byeshk mine, no matter how good the price is.",

Around five percent of the population are full tieflings.",
														"The society of the Demesne is governed by the four mazes: The Maze of Mysteries, the Maze of Promises, the Maze of Making and the Maze of Faith. The Demesne is ruled by the Council of Four, who represent the mazes. The mazes and Demesne society are discussed in more detail in the tiefling section of chapter 1.",
														"The aesthetic of the Demesne is distinctly alien and its buildings couldn't exist without the use of magic; architecture involves levitation, transmutation, and the use of teleportation and extradimensional spaces.",
														"While it is small\u2014in part because of strict population control\u2014the Venomous Demesne is significantly more advanced than the Five Nations. Each maze pursues a different branch of mystical science, and the fruits of that work are applied across the Demesne. Overall, spell effects of up to 5th level can be seen at work in daily life and effects of up to 7th level can be encountered. Teleportation Circles link different parts of the Demesne. Dead nobles can be resurrected in the Maze of Faith. Planar travel isn't common, but the Maze of Promises deals with fiends (mostly Daanvian), efreet, archfey, and other planar powers. Common magic items truly are common, and the Maze of Making can produce rare or even legendary items\u2014though they lack the industrial capacity of House Cannith and can't mass-produce these things."
													]
												},
												"That last point is important. The Demesne is more advanced than the Five Nations, but it is limited in many ways. Much of its magic and arcane science is tied to disturbing traditions, ancient pacts, and the blood of the tieflings themselves; it's not simply that the mazes refuse to share their power with non-tieflings, it's that they can't share their power with non-tieflings. Practices that seem cruel and unusual to outsiders are necessary to generate and maintain the powers they rely on. It is a place of arcane wonders, but the deeper you dig, the more disturbing it becomes.",
												"Given the isolationist nature of the Demesne, this is the extent of common knowledge about it. Smugglers are always keen to acquire goods from the Venomous Demesne\u2014whether drugs, arcane weapons, or simply curious trinkets\u2014but few will ever see the Demesne itself.

But it's not an entirely arbitrary line. The environment does suddenly shift as you head west of the Graywall Mountains, becoming drier and harsher. On a map, it looks like an entirely uniform region, a vast unending plain. In truth, it is more diverse. While much of the Barrens is made up of plains covered with scrub grass, there are stone features across the region; not mountains (except for the Great Crag, of course), but mesas and low ridges. There are also a number of deep chasms\u2014cracks possibly caused by ancient tectonic activity, creating canyons that divide the plains. Sometimes these cracks in the earth are less than a foot across, and simply require a little caution. On the other hand, the Korlaac Rift is a massive chasm that runs for nearly 60 miles. The Rift has an average depth of around 2,600 feet, but there are points where it's far deeper; some say it drops down into Khyber itself. The Rift lies between Graywall and the Great Crag; the western trade road runs to Korlaac Pass, a bridge that spans the four hundred foot gap of the chasm. In addition to these cracks, there are a number of craters that drop down into darkness; these are called gantii'shu, \"hungry holes,\" as the edges can collapse without warning.",

Prior to the Daughters of Sora Kell and their seemingly endless supply of grist, it would have been difficult to support a population the size of Graywall. Most settlements across the barrens are small hamlets housing two or three extended families, spread far enough apart so as not to be competing with neighbors for the limited resources. However, there are stretches of the Barrens that are truly barren\u2014regions of gray sand or bare stone, where all vegetation withers and dies. There's no environmental logic to the placement of these regions, which the locals call kurarat, \"dead lands.\" Many scholars believe that these swathes are the result of some ancient conflict, perhaps the war between the Dhakaani and the daelkyr.

This range is considerably less hospitable than the Graywall Mountains to the south. The peaks are high and the cliffs are often both sheer and exceptionally hard; the unusual density of the stone makes both the mining and the creation of artificial passes difficult. The net result of this is that the Byeshk Mountains are an especially favorable habitat for flying creatures, which is likely why they have long been dominated by harpies. Harpy aeries and monasteries are always in places that cannot be reached by landbound creatures, at least not without making a perilous climb.",

While there are many flights that call the Byeshk Mountains home, there are two that make their home near the frontier. The Brass Talon flight holds the southeastern edge of the Byeshk Mountains, the range along the Western Frontier. The Brass Talons are fierce warriors whose combat techniques are similar to the bardic Colleges of Swords and Valor, but the Talons rarely attack without cause; they are a monastic flight who strive to perfect the dance of song, sword, and flight. Travelers will often hear their distant songs, but unless shrines are desecrated, the Talons will usually ignore them. The Wind Howlers are another story. Their territory is to the west, slightly further from the frontier. However, they are an aggressive flight that loves to prey upon the landbound, and harpy reavers often head east to raid. The Wind Howlers are deadly archers and excel at instilling fear in their targets; their bardic traditions are similar to those of the Colleges of Lore and Whispers.",

These mountains were once an important hub for the ancient goblin civilizations, even before the Empire of Dhakaan; if you know your history, you may know that this is where Jhazaal Dhakaan united six warring kings and truly founded the empire. Because of this, the Graywall Mountains are riddled with ancient ruins\u2014Dhakaani cities and fortifications, but also the remnants of even older goblin settlements. However, in the present day, the mountains are almost completely devoid of goblinoids. Historians speculate that the Graywall saw some of the worst conflicts of the Xoriat Incursion\u2014that the majority of the peoples of that time were either completely wiped out or fled into the Barrens. This may be why there are so few hobgoblins and bugbears in Droaam when compared to Darguun, and why the goblins of Droaam have so little attachment to Dhakaani history. Some of the ruins in the Graywall Mountains have been reclaimed by other creatures; in particular, the Khaar'paal kobolds have established a number of subterranean strongholds within the Graywall. Recently, the warlord Kethelrax the Cunning took possession of the ancient city of Shaarat Kol. Other ruins remain undiscovered and undisturbed. But such places may hold deadly traps placed by the Dhakaani in their final days\u2014or more dangerous still, remnants of the forces the daelkyr unleashed in that ancient war.",

However, it's also the case that many of the most accessible deposits were discovered and exploited long ago by the Dhakaani. There are still rich veins to be found, but there's also a maze of abandoned goblin mines that may be entirely depleted.",

Kobek's Voice is a dramatically active volcano connected to Fernia.

While the Khaar'paal kobolds have a sophisticated culture, the Graywall ogres are more primal; they don't work metal, and generally employ tools of wood and stone. While there are aggressive clans, not all ogres are hostile to outsiders; a number of the Graywall clans are peaceful hunter- gatherers, who may be excited to host tiny visitors with interesting stories and songs.

But crossing into Nasaar Kol means dancing with death, and the wise avoid it. There is little flora or fauna in Nasaar Kol.

There are stories of warships vanishing and of ancient vessels being discovered with no evidence of the passage of time. There are tales of golden fish that can grant wishes and of a grand castle that can only be seen in the reflections on the water. All of these things might actually exist in the heart of Silver Lake, but they are as ephemeral and unreliable as any story. If that serpent exists, it may sleep at the bottom of the lake\u2014or it could spend most of its time in the oceans of Thelanis, only shifting into Eberron under special circumstances.",
												"What is certain is that it's dangerous to cross Silver Lake unless you're very familiar with it. You're safe enough while you're in sight of shore, though it helps if someone on the boat has a bargain with one of the lake spirits. Crossing the deeper waters is always a risk. Sailors in the region know to avoid fog banks, to throw silver overboard at the first sign of a storm, and a hundred other superstitions that can help mitigate the dangers of the deep water. If you venture into the deepest waters unprepared, anything could happen.",

There have been no confirmed sightings of this beast for centuries, and there are many who insist that the stories of a bear the size of a castle are at best exaggerations or at worst absolute fabrications. Whatever the truth, it is a concrete fact that there is a powerful Lamannian manifest zone on the northern edge of the wood. This accelerates the growth of animals and plants, and undermines any attempts to cut back the forest or introduce the trappings of civilization within it. Beasts often seem to be guided by some greater force which coordinates their actions to deal with anyone who would despoil the wood\u2014though when people have used Speak with Animals to talk to these beasts, they deny being actively controlled and say that whatever they were doing \"just seemed like the right thing to do.\"",

People say that the wood just doesn't like people, whether they're druids or lumberjacks. The people who live near Whitehorn do harvest and hunt on the edges of the wood, but everyone knows not to take too much from the Wood or to go too deep within it. With that said, there are exceptions to any rule. Perhaps a cell of the Swords of Liberty or a troop of brigands have come to terms with Whitehorn and are using the wood as a safe haven. Perhaps the wood spawns a force of myconids to defend its borders, or the Wardens of the Wood will send a delegation to try to make peace with Whitehorn!",

												"Anyone born in Breland knows the proverbs of Beggar Dane, whose collected wisdom celebrates the pragmatic spirit of the nation. Dane is an apocryphal figure; some say he was a bard who wandered the streets of Sharn, while others insist that he advised Galifar I himself during the war of unification. Whatever the truth may be, Beggar Dane is a beloved Brelish everyman, and his wisdom is celebrated in Brelish taverns and homes every day. But now, in 998 YK, there is a new Beggar Dane; an anonymous figure who speaks on behalf of the Swords of Liberty, a widespread network of insurgents who rail against the Brelish monarchy. Some believe that this Beggar Dane is a fictional figurehead, a mask that can be used by any cell leader. But the Sharn Inquisitive has done a deep investigation into the Swords of Liberty, and they are convinced that Beggar Dane is one person\u2014a mastermind who is coordinating the actions of the western Swords cells. The Inquisitive further believes that Beggar Dane is driving the increasingly violent actions of the Swords.",
												"The Swords of Liberty began as a peaceful political movement, calling for King Boranel to voluntarily cede power to the Brelish parliament. In 996 YK, a statement from Beggar Dane took credit for an attack on Castle Arakhain that left the east wing of the Winter Palace in flames. Over the last two years, the Swords of Liberty have struck at nobles across Breland, stating that there will be no peace until the aristocracy is dissolved. According to Beggar Dane, even that victory wouldn't mean the end of violence. Beggar Dane accuses King Boranel of betraying the Brelish people both by accepting the terms of the Treaty of Thronehold and providing shelter for Cyran refugees. Dane maintains that Breland could have easily won the Last War if its leaders had truly wished to do so; in certain tracts, he suggests that there is a conspiracy among all the Wyrnarn monarchs, that Boranel has intentionally misled his nation to benefit his royal cousins. He promises that once the monarchy is overthrown, the new army of the common people will bring unity to all of Khorvaire\u2014and that they will deal with both the \"monsters to the west\" (Droaam) and the \"enemy we have welcomed in\" (Cyrans).",
												"Beggar Dane's identity is a closely guarded secret. He's mainly known through the proclamations that supporters share in villages and farms. However, a masked figure claiming to be Beggar Dane has spoken at rallies and been seen during Swords attacks. According to these reports, he's a male human or half- elf; as he's masked and shielded against divination, little else is known. Beggar Dane is believed to be on the Western Frontier and there are many in the west who support his actions, even if they aren't willing to take up arms for his cause. Whether or not you've ever seen Beggar Dane, if you have been on the frontier for long, you've certainly heard of him.",
												"While there are some similarities between Beggar Dane and the Company of the Black Crown, the two are actually very different. The Black Crown are a force of brigands; they may avoid the law, but they don't hide who they are or what they're doing. By contrast, the Swords of Liberty are covert insurgents whose members are hidden in communities across Breland. The Black Crowns defy Brelish law, but they're interested in lining their pockets, not in driving political change; the Swords of Liberty are only interested in change, and every violent action they take advances that agenda.",

												"In a region where bandits are as common as copper pieces, the Company of the Black Crown have earned their infamy. The core of the company were members of an elite unit of Brelish soldiers stationed at Orcbone. Their captain, Breggan, regularly ignored her orders and waged her own personal guerrilla war against Droaam, slaughtering goblin villages and leaving gruesome displays that could chill even a medusa's blood. Some stories say that Breggan sought to avenge the slaughter of her own family at the hands of monstrous raiders. Others suggest that she admired the ferocity of her foes, that in seeking to match their cruelty she became a monster herself. One especially dramatic tale says that after losing an eye in a battle with a minotaur champion, she plucked out the eye of her fallen foe and pressed it into her own socket, so she could see the world as her enemies do. When she was finally called to account for her cruelty and violation of orders two years ago, she broke with Breland, and many of her soldiers followed her. Now she claims that she is a true daughter of Breggor Firstking, the founder of the ancient nation of Wroat, and that a vision from her ancestor guided her to find his black iron crown. She says that Boranel betrayed his people by failing to bring Droaam to heel, and that she is the champion of the abandoned people of the Western Frontier; she calls herself \"the Queen of the Lost,\" subject to the laws of no nation.",
												"Breggan Blackcrown is a human woman in her thirties, equally skilled with sword and wand. She's more than just a wandslinger; stories suggest she could be some sort of warlock. She's as charming as she is ruthless, and never underestimates a foe. Her success to date is no accident; Breggan is a brilliant leader and her soldiers are exceptionally loyal to her, willing to take any risk in her service. Her primary lieutenants are Dusker (female gnome, scout and assassin), her bodyguard, Blessing (nonbinary warforged, a heavily armored defensive fighter), and Sigil (male human, the war mage who maintains the company's artillery).",
												"The Company of the Black Crown is a mobile force trained in the techniques of guerilla warfare. They have a few Long Rods and other military-grade weapons. They ride the very edge of Droaam and Breland, defying both nations and preying on the people of both lands. They frequently target other brigands and clash with Droaamite raiders, and most believe that this is why the commander of Orcbone chooses to ignore them; others say that the commander is one of Breggan's former lovers, or that he doesn't want to send his soldiers to their deaths. Regardless, for now Orcbone isn't pursuing the Black Crowns.",
												"While the Black Crowns ruthlessly slaughter other brigands and raiders, they're no angels.

												"Ardev is the ancestral seat of the ir'Blis line. Thavius ir'Blis is the ruling count of the Western Frontier, formally styled as the Shield of the Graywall in recognition of his responsibility over this border region. In his youth, Thavius led troops on the northern front. Then came the Daughters of Sora Kell. In 986 YK, Countess Thalia ir'Blis (the mother of Thavius) personally led the Westwind Riders to deal with the forces that had claimed the town of Stubborn (now known as Stonejaw). The countess and all of her troops were killed, and the Daughters retaliated with a devastating attack on Orcbone. Thavius was called back to Ardev, both to assume the position of Count and to defend the west against this new threat. He didn't stand alone; King Boranel sent troops to reinforce this new front line. While these forces were necessary to defend the border against the unexpected power of Droaam, they were servants of the king, not the count. Thavius served with distinction both on the field of battle and as a commander, but he could only control the forces under his command and chafed at the poor decisions of the eastern soldiers. Breggan Blackcrown is a key example of this: The bandit queen originally served under Lord Veirner ir'Tajar of Orcbone, and Thavius holds ir'Tajar responsible both for Breggan's conduct during the war and her current brigandry. With the current de-escalation of hostilities, most of the royal forces have been withdrawn; but Lord Veirner has been retained as the Viscount of Orcbone, and Argonth has been assigned to the region.",
												"The ir'Blis line has governed this region since Galifar was founded. It has always been a vast and largely empty county; even before Droaam, the Barrens to the west were a dangerous, unclaimed land. The rise of Droaam as a nation has been a tremendous blow to the ir'Blis family. While it was largely undeveloped, they saw the Western Frontier as their domain. Now that land has been claimed by a new and powerful nation. Orcbone has been stripped from the domain and granted to an eastern noble\u2014and aside from his wounded pride, the count despises ir'Tajar. Quickstone has gone from being a backwater smuggler's haven to a boom town drawing in the dragonmarked houses. Count ir'Blis wants to do what's best for his people, but he is still trying to determine what that even is. He yearns for vengeance against Droaam and the Daughters of Sora Kell, but he recognizes that his people need peace\u2014and that there's no telling how a true war with Droaam would end.",
												"At the end of the day, Count Thavius ir'Blis is quintessentially Brelish. He is proud, but his pragmatism comes first. He upholds the law, but is willing to overlook the work of an honest smuggler; he knew what he was doing when he allowed the Three Faces of Coin to have a foothold in Quickstone. He showed charity to Cyran refugees, but he also placed them on the border with Droaam\u2014setting them between his own people and an unknown threat. Keep this in mind when dealing with the count: He is a soldier who has commanded troops in battle. He takes his station seriously. But above all, he is a practical man who does what's best for his people and his family. Count ir'Blis is largely respected by the people of the frontier. He is seen as a just man, from a family that's never been too heavy handed. But the people of the frontier are an independent lot. The Swords of Liberty are strong in this region; even if its members don't see the count as a villain, he is still a brick in a wall they're going to tear down.

Sometimes called the Goblin Prince, Kethelrax has been a rallying figure for people who have been oppressed throughout the history of the region. Kethelrax was born into one of the Khaar'paal kobold clans of the Graywall Mountains. Gifted with sorcerous power, these kobolds have largely remained in their fortified tunnels, ignoring both the humans to the east and the raiders to the west. Young Kethelrax was curious and keen to explore the western lands\u2014but soon after he ventured into the Barrens, he was taken prisoner by an ogre chib who dominated a village of kobolds and goblins. Kethelrax served this ogre for a time, learning the ways of the Barrens and his oppressed cousins. Before the Daughters exerted their influence over the land, the Barrens were violent and unstable; the ogre chib was in turn slain by minotaur raiders, who took Kethelrax and some of the others back with them to the fortress that was then known as Haalrac's Fist. Kethelrax had many opportunities to escape; he'd been honing his sorcerous talents throughout his time in the western lands, and his captors had no idea of what he was capable of. But Kethelrax wasn't content to escape alone. As a servant, he managed to manipulate the warrior Turakbar, playing on the minotaur's ego. Kethelrax convinced Turakbar to slaughter the reigning clan lord, Haalrac, and in the ensuing chaos, the kobold was able to free a host of goblins, kobolds, and others forced into service in Haalrac's Fist. Kethelrax led this band south, hoping he could convince the Khaar'paal to take in these refugees. But during the long journey, Kethelrax was visited by a blind hag who urged him to take shelter in some Dhakaani ruins in the foothills of the Graywall Mountains. Sora Teraza told Kethelrax that change was coming to the Barrens\u2014and that there was a need for a leader who could inspire the small folk of the Barrens, rallying goblins and kobolds alike. Over the next few years, Kethelrax and his band targeted weak chibs in the region, freeing their prisoners and building a significant force. It wasn't easy, and Kethelrax suffered a number of bloody defeats\u2014but he and his people remained strong. In 985 YK, Sora Katra came to Kethelrax.

His primary motive is always to improve the lives of the kobolds and goblins of the western plains, and this has led him to be one of the most trusted allies of the Daughters of Sora Kell. While some warlords chafe at the Daughters' rule and yearn for greater power, Kethelrax recognizes that a strong and united Droaam holds many opportunities for his people. He continues to improve Shaarat Kol, working to make it a haven for both smugglers and honest traders. With that said, he still has a number of old scores he'd like to settle with those chibs and warlords that have long oppressed the small folk. He has so far been unable to convince the Khaar'paal kobolds to ally with the Daughters, but he continues to work to win them over.",

He's known for his ability to conjure blades of flame (something that mimics both Flame Blade and Fire Bolt, as he can fling his fiery daggers).

The Kor'mur (\"Blood Horns\") interpretation of the Horned King is a tyrant who rules through bloodsoaked intimidation, and Turakbar follows this example. He revels in his role as a champion of dark powers. His horns and armor are engraved with glowing runes, and he enjoys crushing the life from his foes with his massive clawed gauntlet. But those who have met him can attest to the fact that he's more than just a bloodsoaked brute. Turakbar is surprisingly clever, and has a talent\u2014a gift of the Horned King\u2014for sensing the fears of others. He enjoys tormenting his foes and rivals, both physically and psychologically. While he's not the most powerful of the warlords of Droaam, Rhesh Turakbar may well be the most monstrous.",
												"The Kor'mur are the largest of the minotaur clans, and the Fist is a powerful fortress on the edge of Breland. Both led the Daughters of Sora Kell to appoint Turakbar as the warlord of the region, further establishing his dominance over the other clans. When the hostilities between Breland and Droaam were at their height, Rhesh Turakbar raided deep into Brelish territory, sowing terror and burning supplies. Today, Turakbar and his forces primarily patrol the border between Droaam and Breland, but they also regularly raid into Brelish territory. They generally remain north of Graywall, avoiding the main trade road\u2014but anything else is fair game. They rarely actually take anything in their raids, and they often wound or maim victims rather than killing them; their goal is fear, not plunder. The Daughters of Sora Kell claim that these raids are the fault of Breland for refusing to recognize Droaam and thus allowing for an absolute determination of borders; they say the violence is Breland's fault, both for settling too far west and for refusing to include Droaam in the Treaty of Thronehold.",

The Queen of Stone is a deadly warrior and brilliant general; over the last decade she led troops into battle on the Brelish front, and also helped the Daughters crush those who opposed their vision of a united Droaam. Cazhaak Draal is an integral part of that dream; the most powerful priests of the Dark Six are medusas, and medusa architects direct the construction of the booming cities of Droaam. Many of the magistrates and envoys of Katra's Voice are medusas. Sheshka knows all this. She works with the Daughters not because she fears their power, but because she truly believes that Droaam could become something great.

They're armed and armored in the fashion of the elves of Valenar, wielding a double- bladed scimitar with deadly skill. But Vael is no mercenary and accepts no payment from the people they aid. When asked why they're so far from their homeland or why they place themselves in danger to help strangers, Vael invariably responds \"I do what must be done.\" Some believe Vael has a definite purpose\u2014that they are searching for a rival, or waiting for an event that could be years in the future. Those more familiar with the Tairnadal say that Vael is likely following in the footsteps of their patron ancestors, that they may be emulating the deeds of an ancient champion of the common people. However, Vael will not speak of their ancestor, and while their armor has the traditional Tairnadal trappings that should identify a patron ancestor, no scholar on the frontier has ever been able to identify Vael's patron.",

It's also possible that you encountered the elf on the battlefields of the Last War, or that they assisted you at some point in your past; if you want to explore one of these ideas, discuss it with the DM.

										"There are few trappings of faith on the frontier. Churches aren't the gilded citadels you can find in Sharn or Flamekeep. The simple fact is that the people of Breland have always been cynical and pragmatic, never ones to believe that their destiny is in the hands of divine forces. And yet, on the frontier, you're far from the comfort and security that comes easily in the big cities, and there's a comfort to believing in something greater than yourself\u2014in believing that there is a higher power guiding or working through you, that you have been granted a divine gift or charged with a purpose. Beyond that, a shared faith helps hold a community together, which is important in a small village where everyone needs to depend on one another. The holidays of the Sovereign Host are described in chapter 3, and while celebrations may not be as grand as their counterparts in Fairhaven or Wroat, these feasts and festivals are often important to a community in a way they simply aren't in the east. The Sovereign Host is the dominant faith of the Brelish population, while the worship of the Dark Six\u2014particularly the interpretation known as the Cazhaak Six\u2014is a common faith within Droaam.",
										"However, especially within Droaam, there are a host of lesser traditions. The minotaurs of Turakbar's Fist are devoted to the fiend they call the Horned King. The gnolls of the Znir Pact refuse to bow to any god or demon; in place of shrines, they raise piles of stones to represent the idols shattered by their ancestors, and they stare at these cairns and meditate upon their freedom. In general, the people are indulgent of the beliefs of others, even if they don't like them. The Znir gnoll despises fiends, but they'll still work with a warlock-priest of the Horned King if the pay is good. In Quickstone, House Orien knows the Khaar'paal kobolds that work for them worship the Dark Six and hold revels to the Fury, but they're also really good at placing conductor stones, and that's what matters most. People of conflicting faiths may not trust or like one another, but that doesn't stop them from ever working together.",
										"As is common across Khorvaire, it's important to remember that most priests serving in churches and shrines don't have the powers of a Cleric or Paladin. Many are adepts (divine Magewrights) who can cast Thaumaturgy, Ceremony (from Xanathar's Guide to Everything), and perhaps one other cantrip or ritual\u2014such as Light, Spare the Dying, or Augury. The role of the priest is to offer spiritual guidance to the community, to preach and to organize the local festivals. There are some remarkable priests who do possess greater powers\u2014Vesper in Quickstone, Zerasha in Graywall\u2014but that's not what people expect from their priests. You go to the Jorasco healer if you need someone to heal an injury; you go to a priest of the Sovereign Host when you need someone to lift your spirits. So priests are often influential people within their communities, but they aren't always powerful spellcasters. As a Paladin or a Cleric, you're a champion of your faith granted the power to face challenges a village priest cannot, and they ask you to deal with problems that threaten their community.",

												"The Sovereign Host is the common faith of Breland, and this is certainly true on the frontier. Every major town has a church dedicated to the Sovereign Host, and even some of the villages have churches or small shrines where the faithful can pay their respects. Generally, people worship the pantheon as a whole, offering their prayers and thanks to whichever of the Sovereigns is most relevant to the challenges they're facing at the moment. However, some towns or individuals feel a particular strong connection to a specific sovereign. The town of Shavalant considers Balinor to be its personal patron, while Ardev has a popular shrine devoted to Boldrei. A blacksmith may honor all the Sovereigns in their moment, but still believe that it is Onatar's voice that speaks the loudest.",
												"While the Sovereigns can affect the world as a whole\u2014Arawai brings gentle rains, Olladra grants the gift of good fortune\u2014the Sovereigns primarily affect the world by guiding the faithful. Dol Dorn doesn't cause wars, but he will lend his strength to any soldier who trusts in him. It's the smith who forges a blade, vbut Onatar can guide the smith's hand. Some people offer sacrifices to the Sovereigns in moments of great need, but such sacrifices need not have a physical component. A typical sacrifice is a vow\u2014a promise to take some action that honors the Sovereign. This could be a pilgrimage or a prayer, but it can also be more abstract. A scholar struggling with a problem might make a vow to Aureon that if the Sovereign can offer new insight, the sage will finally finish the book they've been putting off\u2014a fitting vow to the Sovereign of knowledge and learning. A warrior who's outnumbered in battle may promise Dol Arrah that if they live through the encounter, they will help the next person they see facing impossible odds in a fight. The primary role of a Vassal priest is to teach people to hear the voices of the Sovereigns within themselves, to realize that the Sovereigns are with them at all times, always ready to lend a hand.",
												"The priesthood of the Sovereign Host isn't as strictly structured as that of the Church of the Silver Flame; many priests are self-taught, especially on the frontier. What matters is your faith and that the people of your community believe in your connection to the Sovereigns. In the village of Cooper Shrine on Silver Lake, the priest Mala Cooper wasn't ordained in a grand temple. But she has tended the shrine since she was a child, and the people of Silver Lake believe that she is blessed. Because of this, priests are dependent on their community to maintain their church, and any Vassal who has unexpected good fortune will usually make a donation.",
												"As noted above, the festivals of the Sovereign Host are important events in the Brelish towns and villages. Often, people in small villages and farms will travel to the nearest town for a celebration, but people can also just celebrate Bounty's Blessing with the largest meal they can produce at their home. The point of a festival is to affirm shared faith and the bonds between a community, and this is something to keep in mind when playing a Vassal character. The Sovereigns speak to you directly, offering you personal guidance. But Boldrei tells you that people are stronger together. Dol Arrah urges you to defend those who cannot defend themselves. In playing a Vassal, keep in mind that it's not just a question of what the Sovereigns can do for you; it's about the connection you have with others through your shared faith. If you find a goblin treasure trove, will you give thanks to Olladra and share this windfall with your local priest? Or do you only turn to the Sovereigns when you need something from them?",

														"The Three Faces are a set of mystery cults hidden within the Five Nations. In addition to the Three Faces of Coin, there are also cults dedicated to the Three Faces of Love, the Three Faces of War, and the Three Faces of the Wild. Each of these cults worship a small combination of members of the Sovereign Host and the Dark Six, who together represent a portfolio. While they are secretive organizations, they're called \"mystery cults\" because they possess secret knowledge that they only share with their initiates. While they are religious organizations, they are also fraternities that unite people who have talents within a certain field\u2014people who, through their success, have shown that they are blessed by one or more of the three faces. So, not every soldier is invited to join the Three Faces of War. If you're tapped by a member of the cult, it's because the initiates recognize through your skills and accomplishments that you are blessed by one of the three\u2014and they believe that you can understand the central mystery, which is that war has more than one face, and that honor, courage, and cunning all have a place on the battlefield. Initiates are bound together by the secret knowledge they possess and their shared understanding of the world, but the Three Faces cults don't have any sort of sinister agenda; it's a bond of fellowship. A Thrane and a Karrn who are both members of the Three Faces of War will fight one another on the battlefield, and two merchants in the Three Faces of Coin will still engage in fierce haggling, because that is what they do; but between these battles, when they share the words of their three, they know that they understand the same mysteries and have a shared understanding of how the world works, and that they have both been deemed to be blessed by the three. So you can certainly have a player character be a member of a Three Faces cult; there's nothing inherently evil about them. Essentially, there's no reason that membership in the Three Faces has to be hidden, aside from the fact that outsiders can't understand the mysteries.",
														"While the Three Faces cults believe that all three of their Sovereigns work together, initiates are chosen because they are perceived to be blessed by one of the three. So the Three Faces of Coin govern the \"battlefield\" of commerce and industry, the struggle to get the things that we desire. Onatar guides those who create the goods people desire, Kol Korran inspires those who trade in the light, and Kol Turrant guides those who work in the shadows. You should always be able to get the things you desire, but you should always pay a fair price for what you receive. All people should have a path to profit, provided they are willing to work for it. These are the tenets of the Three Faces of Coin. An honest blacksmith should always be able to profit from their hard labor, and someone who wishes to purchase the smith's goods should have a way to do so\u2014even if that requires them to work with a \"Pennyroyal,\" someone favored by the Keeper. Coins (the casual term for initiates of the sect) don't inherently oppose trade laws; they simply believe that there should always be a way around them for those prepared to work for it. The honest merchant may never deal with a Pennyroyal, but they know that they could. The information that follows reveals some of the mysteries of the Three Faces of Coin; these aren't absolute secrets, but if you're not part of the cult, you likely don't know these things.",
														"The dark side of the Three Faces of Coin is reflected by their embracing Kol Turrant. The Pyrinean Creed says that the Keeper is the Sovereign of Greed. The Coins understand that in the right time and place, greed can be good\u2014that it is better to understand it and use it than to run from it. Everyone wants things. Everyone who creates wants people to want those things they create. The Coins say that there's nothing wrong with that desire and there's nothing wrong with bending the rules to get what you want, as long as you are willing to pay a fair price. Fair payment is a central pillar of this faith: People deserve to be paid for good work. As such, the Three Faces of Coin are one of the only religious sects that is openly willing to sell the spells of its divine spellcasters. The spell is a commodity; if you want it, you should pay for it. This doesn't mean that as a Coin cleric you HAVE to charge your companions when you cast a spell; but it means that you recognize that your magic has value, that you could charge for it, and that if you are choosing to give this as a gift to a friend, they'd better appreciate it! Those blessed by Kol Turrant\u2014the Pennyroyals\u2014walk a crooked line. The classic Pennyroyal is a smuggler or a fence\u2014someone who dodges the laws in order to get people the things they desire. However, Pennyroyals also include grifters, pickpockets, and thieves. This follows the principle that you should always be able to get the things that you desire\u2014it just skirts the point of paying a fair price (though the thief should be paid a fair price for their services). Ultimately, this comes to the point that it's up to you to decide which of the three paths you will walk. You can choose to only follow the path of Kol Korran and to engage in honest commerce; but as a follower of the Three Faces of Coin, you recognize your comrade's right to step into the shadows when they can't get what they desire in the light.",
														"The holy symbol of the Three Faces of Coin is three coins. When someone is initiated into the sect, they receive three special coins: a copper coin with the dracolich profile of Kol Turrant, a silver coin with a brass dragon for Onatar, and a gold coin with a white dragon profile for Kol Korran. While these coins are treasures, any spread of copper-silver-gold can be used as a signal. This is also the origin of the term Pennyroyal, as the copper coin of the Keeper is sometimes called a penny; \"Penny Royal'' thus means \"Keeper's Chosen.\"",
														"The Three Faces of Coin can be found across Khorvaire and on the frontier, but you likely won't notice them if you aren't an initiate. The exception to this is in the town of Quickstone. A contingent of Coins banded together to help found the town, and they make up a significant portion of the population; as a result, they are a little more open with their faith than usual. However, they still won't share their mysteries with you unless you've been blessed by one of the Three; they just aren't shy about acknowledging their beliefs."

That the Devourer sends the storms that can level your farm and your fields, and that the Shadow creates the monsters that will come for you. With that said, the Brelish are both cynical and pragmatic. There are some who are willing to bargain with the Six if it gets them the things that they desire\u2014whether that's burning a field as a sacrifice to the Devourer so he'll spare the other fields, or shooting a man in the back because they know they can't beat him in a fair fight.

This is the basis of the Three Faces cults, who are willing to see both sides\u2014to embrace Dol Arrah and the Mockery, or Kol Korran and the Keeper. Overall, however, the Brelish settlers still shun the Dark Six and curse them when things go wrong. The fact that the Droaamites honor the Six is proof to the Brelish that they're dangerous.

														"Droaam is a tapestry of many microcultures. Step back a century and what you'll find is that many of these cultures worshiped various configurations of the Dark Six, but didn't use common names for them or acknowledge the full grouping. The harpies of the Byeshk Mountains worshiped the Song of Rage and Fury, while the Gaa'aram orcs invoked the Bloody Knife; anyone listening to their stories could recognize the shape of the Fury and the Mockery, but the harpies had no knowledge of or interest in the Bloody Knife. This changed because of the efforts of the medusas of Cazhaak Draal, whose missionaries traveled across the Barrens. Few people want to pick a fight with a medusa, so these missionaries were able to share their stories. This had a syncretic aspect, very similar to the way in which the Pyrinean Creed wove the faiths of the Shadow Marches and Talenta Plains into the Sovereign Host; the Cazhaak Missionaries were able to show the harpies that the Song of Rage and Fury was the force they called the Fury, and convince the Gaa'aram that the Bloody Knife was the Mockery.",
														"The most important effects of this missionary work were creating a common language for discussing faith and presenting the idea that these deities that had existed in isolation were part of a unified pantheon. In the present day, the harpies still revere the Fury above all others, but this is the same way that a Vassal blacksmith values their connection with Onatar over the other Sovereigns; they still know that the Fury is part of the greater pantheon, and may invoke other members of the Six when the situation calls for it. The diverse beliefs of Droaam still persist; if you go to the Street of Shadows in Graywall, you'll find a shrine to the First Song and one to the Howl\u2014two different interpretations of the Fury worshiped by different harpy flights. But these traditions are unified by the underlying structure of the Cazhaak faith. Most Droaamites recognize the Shadow as the patron of all monsters, the source of the harpy's voice and the medusa's gaze, and priests of the Shadow are respected by all; the harpy who sings a prayer at the Shrine of the Song will continue on to the Eye of the Shadow to ask the priest Zerasha for guidance.",
														"The general practices of the Dark Six are presented in Exploring Eberron. The primary point is that what the followers of the Sovereign Host see as evil, the followers of the Cazhaak Six see as virtues. The Fury guides the faithful through primal instincts, and grants justice in the form of vengeance. The Mockery shows you the path to victory; what sensible warrior would choose an honorable death over a cunning victory? The Shadow will help you achieve your full potential, even if that means walking paths that others fear. The Cazhaak faith acknowledges that the Sovereigns exist, but it considers them to be weak powers who have somehow tricked their followers. The Vassals say that the Shadow is evil because it creates medusas and harpies; the medusa and the harpy say don't blame us if your gods aren't willing to give you such powers.",

So why then do they call the Sovereign of these forces \"the Mockery?\" The simple answer is that they don't. Keep in mind that the Common tongue is the language of the east; the Droaamites primarily speak Goblin, and they have different words for everything. They understand that the Mockery is the Common translation and the name the easterners will understand, so they are willing to use it when speaking Common. And likewise, we use those names in this book because it's the simplest approach. Adding a new set of Goblin titles for the Six creates an unnecessary layer of complication. It's simpler to just call the Fury \"the Fury'' than to introduce \"Niianu'aram\" as a new name for her. So we refer to the Mockery as the Mockery even when using the Cazhaak interpretation; but that's the common name, and it doesn't reflect how followers of"

In 870 YK, the Church of the Silver Flame established Brightstone Keep in the Barrens as a foothold to watch for lycanthropes and fiends. While initially strongly garrisoned, the keep was stripped of most of its troops and resources when the Last War broke out. Brightstone Keep withstood a host of attacks from Barrens chibs, but it was seized by Droaamite forces in 986 YK, shortly after they claimed Stubborn.

Brelish settlers are often suspicious, both of the idea that anyone could have entirely altruistic motives and because mebbe they're spies fer Thrane. Epitaph and the other missionaries are working to counter these suspicions with noble acts, and also to learn about the people of Droaam\u2014but there's a long road ahead to win support for the Flame.",
												"If you're playing a character with ties to the Silver Flame, consider whether you have connections to the Church. If you do, you could be an independent missionary, or you could be working on behalf of Minister Faldren of Ardev. On the other hand, you could also be a local who has heard the call of the Silver Flame without having any connection to Flamekeep. This could be especially interesting for a Droaamite character\u2014a harpy who has received visions from the Flame and seeks to protect the innocent, who might not immediately realize they're channeling the same power as the arrogant easterners. A uniquely Droaamite option would be that you might be a potential Voice of the Flame\u2014a Tira Miron for the denizens of Droaam, perhaps empowered to protect your people and stop the Horned King from being released"

												"The Cults of the Dragon Below are as active in Droaam as they are in the Five Nations. The daelkyr destroyed the goblin empire long before humanity arrived, and their cults are as much of a threat to the people of Droaam as they are the Breland. The gnolls of the Znir Pact broke their ties to the fiendish overlords that created them, but there are others who are happy to seize the powers they abandoned.",
												{

													"name": "Fiendish Cults",

														"The denizens of Droaam don't have the same negative reaction to demons as many of the people of the east. The Shadow teaches that you may have to walk dark and dangerous paths to achieve your full potential, and many Cazhaak sages question the 'arbitrary' distinction between celestial and fiend. Because of this, there are many more warlocks than wizards in Droaam\u2014though it's worth noting that a warlock drawing power from an evil entity can use that power for noble purposes. However, such warlocks are often individuals walking their own unique paths.",
														"The most significant and infamous cult in Droaam is that of the Horned King, a demon overlord of the first age who is imprisoned within the region. \"The Horned King\" is the most common translation of the Goblin term Vor'marhu, but some people translate it as \"Horned Prince;\" both titles refer to the overlord Tol Kharash. The Horned King has long been a patron of the minotaur clans of the eastern Barrens, and the warlord Rhesh Turakbar is a champion of this archfiend. This cult is well established in Droaam, and the minotaurs have followed this path for centuries. It's widely known that the Horned King grants power to those who spill blood and sow terror in his name, and while many Droaamites don't like Rhesh Turakbar, most don't see his choice as any different than an eastern paladin who draws divine power from the Silver Flame; both have made a sacrifice that grants them power. The Znir Pact is a notable exception to this. They do understand the difference between a celestial and a fiend, and understand that this isn't just a semantic point. Znir demon-hunters will help those threatened by fiends and even perform exorcisms. But as with all Znir, the hwyri are mercenaries who only act when their services are requested and paid for. It's not the place of the Znir to prevent Turakbar and the minotaurs from making whatever pacts that they wish to; but the hwyri stand ready to bring down the corrupted warriors should the Daughters order it.",
														"The Horned King is the common name of the overlord and the aspect worshiped by Rhesh Turakbar and his clan, the Blood Horns; they raid and pillage in his name. However, each of the major minotaur clans has their own unique interpretation of the Horned King. The Red Hooves are devoted to He Who Walks Behind, and prefer sly ambushes to the howling assaults of the Blood Horns. The Blade Breaker clan worships One Horn, who rewards displays of strength and courage. While the Blade Breakers are just as aggressive as the Blood Horns, they are less brutal; it's just possible that while they think One Horn is an aspect of the Horned King, they are in truth drawing on a different power\u2014perhaps, the essence of Dol Dorn. If you wish to play a character tied to the Horned King or another overlord, the main question is whether you see your overlord as an ally dealing fairly with you\u2014granting you power for spilling blood in their name\u2014or if you have actually broken your ties with your cult and now use that power against them."

														"The daelkyr pose just as much a threat to the Daughters of Sora Kell and the denizens of Droaam as they do to the Five Nations. The one constant in the actions of the daelkyr is change\u2014changing how people think, transforming them physically, tearing down whatever order exists. There are no known widespread cults of the Dragon Below on the frontier, and the Daughters of Sora Kell would likely destroy any they discovered. But the daelkyr certainly have influence within the region, and anywhere that they have power a cult can appear. The Still Lord, Orlassk, is said to have cursed the Stonelands around Cazhaak Draal and may have created the first gargoyles and medusas, though neither species serves him today. Some scholars believe that it was the influence of Avassh\u2014the Twister of Roots\u2014that forced the ancient nations to devastate the Barrens and create the regions known as dead lands. And it's possible that Dyrrn the Corruptor's masterstroke against the Empire of Dhakaan was launched within the Graywall Mountains. So there are no KNOWN cults on the frontier, but you never know what you will find in your adventures."

												"Many faiths rare to the Five Nations are all but unknown on the frontier. Most of the other faiths are tied to specific cultures that simply aren't represented in the region. It's always possible that you'll discover an unexpected sect or shrine in your adventures\u2014a remote farm maintained by a group of Kalashtar, an Aereni monastery supporting a deathless sage\u2014but that would be a remarkable event. In general, following one of the other faiths is an opportunity for your character to stand out in the region. If you're a Warden of the Wood, you're not just a Warden, you're the Warden; what drove you to cross the Byeshk Mountains? Are you hoping to start a new circle of Wardens in Droaam? Were you given a special quest by Oalian\u2014perhaps a seed to plant in the Whitehorn Wood? Or are you just following your instincts and seeing where they lead you?",
												"The Blood of Vol has no established shrines on the frontier, but there are rumors that there's a community of Seekers in Graywall... though such Seekers are likely in Graywall because they're war criminals or deserters, so if you're a Seeker you'll have to decide if you actually want to seek out your fellows. It's also the case that most people on the frontier equate the Blood of Vol with Karrnath. Droaamites won't care, and while they don't have a strong tradition of necromancy, they revere the Shadow and the Keeper; they have no issues with the pursuit of \"dark magic.\" But Brelish veterans may have heard of the necromantic terror attacks Karrnath occasionally launched during the war, or the stories of skeletal legions, and hold that against you.",
												"The Eldeen Druid Sects are rare in Droaam, as suggested above. The people of the frontier generally don't know the difference between a Warden of the Wood or a Greensinger, and have no experience with Children of Winter. Shavalant was attacked by Ashbound during the Last War, and the people of that town are generally suspicious of all druids. The Gatekeepers, however, are a different story. The people of Breland know nothing about the Gatekeepers or their mission, but House Tharashk has considerable influence in Droaam, and there are at least some within the house who are sympathetic to the Gatekeepers and their mission. Likewise, there are certainly many places in Droaam that were touched by the daelkyr; there may well be daelkyr seals in the Graywall Mountains, or even below the Great Crag. If you are playing a Gatekeeper, work with your DM to decide if you have a specific mission\u2014finding and reinforcing a seal, locating an elder Gatekeeper who's gone missing, investigating reports of a daelkyr cult\u2014or if you are following your own path. Not all denizens of Droaam will know who you are or what you represent, but some will and they may be sympathetic to your cause.",
												"A final unusual faith unique to the region is the Maze of Faith, the priesthood of the Venomous Demesne. However, this religion is all but unknown beyond the Demesne and the tieflings have no interest in converting others to their faith. More information about this tradition can be found in chapter 1, but it's possible to encounter a tiefling priest carrying their own personal god while wandering the frontier."

Seekers are driven by curiosity, and love seeing new places and learning new things. Guardians devote themselves to protecting a person, place, or concept. Movers enjoy motion itself\u2014flight, fighting, dancing\u2014and often become scouts or soldiers. Thinkers are rarely seen, because they have the least reason to actually move; they live to ponder philosophies and ideas. A statue in a temple or a library could be a gargoyle priest or sage, lost in contemplation."

But there are no rules that make a wandslinger's choice of weapon matter\u2014there is no mechanical difference between using a Wand or a Staff. However, the 2024 version of the fifth edition Player's Handbook introduces Weapon Masteries\u2014properties that reflect the full potential of a weapon, which can be unlocked by a skilled combatant. Adding Mastery properties to Arcane Focuses is a way to embrace the concept that Wands and the like are weapons in Eberron and to provide a distinct flavor to each focus. With these rules, the Wand is swift and vexing, the Rod staggers a target with brute force, and the Staff shoves them back with the power of its blast.",
