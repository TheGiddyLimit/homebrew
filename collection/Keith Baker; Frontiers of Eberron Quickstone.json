						"Five Nations. Secrets of Sarlona. Most canonical Eberron sourcebooks focus on broad concepts or regions\u2014continents, nations, the Last War. Sharn: City of Towers focuses on the greatest city in Khorvaire. In the wake of Exploring Eberron, I knew I wanted to do something different\u2014to dive deeper into a smaller region, picking an interesting point on the map where a group of adventurers could make a difference, and where they could see a town prosper (or fail!) because of their actions. I wanted to explore stories on the edge of the map instead of at the heart of it. But knowing that I wanted to tell stories on a frontier, the question was which frontier? Because in 998 YK, there are a number of interesting choices. Aundair and the Eldeen Reaches. The shard rush in Q'barra. Darguun. All of these were solid options. But ultimately, I love the nation of Droaam. I love looking at creatures that are traditionally classified as monsters and imagining the nation they could build working together. And so this book explores the region that lies between the established human kingdom of Breland and the new, rising nation of Droaam. The opportunity drawing people here isn't gold or even dragonshards. It's Droaam itself, a young nation that is coming into its own. I knew I wanted to tell a tale that draws on classic western tropes, where you could play a warforged sheriff, a small-town preacher, a retired Sentinel Marshal with skeletons in his past. But I loved that this is a place where the Ranger could be a worg and where the Bard might be a harpy\u2014where the classic fantasy elements of Breland mingle with the monstrous denizens of Droaam.",
						"Quickstone began as an adventure\u2014a starting point for characters that wasn't Sharn or Stormreach. As we explored the story, I realized that I wanted to take it further, exploring the entire region and the stories we could tell there. As it turned out, the road to Quickstone was long and hard, filled with random encounters and unexpected challenges. I appreciate the hard work of everyone who's helped us reach the end of this journey. Wayne Chang kept the project moving forward, with help from Sumeet Vats in the final stretch. Imogen Gingell brought the adventure \"Heart of Stone\" to life, as well as developing subclasses, feats, monsters, and treasures. Luke Volker refined our writing and made sure we were in line with the revised rules in the 2024 version of the fifth edition Player's Handbook, while Sam Sorensen put all the pieces together. A host of artists contributed to the book, and I'm grateful to Carolina Cesario, Matthew Johnson, Julio Azevedo, GAOZ, Vincentius Matthew, Sylverryn, Jonathan Ng, Alexandra Coggon, Olie Bollador, and Eldon Cowgur for giving us a vision of the Western Frontier\u2014and especially to Thomas Bourdon for his amazing cover and to Marco Bernardini for his incredible map of Quickstone. Marco completed this map in 2021, and I'm so happy to finally share it with the world.",
						"But there's another group of people to thank. It's taken a long time to finish the book, but for the last few years I've been running a campaign set in Quickstone for my patrons. Hundreds of people have contributed time and energy toward shaping Quickstone, and many of the NPCs you'll find here are drawn from that campaign. So thanks to everyone who has been a part of Quickstone\u2014and to you for exploring it now. And thanks to my partner Jennifer Ellis for walking from Quickstone to Silver Lake with me.",
						"As always, this book is a vision of Eberron as I run it at my table. You may find details that don't align precisely with previous sourcebooks. It's up to you to decide which version to use\u2014or to use both as inspiration for your own ideas! From the beginning, we wanted Eberron to inspire people to create their own stories. So welcome to the Frontier\u2014I hope you'll make it your own!",

						"When people think about adventures in Eberron, they often think of distant and legendary locations\u2014the jungles of Xen'drik, the dragon-realms of Argonnessen, the hidden lands of Sarlona. Others look to the great cities of Sharn, Korth, or Fairhaven, metropolises teeming with people. But there is adventure to be had in the cracks between the great cities and distant lands. In the wake of the Last War, new nations have broken away from the yoke of Galifar, and this has created a host of unique frontiers and untapped opportunities. West of Breland, a number of different cultures have joined together as the nation of Droaam. The medusas of Cazhaak Draal have opened their stone gates, the tieflings of the Venomous Demesne have emerged from their hidden kingdom, and the infamous Daughters of Sora Kell stand above it all. Breland and the other Thronehold nations have refused to recognize Droaam\u2014and this, in turn, means that Droaam isn't obliged to respect the laws and traditions of the nations of the east. And it further means that the border between Droaam and Breland is largely a theoretical concept. This has left a wide swath of land where no one truly holds sway\u2014where each village must stand ready to defend itself from brigands and raiders, where Brelish and Droaamite may dwell side by side, where Cannith goods can be found alongside the arcane creations of the Venomous Demesne. It's a region filled with ancient ruins, some of which have been shunned for centuries\u2014often with good reason. And it is a region filled with expanding cities and newborn hamlets, where people have come in search of opportunity in spite of the danger. This is the Western Frontier.",
						"All the themes of Eberron\u2014the concepts discussed in Eberron: Rising from the Last War\u2014are in play on the frontier. There is opportunity for pulp adventure, for fighting demon-fueled champions in ancient Dhakaani ruins or racing to stop nefarious cultists from releasing the deadly daelkyr. And there's room for noir intrigue, for schemes driven by petty greed and human weakness. The impact of the Last War can be felt here, as veterans and refugees settle in unclaimed lands and war criminals and deserters from the east hide from justice. But there are other themes that are unique to this time and place. This is an opportunity to explore the shifting balance between Droaam and Breland, to find mysteries in towns too small to show up on any map, to bring justice to places where it's long been forgotten. So strap on your wand and saddle up the tribex\u2014Quickstone awaits.",

								"In the distant past, the lands west of Breland were a vibrant part of the goblin Empire of Dhakaan. The Six Kings monument on the northern edge of the Graywall Mountains commemorates the founding of this empire. At that time, the region was prosperous and fertile, and networks of roads and tunnels connected a host of Dhakaani towns and cities. That golden age was torn down by the daelkyr. The Xoriat Incursion wasn't a single focused invasion. It was a series of waves, each stronger and deadlier than the last. Orlaask, Avassh, and Dyrrn sank their tendrils into the region and spread corruption and chaos. Some of these were straightforward, physical conflicts\u2014hordes of dolgaunts and dolgrims supported by mind flayers and beholders clashing with disciplined Dhakaani legions. Others were more subtle, such as Avassh's creation of rageweed, a swiftly spreading plant whose pollen causes hallucinations and enhances aggression in bugbears and hobgoblins. It's not known with certainty who caused the environmental damage, but historical records show that the region now known as the Barrens was once verdant and fertile. It could be that it was the daelkyr Avassh who drained the life from the soil... or it may be that the Dhakaani themselves devastated the land in a desperate, pyrrhic effort to contain the threat posed by the daelkyr. Ultimately, the Daelkyr were defeated, but the damage was irreparable. The psychic wounds inflicted by the daelkyr festered, and civil war, chaotic upheavals, and lingering aberrations and monstrosities tore the empire apart. Within two centuries, the Barrens were a dusty region of haunted ruins. Bugbears and hobgoblins were nearly eradicated. Goblins remained, but they were soon subjugated by the scavengers and predators that emerged from the shadows\u2014feral gnolls, hungry trolls, cruel minotaurs, and far worse things. And the daelkyr aren't the only deadly powers in this place. There is an overlord bound beneath the Barrens, a force that thrives on brutal tyranny. This Horned King fueled the cruelty of the chibs, petty chieftains engaged in endless feuds. Over time, islands of civilization arose in this sea of chaos... The Venomous Demesne. The Znir Pact. The hidden changelings of Lost. The harpies of the high peaks. But these forces remained isolated and all but unknown to the people of the east, who saw only the violence of the chibs and the monstrosities roaming freely.",
								"With the rise of Galifar, Breland laid claim to all the lands west of Silver Lake. But this was just a word written on a map. Throughout the history of Galifar, there were only a handful of Brelish towns west of the Graywall Mountains. The largest of these was the town of Stubborn, which has since become Graywall; the Church of the Silver Flame established Brightstone Keep, which has since become Grimstone. But between the harsh nature of the land and the chaotic aggression of its inhabitants, the rulers of Galifar never considered it worth the effort to fully subjugate it.",
								"Centuries passed. New civilizations arose in the Barrens; the rise of the medusa city-state of Cazhaak Draal went entirely unnoticed by the people of the east. The region was simply a land of monsters, a place for eager templars to venture on bold quests. The denizens of the region were seen as too chaotic to pose any sort of serious threat to Galifar, and the Barrens had nothing of value. Then came the Last War. Galifar shattered into five nations. And along the edges of Khorvaire new nations seized the opportunity. The Mror dwarves declared independence. The Tairnadal elves and Ghaal'dar goblins laid claim to Valenar and Darguun. And in 986 YK, the Daughters of Sora Kell sacked the city of Stubborn and issued an ultimatum to the survivors. {@i \"Tell your rulers there's a new power in the west,\"} Sora Katra told the people of Stubborn. {@i \"What you've called the Barrens, we now name Droaam. The land beyond the Graywall and below the Byeshk belongs to our people. Withdraw yours quickly and respect our claim; next time, there will be no survivors.\"}",
								"The next decade saw a series of dramatic conflicts between Brelish soldiers under the leadership of Count ir'Blis and Droaamite forces. Breland struck at Turakbar's Fist. Droaamites razed villages around Orcbone. The struggle came to an end with the Mourning. As the nations of Khorvaire came together to craft the Treaty of Thronehold, the Daughters of Sora Kell sought a seat at the table. Their petition was denied. The people of the east wouldn't accept a nation of monsters; they were certain it would collapse within a few years. But in 998 YK, Droaam is stronger than ever... and people know it. The dragonmarked houses smell opportunity. Tharashk has found dragonshards and other valuable resources. Brelish nobles are offering veterans and refugees land in this region, drawing a new wave of settlers.",

The Barrens were once an important part of the Dhakaani empire, and there are fragments of the fallen civilization spread across the region. It's possible to find Dhakaani structures that are still intact, from small watchtowers to fortress cities like Cazhaak Draal or Shaarat Kol. But more often, adventurers will encounter remnants of structures destroyed by war and the passage of time, like the chunk of an ancient wall in the town of Quickstone. Keep in mind that Dhakaani architecture usually involved subterranean structures; what appears to be a devastated ruin could have intact vaults extending deep into the earth. And these in turn could have vile spores of Avassh, gargoyle servants of Orlassk, or other relics of the forces that destroyed Dhakaan. And finally, the Barrens holds a host of more recent ghost towns\u2014villages built by Brelish settlers and abandoned in response to the rise of Droaam, or chib camps abandoned under the new order. The Barrens are vast and largely uncharted. When adventurers find a massive Dhakaani statue half-buried, or a demonglass shrine\u2014are they the first people to stumble upon this wonder in the course of centuries?

										"As a player character becomes wealthy and powerful, they may find some of the stories on the frontier to be less compelling. A 15th level Wizard with a purse full of diamonds won't have much trouble with a band of basic brigands. There are a few ways to handle this. The first is to shift rewards. \"Heart of Stone,\" the adventure included in this book, can carry characters to 5th level. This makes them quite capable by the standards of the Western Frontier. Moving forward, the DM could reduce XP rewards, cutting them by 50-75%; the characters will continue to advance, but slowly. Likewise, they may receive less gold than is typically assigned to the challenges they overcome. The point isn't to penalize the adventurers\u2014it's to give them different rewards. Rather than raw currency, rewards can be favors, improved reputation, useful magic items\u2014whether that's an experimental potion, a Dhakaani adamantine blade, or a golden fiddle from the Merchant of Misthaven\u2014or, potentially, Epic Boons or Supernatural Gifts. Adventurers who shatter Orlassk's cursed altar might receive a Supernatural Gift without explanation; is it a gift from the archfey King Grayfinger, a show of gratitude for cleansing the stone? Or is it the first manifestation of Orlassk's \"blessing\"\u2014which might soon become a curse?",
										"Once again, the goal isn't to deny the characters a sense of accomplishment or advancement. The point is that, as the economy of the Western Frontier operates at a lower level than Sharn or Fairhaven, the adventurers don't need a lot of gold for it to be significant. Likewise, they should feel that they are gaining useful things because of their victories\u2014but those can be favors or blessings rather than the ability to cast 7th level spells.",
										"This is an option, but it's not the only one. If a DM wants to run a higher level campaign on the Western Frontier, the challenges faced by the adventurers can evolve to match their power. Fiends could manifest through Rhesh Turakbar's Demonglass Warriors. Mordain the Fleshweaver could unleash deadly threats tailored specifically to challenge the adventurers. Orlassk could unleash a Stoneborn Tarrasque. These sorts of threats will certainly shift the tone of the campaign, but there are ways to challenge high-level characters."

A more severe injury could result in the loss of all or part of a limb; remember that Eberron: Rising from the Last War has Prosthetic Limbs! But scars don't have to be physical. A character could have a traumatic reaction to the source of their defeat; going forward, they suffer Disadvantage on ability checks or attack rolls directly related to the person or creature that scarred them. The damage could be to their reputation, as word of the defeat spreads and wherever they go, people bring up the story.

Bartering is a common practice in Droaamite daily life. Droaamite miners often trade using small chunks of precious metal or uncut gemstones. Droaamites also gamble and barter with bounty-marked teeth. The Daughters of Sora Kell offer bounties on certain dangerous creatures, paid for by the tooth. A Goblin symbol identifying the animal it's from is carved on each tooth, but most merchants won't accept teeth unless they personally recognize the tooth\u2014so you can't just carve \"wyvern\" on wolf teeth. While the DM could treat bounty-marked teeth as another form of coinage\u2014\"the old goblin offers three displacer beast teeth, worth 10 silver pieces\"\u2014adventurers who kill a dangerous monstrosity might wonder what the bounty is for their teeth. The DM could roll on the Individual Treasure tables in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide to determine the bounty offered for a creature of any CR. However, the tooth currency is based on the value the Daughters have placed on each bounty, and not every creature has a golden mouth. Some dangerous creatures might have a high value, while others are worthless. The bounty is a way to encourage the elimination of threats, and if a creature doesn't threaten the people of Droaam\u2014or is perhaps even an ally\u2014there won't be a bounty on its teeth. The people of the Venomous Demesne have their own forms of currency, including vials of blood charged with arcane energy and shards of crystalized souls; however, most people on the Western Frontier aren't willing to trade goods for a vial of pain-soaked blood."

Even so, there's a world of difference between the Jorasco Healing House you'll find in Wroat and the Patchery, the tiny clinic run by Daff d'Jorasco in the town of Quickstone. This can have a variety of effects. For one, the selection of goods is always more limited. In Quickstone, the blacksmith, Bel, can make you a Trident if you give her a day or two, but she doesn't have one just sitting on the rack ready for sale. And if you're not dealing with businesses licensed by dragonmarked houses, prices will often vary based on the perceived need and means of the customer. The upside to this is that you can occasionally find goods that aren't available in the standardized shops of the east. At the Patchery, Daff may only have a small supply of Potions of Healing available. But he could have a special potion he's mixed up using a byeshk infusion and a bit of what he's fairly certain was troll blood. He can't be sure what it will do until you drink it, but he thinks it's a potion of Heal. Do you want to buy it and find out? This idea goes even further in the markets of Droaam. Without the standards imposed by the Dragonmarked Houses, there's a lot of potential snake oil on the market. Some things might not work at all (\"It's not my fault! It's your thin human blood!\"); others might have remarkable effects that are more powerful than an adventurer could normally get at the price. Will they take a chance?",

There's no dodging in a duel; you need to look your rival in the eye as you strike them down. Because of this, an arcane duel only involves a single attack from each combatant\u2014and that single blast can be deadly, regardless of how many Hit Points you possess.",
												"The arcane duel is an old tradition with deep roots, especially in Aundair. Lethal duels are outlawed in the Five Nations, but few people care about that on the frontier. Dueling is about the perception of justice and of reputation. A would-be duelist calls out their opponent in front of as many people as possible, laying out their grievances. To refuse a duel is an admission of guilt and cowardice. In most communities, if someone refuses a duel, it's probably time for them to leave town\u2014or they might find themselves run out of town with a conductor stone hanging from their neck.",

										"Dragonmarked houses and others are heading to the Western Frontier. House Orien is extending the lightning rail toward Graywall. But this is no story of Brelish colonialism. Breland isn't expanding across this frontier\u2014it's being driven away from it. Throughout the history of Galifar, the people of the Barrens were divided. The medusas of Cazhaak Draal, the changelings of Lost, and the tieflings of the Venomous Demesne were isolated city-states, which avoided contact both with Breland and with one another. These cultures were all but unknown in the east, so the dominant impression of the region was of the chaotic chib culture. The Daughters of Sora Kell brought these diverse factions together. Force was a factor in the creation of Droaam, and fear of Maenya's Fist still plays an important role in keeping the old chibs in line. But the common depiction of Droaamites as squalid villages of goblins dominated by slow-witted ogres is driven by ignorance and Brelish propaganda. Under the Daughters of Sora Kell, each of the cultures of the region is a thread of a growing tapestry. New villages and towns are rising up from the Barrens, their construction driven by ogre strength, goblin enthusiasm, and the brilliant architects and masons of Cazhaak Draal. Magewrights from the Venomous Demesne are implementing an arcane infrastructure that could in time outshine the everyday amenities of the Five Nations. Droaam is a very young nation, still finding its footing and establishing traditions. But it is growing stronger every day, and it's only a matter of time until its great cities\u2014like Graywall and the Great Crag\u2014rival Wroat and Fairhaven. And it is this that is drawing the influx of travel and trade from the east; the glimpse of opportunities as Droaam grows and prospers.",
										"With that said, it is largely in the great cities\u2014such as Graywall, Vralkek, Cazhaak Draal\u2014that this renaissance is occurring. The Droaamites who dwell on the Western Frontier are remnants of the old system of chib rule, where a family of ogres or minotaurs would dominate a community of goblins and kobolds. Under the leadership of the Daughters, Droaamite workers are assured food, shelter, and security. Today, the chibs are expected to protect their people, not to oppress them; a modern chib serves as both mayor and sheriff. The Daughters are likewise encouraging the spread of Droaamite species into all communities. Though goblins may make up the majority of a village's population, there could be a harpy songbird in the inn, a tiefling magewright teaching a class of kobold sorcerers, and the old ogre chib may have been replaced by a wise medusa. So, at first glance, a Droaamite village in the Barrens might seem primitive... but look closer, and you'll see a well-fed population, working together to improve the conditions of the community. But again, this system is new and the idea of Droaam is still finding its footing along the border. The old chib system still lingers, especially in the villages around Turakbar's Fist; Rhesh Turakbar and his reavers still enforce order with force and fear.",
										"When dealing with a Droaamite community\u2014or envisioning the background of an adventurer from Droaam\u2014keep these things in mind. Droaam has only existed in its current form for a decade, and any villages along the Border Road will be younger than that. Because of this, a village will have been built for a reason\u2014taking advantage of water, a manifest zone, mineral deposits identified by House Tharashk, or something else that makes the spot worth building on. And more so than in the typical Brelish village, Droaamties often have a sense of hope; they are working together, and their nation is on the rise. The exception to this is in the vicinity of Turakbar's Fist. Here the villages are older, as Turakbar's Fist has dominated the region since before the rise of Galifar. And many of those villages are ruled by tyrannical chibs and weighed down by despair.",
										"Droaam has a few institutions that play a vital role in the nation, and whose agents can be encountered on the frontier.",
										"{@b {@i Katra's Voice}} is the diplomatic arm of Droaam, and Voices are envoys, entertainers, diplomats, and mediators. Their task is to maintain morale and lines of communication, and to help resolve disputes before they get out of hand. Agents of Katra's Voice are usually changelings, medusas, tieflings, or harpies. Many highlight their role as entertainers, sharing stories with the common folk and painting tales of the bright future that lies ahead. Others focus more on mediation, especially if there is unrest between the local chib and the inhabitants of the community. Katra's Voice also includes wandering magistrates, who typically travel with two soldiers of Maenya's Fist. The current fashion is for medusas to serve as magistrates; if they consider a plaintiff's complaint to be frivolous, they petrify them. However, there are a few changeling magistrates with exceptional telepathic abilities who excel at unraveling difficult situations.",
										"{@b {@i Maenya's Fist}} is the personal army of Sora Maenya, which acts to defend the nation and to enforce the rule of the Daughters when Katra's Voice fails to resolve an issue. The foundation of the Fist is a corps of armored war trolls and skullcrusher ogres that are fanatically devoted to Sora Maenya; a single war troll can scatter a band of insubordinate ogres. However, over the last decade, the Fist has expanded to include a broader range of forces, including centaur cavalry, air support from gargoyles and harpies, rangers and scouts drawn from the Dark Pack, and more. As a general rule, warlords are expected to use their own forces to maintain order in their domains; near Turakbar's Fist adventurers are more likely to encounter a band of minotaurs than a squad of Maenya's Fist. Fists are either dispatched directly by Sora Maenya to deal with known threats, or found in the company of a Voice or an Eye whose mission they are supporting. Consider them Droaam's answer to the Westwind Riders\u2014or in the case of a large company of Maenya's Fist, the equivalent of Breland bringing Argonth into play.",
										"{@b {@i Teraza's Eye}} gathers information for the Daughters, and its members serve as sages, inquisitives, and chroniclers. Droaam is a new nation, and the Daughters need to know if their experiment is working. Often, Eyes simply travel and observe, gathering information without interfering; if they uncover dangerous situations, they will call on the Voice or the Fist. However, they can be tasked to investigate intriguing mysteries\u2014typically supernatural threats, as diplomatic or judicial matters will be handled by Katra's Eyes.",
										"{@b {@i The Znir Pact}} is another force adventurers on the Western Frontier will come to know. These gnolls are mercenary soldiers. Half of the Pact has been hired by the Daughters to serve as general peacekeepers, supplementing the forces of the local warlord and dealing with troubles that don't require the full power of Maenya's Fist. Znir gnolls can also be found serving a local warlord. So Znir patrols can be found on the Border Road or on the old roads, but they will generally ignore adventurers unless there is a threat that needs to be dealt with.",
										"So, new villages are springing up along the Border Road. Graywall is expanding. The lightning rail is heading west. And a squad of Maenya's war trolls showing up should be legitimately frightening. {@i Droaam is on the rise.}",

												"One of the most distinctive elements of an adventure on the Western Frontier is the presence of Droaamite species traditionally thought of as monsters, whether as adventurers or as NPCs. Due to the efforts of House Tharashk, Droaamites are starting to appear in cities across the Five Nations. But on the Western Frontier, they are a part of everyday life. Travel on the Border Road, and you'll run into Znir patrols and wandering worgs. Stop in a village west of the road, and you'll find a harpy singing in the tavern, delighting a crowd of goblins and kobolds. Communities east of the road usually have a Brelish majority, but you may still find an ogre unloading crates from the Thunder Coach, a gargoyle watching from a roof, or a family of goblins starting a new life. This section provides a closer look at the species that are presented as character options in chapter 4, along with an overview of many other denizens of Droaam.

The wind carried her whispers through the stone, and the gargoyles perched on the walls and crouching in the corridors of the keep turned on the templars.",

And a few follow their own paths, driven by curiosity or by the bonds they've formed with places or people. Some are tireless workers, while others spend days at a time resting on a wall or in a square.

																"Evidence suggests that Dhakaani stoneworkers in the region became obsessed with these \"guardian statues\" in the decades leading up to the first open conflict with daelkyr forces... and it was during that battle that the daelkyr Orlassk breathed life into the countless guardians. Orlassk never controlled the gargoyles directly, but they came into existence with an instinctive revulsion for organic life, a reaction much like most humans have when encountering mold or viruses. Creatures of flesh are fundamentally repulsive, rotting monstrosities filled with disgusting fluids and leaking foul excrement. The first gargoyles lashed out against the dar surrounding them, and claimed the fortresses they had once guarded as their own. But they soon realized that they were vastly outnumbered by the creatures of flesh. Beyond this, they didn't need anything from the world beyond their walls. They didn't need food or other supplies. So they remained at their posts, and eventually fell into a deep torpor. In this state, their spark of life was so weak that they couldn't even be sensed by {@spell Detect Good and Evil|XPHB}, which is how the templars of Brightstone Keep failed to recognize them for what they were. But they were still aware of their surroundings on a deep level. When Katra spoke to the gargoyles of Brightstone, each heard something different, the perfect story to pull them from their slumber. Some heard tales of the wonders waiting to be seen out in the world. For others, she painted pictures of the excitement to be found in battle, or the satisfaction to be found in protecting someone one cares about. Her magic roused them, but not all the stone host joined the hag. A small force of gargoyles had heard the songs and teachings of the Silver Flame even while they slept, and found the vision of the Flame to be compelling. These gargoyles helped a group of friars escape and return to Flamekeep, where they have embraced the Silver Flame and fight alongside the templars to this day; these gargoyles are now known as the {@i wingwyrds}.",
																"Brightstone Keep wasn't the only place where Sora Katra woke slumbering gargoyles. There were a handful of other shunned keeps along the edge of the Byeshk Mountains, and Katra roused the gargoyles in each. And there was one place where some gargoyles were already awake: Cazhaak Draal, the city at the heart of the Stonelands. When the medusas laid claim to the city, their queen spoke to the slumbering gargoyles. Some chose to remain in their torpor, but a handful awoke and were eventually convinced to work with the medusas. It was through this alliance that the gargoyles learned how to reproduce, as described later in this article. Medusa and gargoyle alike chose to remain isolated from the warlike denizens of the Barrens, and the gargoyles of Cazhaak Draal rarely left the fortress city. But the Cazhaak gargoyles have been awake for over a century; they are more used to the world and to working side by side with organic creatures, and some have adopted the Cazhaak faith. When the Daughters of Sora Kell established a new province centered on the newly-christened Grimstone Keep and appointed Cairngorm to serve as warlord and guardian of the province, many of the gargoyles of Cazhaak Draal flocked to their new prince.",
																"In creating a gargoyle, consider which of these categories you fall into. Did you slumber in the ruins for thousands of years? Did you live alongside the medusas of Cazhaak Draal? Are you a newborn, hewn in the gravel pits of Cazhaak Draal and still crafting your final form? Or are you a gargoyle with no connections to Droaam whatsoever... a statue infused with life elsewhere in the world?"

																"Gargoyles are elemental creatures, and their physiology defies all natural laws. When a gargoyle stands still, it is indistinguishable from a stone statue. They are made of light, inanimate stone... And yet, when they choose to move, they can. This same illogic applies to their wings. Gargoyle wings can take many forms, but the vast majority couldn't possibly keep a gargoyle aloft, and yet somehow they fly. Some scholars believe the gargoyles fly through an instinctive manipulation of elemental air, but nothing has been proven. With that said, the fact that gargoyles have the elemental type doesn't mean that they have any planar connection or any bond to other elemental creatures. They are elementals because they are creatures of animate stone.",
																"The majority of gargoyles follow the model of the Dhakaani guardian statue\u2014the classic horned, bat-winged humanoid. However, this is only due to the fact that these statues were produced in mass quantities. Firstly, the Dhakaani gargoyles weren't stamped out of a mold. The horned, winged design is common, but some gargoyles have ram's horns, tribex horns, or no horns at all. Likewise, gargoyle wings can be long or ridiculously small, stone carved in the likeness of leather or feathers. Someone exceptionally versed in the history of Dhakaan could potentially identify the ruin a sleeper gargoyle comes from based on its artistic design. And yet, when Orlassk animated the statues of the Barrens, it affected more than just the guardians. There are wingless gargoyles carved in the shape of ancient Dhakaani heroes. The Dhakaani were especially infuriated by this mockery of their champions and made an extra effort to destroy these creatures, but there are still a few scattered among the host of Grimstone. In creating a gargoyle character, consider how your appearance reflects your choice of class. Unlike warforged, gargoyles weren't built for a specific purpose; the Dhakaani artisans had no idea their creations would come to life. But the material used or design of a gargoyle could influence its capability. A gargoyle Druid could be carved from densewood instead of stone, while a gargoyle Sorcerer could have dragonshards or slivers of demonglass incorporated into its stone body.",
																"This highlights the fact that not all gargoyles have wings. The classic Dhakaani guardian\u2014represented by the gargoyle stat block in the Monster Manual\u2014has wings and claws, and is formed from dense stone. But a gargoyle with the shape of a bugbear hero or a Cazhaak newborn may be made from softer stone and lack both claws and wings. These traits are reflected by the feats Wings of Stone and Hewn for Battle (see chapter 4). If your gargoyle character begins at a high level, you may start with these traits. If you're playing a 1st level gargoyle character, you have yet to assume your final form, or perhaps you've simply chosen not to add wings to your design.",
																"This choice is reflected in the way gargoyles reproduce and grow. Gargoyles have no functional reproductive organs. To reproduce, two or more gargoyles work together to carve an egg. During this ritual, they infuse the egg with a fraction of their own lifeforce. The egg is buried in a pit of gravel or stone shards. Over time, it absorbs the surrounding chunks of rock, instinctively assimilating these and reshaping them to build its own body. The appearance of a newborn gargoyle usually reflects a blending of its parents, but this is a foundation. Gargoyles don't need to eat, but a growing gargoyle will consume chunks of stone that will be added to its mass. As it continues to grow, its appearance will shift to match its own evolving self-image."

Likewise, among themselves, gargoyles use names that can only be formed by the subtle grinding of stone teeth. Any other name is chosen for the purpose of interacting with other creatures. Some gargoyles choose descriptive terms, often related to the form of stone their body is formed from. Others use nicknames given to them by their organic associates.

Seekers often work with House Tharashk, as they are interested in travel and exploring distant lands.",

Guardians are typically stationary; these are the traditional gargoyles found on fortress walls, remaining perfectly still until something threatens their charge. However, a guardian could form an attachment to another character or even to an idea, like the wingwyrds of the Silver Flame. When playing a guardian gargoyle, consider: what drove your choice of ward? Could anything break this devotion?",

This could be religion, philosophy, arcane science, or any other topic. As a gargoyle thinker, you are likely adventuring to gain access to new sources of information related to the topic that interests you. But whenever there is no need to move, you may fall into a still reverie; during downtime, you could spend days without moving, as you consider the information you've gained."

Rather than gold, gargoyles often want to be paid in stories, songs, or jokes; they then use these as social currency in dealings with other gargoyles. Most gargoyles are tone-deaf and struggle to master musical pursuits, but the rare gargoyle bards and entertainers are held in high regard."

														"The first gnolls were born in the Age of Demons, a product of the endless war between Rak Tulkhesh and the Wild Heart. Even after the overlords were bound, their fiendish influence drove gnolls to engage in vicious acts of brutality. For countless generations, gnolls fought trolls, ogres, other gnolls, and any other creatures they could find, seeking blood for their hungry idols. But in time, leaders arose who urged their clans to resist the call of endless war. They dragged their idols to the place now known as Znir (\"Stone\") and shattered them. Though they might be many clans, from this day forward, they would be one pack. They would allow no one\u2014not chib, god, or demon\u2014to hold dominion over them. This was easier said than done. Fighting the fiendish influence within was challenging enough, but the Barrens were a chaotic tapestry of battling forces. The leaders of the newly forged Znir Pact had no desire to rule over other creatures, but even holding territory could invite attack. And so they developed the path that has carried them forward to this day: the road of the mercenary. The gnolls would claim no territory beyond the lands around Znir. They would fight for any who would pay a fair price. But if anyone sought to enslave a gnoll, or to strike against Znir itself, they would face the wrath of all the united clans. This was a lesson that had to be taught many times, but after a century or so, the point was made. To those who paid them, the gnolls were as reliable as stone. Those who betrayed them or who picked a fight would fall before the might of the full Pact. They have followed this path ever since. One could look at the Pact and say that they serve many masters. But the Znir gnoll would respond that they serve only themselves: that they choose who they fight for, they set the terms of their service.",

																"The Znir gnolls include a dozen different clans, each of which holds distinct traditions. Once, the clans were devoted to different faces of the overlords, but when they shattered their statues, each clan chose one of the moons. All gnolls skillfully hunt and fight, but the Barrakas are known to be the finest trackers of the Pact; the Aryth, the deadliest archers; the Olarune, the strongest warriors and most forceful in the vanguard. Typically, mercenary units are composed of gnolls of a single clan, assigned based on the nature of the task that lies ahead, and contracts are usually negotiated for a period based on the cycles of the clan's moon. The clans maintain distinct territories within the Znir region, but all gnolls are welcome around the hearth of any clan; the Znir take pains to crush any tension that arises between the clans. Shamans and leaders from each clan maintain a council at the Znir, around the broken idols. Here they mediate disputes, assign contracts to clans, and allocate funds and equipment. The Eyre clan has honed their skills as smiths and tanners, and they craft much of the equipment used by the Znir gnolls\u2014though there is still a strong tradition of scavenging among the Znir, and warriors often claim trophies from fallen foes.",
																"The Znir defied the overlords when they shattered their statues, but there's still a spark of a fiend in the blood of each gnoll. Young gnolls learn how to resist this influence\u2014to channel the strength of the fiend without giving it power over them. For most gnolls, this is a matter of discipline; Znir gnolls are known for remaining calm in the face of provocation, and having learned to fight their own demons, they aren't easily manipulated by mortals. However, some gnolls learn to draw on their unnatural heritage and to channel this power in useful ways. Znir gnolls have their own equivalents of rangers and barbarians; the ranger's primal magic draws on the Wild Heart, while the barbarian channels the fury of the Rage of War. Znir shamans are similar to warlocks, typically following the path of the Fiend. However, in all of these examples, the Znir don't serve the dark power. Rather, they can be seen as stealing their strength from it; learning to draw on it without giving anything in return. In their determination not to let fiendish forces hold dominion over their people, the Znir gnolls have also developed their own techniques for fighting supernatural threats. Champions trained to face fiends and undead are known as hwyri\u2014Gnoll for \"warden\"\u2014and wield powers similar to those of paladins in other lands. However, hwyri don't worship any divine power. Their abilities come from training and understanding of the demon within; they aren't crusaders, they're mercenary demon hunters. Most hwyri come from the Vult clan, and in a land that shuns the Silver Flame, these gnolls can be the best hope for people facing fiendish threats."

These troops are present to protect the region from brigands or invaders, and to help maintain order. But they serve the Daughters, not the local chib; it's understood that if the chib or their warlord turns against the Daughters, the local Znir will act against them.

Within Droaam, Znir customs are known and respected, and the Znir can unite against anyone who defies them. The Znir recognize that they don't hold such power over the rulers of the Five Nations, and are concerned about serving so far from their stones. In addition to those who serve through House Tharashk or Daask, a number of Znir have been sent east to study the Five Nations, gathering knowledge of its people and customs so the Znir council can determine how to engage with the wider world. This scouting role is a reasonable path for a gnoll player character; it's their job to travel the world beyond and learn its ways, and to make friends and allies."

Functionally, a myrnaxe is a Battleaxe, but it can be used to inflict either Slashing damage (with the axeblade) or Piercing damage (with the spearhead). It's common for each head to be made of a different metal, so the spearhead might be silver while the axeblade is made of byeshk\u2014thus maximizing its versatility against multiple foes. The Znir consider the myrnaxe a signature weapon of their pact and don't sell them to outsiders. The only way to acquire a myrnaxe is to be given one or to take it from a fallen foe."

Its sweet song has lured countless adventurers to their deaths, drawing them in close for the harpy to kill and then consume.\"} They were said to be children of the Fury and the Shadow set on Eberron to torment innocents and drive people to madness; the name harpy was a pejorative term. Scholars can point to historical examples of explorers drawn into chasms and other hazards. However, in many of these cases, the luring harpy wasn't even aware of the adventurers doomed by her voice. She sought only to sing, to express her joy or her sorrow\u2014and those who heard her wanted nothing more than to hear her better, ignoring all dangers as they pursued the haunting song. Most harpies take no glee in suffering or death, but they cannot help the impact their voices have on the people around them.

They carve roosts into cliff faces with the power of their songs, and have felt no need to build cities or raise monuments; in their isolation, they don't need walls to defend themselves from enemies. Culturally, the Byeshk harpies are split into flights, and within flights they are further split into communities known as choirs. Flights are defined by traditions and by their songs; much like the Phiarlan elves, certain songs are treasures of a flight, heirlooms passed down to a single chosen singer.",
																"A decade ago, Sora Katra came to the high peaks and spoke to the elder voices of each flight. She painted a picture of a nation united, of the scattered creatures of the Barrens singing one song, and she asked the elders to descend and make this vision real. Harpies are passionate, and the leaders of the flights were passionate in their views. Four flights\u2014the Carrion Callers, the Last Dirge, the Rotwings, and the Stormsingers\u2014embraced Katra's vision, choosing to leave their mountain homes behind and lead their entire flights behind. Others refused. Some had no desire to leave their high mountains. Others doubted Katra's ability to achieve her dreams or questioned her motives. Callain of the Bloody Word said that the people of the world weren't meant to sing with one voice. The harpies of the Haunting Song took this further, swearing to use their voices to break Katra's vision. This led to the Carrion Callers and Stormsingers joining their voices together to break the Haunting Song. Katra chose to leave the other six dissenting flights in peace. They do not harm Droaam in their high peaks, but they take little part in it. While down below, the harpies of the four flights that are bound to the Daughters have spread across the realm. Harpy song is the mortar that binds the nation together. Songbirds rouse people's spirits at the start of a work day, and soothe them when work is done. Harpies inspire and delight; they can give hope to those who doubt, and end conflicts with a peaceful word. And when it comes to war, they can use their voices as weapons. Most harpies take no glee in suffering and death\u2014but in the first attack on Orcbone, harpy songs had defenders flinging themselves off the walls of the fortress to reach the source of the song.

The Stormsingers say that the Fury and the Devourer are one and the same, that the Song shapes the storm even as she drives the currents of the heart. The Last Dirge believes that the Song began at the first moment of creation, and that when it reaches its end the world will fade away. Regardless of belief, harpies feel the power of the Song flowing through them when they sing. However, it is power that must be mastered. The legendary lure isn't something all harpies can do; it is an art, and among the harpies those who can perform this are called sirens. But all harpies have power. The most basic gift that all harpies possess is the power to cast {@spell Friends}\u2014shifting emotions with a word. All harpies have access to a particular set of effects\u2014{@spell Charm Person|XPHB|Charm}, {@spell Suggestion|XPHB}. But beyond the abilities granted by the Harpy species, many class abilities can be linked to voice. It's easy to see how a harpy Bard can tie her magic to her song, but a harpy Cleric will sing her prayers; a harpy Druid channels the power of nature with his voice; and a harpy Warlock could depict her {@spell Eldritch Blast|XPHB} as sharp words that strike with physical force.

Today, the medusas of Cazhaak Draal are a vital part of Droaam, serving as priests, architects, magistrates, and more. Throughout Droaam, they are valued for their intelligence and discipline as well as their deadly gaze. But there are also medusas who follow their own paths\u2014mystics guided by the whispers of the Shadow, artists in search of inspiration, adventurers seeking to learn more about the world beyond their walls. A handful of medusas served with House Tharashk during the final years of the Last War, and as long as they follow local ordinances, medusas won't be met by mobs or hunted by templars in the cities of the Five Nations. But they will draw attention and will often be met with suspicion or fear when dealing with those who have little experience with Droaamites.",

																"Medusas are Monstrosities; whether they were shaped by the daelkyr or the Shadow, they're supernatural creatures with inhuman features. From a distance, they can be mistaken for humans. Up close, the differences become clear. Medusas blend aspects of mammal and reptile; some medusa bloodlines have scaled skin, while others appear to be carved from stone. Culturally, Cazhaak medusas tend to present themselves as calm and confident, cool as stone. This reflects both the weight of their power and the confidence it gives them; to a medusa, all other creatures are fragile, and a medusa must take care not to break them. Beyond this, the Cazhaak faith is strong among the medusas and there is a serenity that comes from being one of the Shadow's chosen people. Many Cazhaak medusas are asexual; they value companionship and love, but aren't strongly influenced by sexual desire. However, not all medusas share these characteristics! There are medusas who embrace the passions of the Fury, and those who feel no devotion to the Cazhaak Six and follow different paths. Cazhaak medusas can live up to 250 years; they rarely show the effects of aging until the very end, and even then it's common for respected elders to be petrified and preserved in Cazhaak Draal. Most Cazhaak medusas are female, but roughly one in five are male; there's no mechanical difference between the medusa genders."

																"The Cazhaak priests state that the first medusas were held in bondage in a realm of stone, where they were forced to carve strange monuments and mazes, to labor endlessly in mines, to build towers only to raze them and start again. The Shadow recognized their potential and ambition and gave them the power to break their chains; after an exodus that led them through many strange demiplanes, they finally reached the shelter of Cazhaak Draal. While the medusas thank the Shadow for their gifts, other scholars feel that this story shows that the medusas were created by the daelkyr Orlassk, and rebelled against their creator. Whether their gifts flow from the Shadow or from the daelkyr, medusas have an affinity for stone and for other creatures that possess the power of petrification. This isn't a primal bond like that of a druid or a Lorghalan gnome; it's in many ways a deeply unnatural connection, a reflection of the fact that, for a medusa, the line between flesh and stone is flexible. Most medusas say that they can hear stone whispering in its sleep; others say that it sings to them. Medusas who have an especially strong affinity for the stone can master a number of supernatural powers, from being able to mold and shape stone to locating veins of minerals and ore by listening to the songs.",
																"As a medusa, consider your relationship to the stone. If you're playing a character with spells related to stone, you could tie these to this gift; a Ranger with a spell like {@spell Entangle} could cause tendrils of stone to rise up from the earth rather than plants.

Any creature can learn Serpentine as a rare language or understand it through the use of magic, but only a creature with a functioning serpent mane can speak Serpentine.",

As such, it's easy for an observer to tell when a medusa is using this ability and where the serpents are looking. The most important aspect of this is that it allows a medusa to operate without penalty while their primary eyes are closed or covered. It's more natural for a medusa to view the world through their primary eyes, and most prefer it, but they can act normally even while wearing a blindfold or while their eyes are closed.",

Their gaze is painful but not instantly lethal, and they must focus their energy to generate a more dramatic effect. Over time, they can build up to Stone Eyes\u2014or they can simply maintain Gray Gaze. Medusas generally don't discuss these differences with outsiders; it's generally to their benefit for outsiders to assume that every medusa has the Shadowswift gaze.",
														"The gaze of a medusa is dangerous even to friends, and as a result, Cazhaak medusas are quite skilled at avoiding eye contact. In conversation, where a medusa directs their eyes reflects their esteem for the person they're speaking with. A Cazhaak medusa will drop their eyes toward the ground to show respect, or look up and over the person if they wish to indicate disdain; when speaking to an equal, they glance to the left or right. If a medusa wishes to show trust, they direct their gaze at the person, but close their eyes.",
														"While the medusa's gaze is a constant effect, it is a supernatural gift as opposed to being biological. Over time, a medusa can learn to enhance this power\u2014using their gaze as a focus for the spells presented in the Shadow's Magic trait, whether to increase the power of {@spell Gray Gaze|FoEQuickstone} or to restrain multiple creatures at once. While this may consume a spell slot, the power is channeled through the medusa's gaze; this is a potent emotional experience for the medusa.",

The fact that it requires a Bonus Action to use Gray Gaze reflects the challenge of actively meeting someone's gaze, especially when people know the consequences. So, while mechanically the gaze is presented as a cantrip the medusa casts, that is just the cleanest way to mechanically represent the concept within the system; the IDEA is still that anyone who meets the medusa's gaze would suffer the effects of the Gray Gaze."

Throughout much of Khorvaire, tieflings are seen as ill omens and heralds of misfortune, even more so than those who carry aberrant dragonmarks. Such planar tieflings don't pass their traits to their children, and their rarity is part of what fuels fears. But there is a place where entire families of tieflings rule over a city of wonders. These tieflings are descended from the lords of the fallen nation of Ohr Kaluun. During the Sundering of Sarlona, these lords fled to Khorvaire and established a refuge, shielded from mundane and mystical sight. The tiefling lords and their human subjects remained in this shielded sanctuary for over a thousand years, building a city-state of arcane wonders. But the shields that protected the Venom Lords prevented them from leaving the demesne, and they had to take extreme measures to control their numbers and to power their many wonders. Ohr Kaluun was a harsh land, and the power of the tiefling lords came from old pacts with malefic forces; they were more than willing to walk the road of painful sacrifice to achieve their goals.",

Human magewrights are helping to develop the arcane infrastructure of the new nation, while the noble tieflings bring greater powers to bear. Some tieflings see the world beyond the wards as a miserable backwater, hopelessly primitive.

It is located within a manifest zone tied to Daanvi, and Daanvian fiends are some of the strongest patrons of the Demesne. While petitioners learn to bind and banish fey, pacts with fey are discouraged; an adventurer with ties to an archfey may have defied their family's traditions.",

Teleportation and extradimensional spaces are incorporated into transit and housing. Casual illusions are used for entertainment and practical purposes. While the Maze of Mysteries is familiar with necromancy, the use of undead is quite rare in the Demesne... not because of any squeamishness, but simply because the traditions of the Demesne have other uses for the resources involved. Because all magic comes with a price. In the wider world, Eberron dragonshards are used to fuel arcane industry. But the Venomous Demesne was cut off from the outside world for over a thousand years; they had to find other sources of energy. The lords of Ohr Kaluun had long dealt with malefic powers and beyond that, the Demesne needed to limit its population. This led to the development of techniques that draw on the living for power. Two common currencies of the Demesne are {@b pain} and {@b time}\u2014each of which is transmitted through the medium of blood, drawn out in drops or carried in vials. Pain involves the immediate experience of pain, and is measured in loss of Hit Points. Time draws on the life force of the subject, providing a far greater yield than temporary pain, but resulting in a permanent reduction of an individual's maximum Hit Points. There are many other forms of currency, depending on the needs of the project and what the subject has to offer. Heartfelt tears have power. True and dangerous secrets can be useful. But the greatest power is the soul itself. There is a vast engine beneath the Maze of Promises that catches the souls of all who die within the wards of the Demesne. Souls with value may be set aside and given to the Maze of Faith for the possibility of resurrection. The rest are drawn into the great engine and distilled into crystal shards, which are capable of fueling magic just like an Eberron dragonshard.",

There is no cost to casting a cantrip, unless the adventurer wants to say that they jab their palm with a needle to trigger a jolt of pain. The soul- shards of the Demesne function just like Eberron dragonshards; they can be used in place of other costly components. So a Demesne eremite can use a soul- shard to cast Divination instead of burning incense... but a Demesne Wizard doesn't need to burn a fragment of a soul to cast {@spell Magic Missile|XPHB}. Like dragonshards in the wider world, it is the fuel of industry more than it is used by the typical adventurer. However, this is a key element in the fact that, as powerful and wondrous as the Demesne is, it lacks House Cannith's capabilities for mass production. The Maze of Making can produce Legendary magic items\u2014but it can't produce them quickly or in vast quantities."

												"What is a worg? The people of the Five Nations generally think of them as talking wolves. In his Codex Carnivorous, Dorius Alyre ir'Korran concluded that worgs were wolves that had been altered by Dhakaani magebreeders. He further stated that \"... the worg is an evil predator that delights in hunting and devouring creatures weaker than itself.\"",
												"Everything about this is wrong. The word \"worg\" is a flawed form of what these creatures call themselves\u2014wuura'gaa, the children of the wood. They are a unique canid species, distinct from wolves and dogs. The Dhakaani worked closely with worgs, and because of this, small populations of worgs can be found across Khorvaire in places where the Dhakaani had strongholds. But the goblins didn't create the worgs... and worgs are no more inherently evil than goblins, gnomes, or humans.",

It is a hypernatural environment, like some Lamannian manifest zones; it is impossible to tame the Wood or to establish outposts within it; any structures will be overcome by accelerated growth and decay. This is the birthplace of the worgs. Despite its traits, it is not tied to Lamannia. It doesn't look outwards; the Wood watches what lies within. There is a vast pit in the center of the Watching Wood, surrounded by rotting vegetation and sludgy soil. The Worgs call this Nuushka, the Wound. They say it is a wound inflicted on the First Mother at the dawn of creation\u2014an injury inflicted on Eberron by Khyber's claws. The hypernatural traits of the Watching Wood are a response to the Wound. The fiends and foul things that emerge from the Wound are torn apart by the denizens of the Wood, never reaching the world beyond. Because of this, the Watching Wood is home to a vast array of monstrosities and beasts, both dire and horrid. It's worth noting that these monstrosities may seem monstrous to humans\u2014but they are children of Eberron, distinct from aberrations. And it is the hypernatural power of Eberron that resisted both the corruption of Avassh and the force that shaped the Barrens.",
														"There are thousands of worgs in the Watching Wood. Their packs are united by common traditions and an instinctive bond to contain the threat of the Wound, but there are a number of unique subcultures\u2014not unlike the Lhazaar Principalities. The Stone Fangs are the fiercest warriors of the inner woods. The worgs of The Menagerie have developed a shapeshifting tradition that mirrors the druidic Circle of the Moon. The Marrowbound turn the power of the Wound against its spawn, pursuing a warlock path. But these packs dwell in the deep woods, and most have never seen or been seen by humanoids. It is the worgs of the outermost woods that interact with outsiders. In the past, they have been known as the Calador, loosely translated as the Uncaged or the Restless. It is the Calador who left the wood to work with the Dhakaani. But a century ago, the elf werewolf Zaeurl came to the Watching Wood, leading an exodus of lycanthropes from Aundair and the Eldeen Reaches. Zaeurl forged an alliance between her refugees, the Calador worgs, and other sentient predators of the outer woods. Together they became the Ghaal'kechan\u2014the Great Pack. Where the Calador had previously kept to the woods and kept others out of it, under Zaeurl's leadership they began to interact with the humanoids on the edge of their domain, forming ties with the gnolls of the Znir Pact and the changelings of Lost. As Droaam rose from the Barrens, Zaeurl accepted the title of warlord\u2014and many among the Ghaal'kechan chose to leave the Watching Wood and become a part of this greater pack.",

You never know what you'll encounter on the road\u2014just gotta hope you'll live to see the morning."

This chapter deals with the people and places you might encounter during your travels in this region. Perhaps you'll visit the quickstone quarries of the aptly named town of Quickstone, plumb the depths of Silver Lake, or try to impede the malevolent powers stirring beneath Turakbar's Fist.

								"The heart of the Western Frontier is the vast stretch of plains that lies between the Korlaac Rift to the west and the Whitehorn Woods in the east. In the south, the Graywall Mountains serve as a simple dividing line between Droaam and Breland, but there's no clear natural boundary in the central plains. As a result, people have turned to an unnatural feature; the Orien trade road that runs between Ardev and Sylbaran. For centuries, this road has been a crucial channel for trade and supplies. During the Last War, Breland maintained forces at the Eldeen Ford, but the agreements with the Dragonmarked Houses kept Aundair from targeting the road. In the wake of the war, it has continued to serve as a crucial path for commerce between Breland, Aundair, and the Eldeen Reaches. As they are working to forge alliances with the dragonmarked houses, the Daughters of Sora Kell are reluctant to disrupt the trade road\u2014and Breland is determined to hold it, recently assigning Argonth to patrol the edge of the road. While Breland has yet to acknowledge Droaam's sovereignty, the common people recognize the trade road as the line between the two nations\u2014and this idea was strengthened when House Sivis used the road to define the boundary between Droaam and Breland. While its official name is Orien Route 7, if you've spent any time on the Western Frontier, you know it as the Border Road.",
								"The Border Road isn't a hard line. There are kobolds camping in the more fertile lands east of the road and Brelish settlers seizing opportunities to the west. If a patrol of Westwind Riders is chasing brigands on the Brelish side, they won't stop the instant the bandits cross the Border Road into Droaamish lands. However, the Border Road is a definite line of truce between the two nations. The Westwind Riders won't cross the road unless they have reason to\u2014and the Znir gnolls serving the Daughters of Sora Kell keep their patrols to the west of the road. If they're on the western side of the Border Road, the minotaurs of Turakbar's Fist are soldiers of Droaam defending their nation; if they're encountered to the east of the road, they're raiders seeking glory. Such raids often go both ways; the Brelish draw attention to these minotaur attacks, but prefer not to address the fact that the Black Crown brigands are just as brutal when they attack Droaamite settlements on the west side of the road. If you're Brelish, you can consider yourself generally safer if you stay to the east, and Droaamites feel more secure west of the Border Road\u2014but there's no absolute security anywhere on the Western Frontier, unless you're inside Argonth.",
								"As an adventurer, your travels will likely lead you off the beaten trail, but the Border Road is at the center of the Western Frontier, and the focus of commerce and travel. The plains around the road are sparsely populated and filled with dangers: wandering monstrosities, brigands, sinkholes, and other unexpected hazards. You can easily blaze your own trail across the plains, but if you do, there's a chance you could go a day or more without even seeing another humanoid, let alone an inn\u2014and if you're set upon by bandits, there's little chance the Westwind Riders will show up to save you. The Border Road is paved and maintained. Brelish forces patrol the road. There are Gold Dragon Inns waiting for you at Sylbaran, Unicorn Point, Quickstone, and Ardev. There are a host of hamlets and farmsteads along the road; like a river, this channel of trade and travel provides a strong foundation for new communities to build on. These benefits come with a dark side though; because the Border Road is the safest, best maintained route for commerce, it's also the prime target for brigands and highwaymen. Think of it like pirates on the sea, but instead of galleons there are Orien Thunder Coaches laden with goods. While there are many forces that work to counter banditry\u2014the Westwind Riders, Argonth, the Blades of Orien\u2014the road is long, and successful bandits move quickly.",

										"Orien Route 7 is a major trade road, constructed by House Orien and designed to support trade caravans. It is thirty-five feet across, designed to allow a steady stream of traffic in two directions. The road is paved with a mixture of tar and gravel, similar to asphalt. This mixture is infused with a dash of finely ground Siberys dragonshards, which facilitates the magical effects employed by Orien heirs; this causes the road to glitter faintly in Bright Light, and harmless sparks sometimes rise under the hooves or wheels of Orien-enhanced vehicles and mounts. There are no guardrails or barriers along most of the length of the road, but in regions where the terrain is particularly hazardous to vehicles\u2014for example, a stretch in the north with swamplike terrain\u2014there are two-foot railings along the edge of the road.",
										"The even, well-maintained surface of the road helps travelers maintain a swift pace\u2014while traveling exclusively on Orien trade roads, travelers gain a 10% bonus to their travel pace. A vehicle or mount carrying a passenger with the Dragonmark of Passage can add an additional 10% to its pace; the passive enchantments worked into the road are triggered by the Mark of Passage, enhancing the momentum of the Orien heir and their mount.",
										"Breland maintains watchtowers that are spaced every 20 miles along the road. These are simple towers\u2014often just a platform atop a pillar\u2014where a handful of soldiers keep an eye out for trouble. The guards at these watchtowers aren't sufficient to battle bandits or raiders alone; but if they spot trouble, they can trigger an Alarm that alerts Orcbone, while sending up a flare to summon any nearby Brelish forces. Aside from this, there are villages, hamlets, and farmsteads all along the road. Most of these are small communities without dragonmarked services; they rely on the constant stream of traffic for news and services. However, villages usually have some form of pub or inn that travelers can take Advantage of, even if services are somewhat limited. The primary stopoff for travelers is Unicorn Point, an Orien outpost halfway between the Graywall Mountains and the Eldeen border."

Traffic is steady on the Border Road, but not overwhelming; it's possible to travel an hour without encountering traffic in the opposite direction. On the other hand, travelers can sometimes find themselves stuck traveling behind a long convoy of vehicles; even aside from planned caravans, merchants and teamsters leaving Unicorn Point often choose to travel together to deter brigands and raiders.",

										"For generations, the fortress Orcbone and its Westwind Riders have been the primary defense of the Western Frontier. That changed in 998 YK, when King Boranel assigned Argonth to the region. Once the most imposing weapon in Breland's arsenal, Argonth is a floating fortress quartering over a thousand soldiers and enough arcane artillery to level a village. Its presence in the region shows that Boranel recognizes the growing power of Droaam and the potential for renewed conflict. Argonth guards the southern stretch of the border; Orcbone is too far north to be able to quickly respond to an attack against Quickstone or the Westroad, the recently upgraded road to Graywall. While its mobility is useful, Argonth only has a sustainable cruising speed of 2 miles per hour and it can easily be avoided by mounted brigands or smugglers. But while it may not be able to intercept a small force of minotaur reavers, it can hold the Westroad against thousands if it comes to war.",

Breland stopped building the fortresses in 970 YK; military strategy has shifted, and Breland is currently following other paths (developing swift, mobile forces; improving artillery; developing air forces). On the Aundairian border, Argonth is something of a relic. But on the frontier, Argonth serves as a check on the Droaamite forces stationed at Graywall and as a symbol of Breland's determination to hold the region.",

The Force Staffs draw power from the elemental engine and don't require Breath of Siberys, but the others must be loaded normally. Argonth also has sixteen Long Rods, which can be removed and distributed to ground troops if necessary. This arcane artillery, and the Breath of Siberys that powers it, are described in Exploring Eberron.",

There are a few modest rooms at Bahiri's, and these are usually occupied by gnome or halfling travelers and expatriates. Some people believe that Bahiri's is a center for intrigue, that the Trust and the goblin spies known as the Silent Folk both run operations out of this inn; however, it's likely these rumors are largely exaggerated."

										"For hundreds of years, the fortress Orcbone has guarded western Breland from the monsters of the western barrens and the beasts of Whitehorn and the Towering Wood. While Galifar was intact, the primary mission of Orcbone was patrolling Orien Route 7, dealing with any bandits who threatened the Border Road. For much of the Last War, this region had little strategic value and Orcbone was underfunded and understaffed. This changed with the rise of Droaam. In 986 YK, Countess Thalia ir'Blis was killed by Droaamite forces and Orcbone itself suffered grave damage. King Boranel reinforced the fortress and appointed Commander Veirner ir'Tajar. Orcbone has held the line for the last decade, resisting a siege in 989 YK and serving as an important base of operations for lesser conflicts along the Western Frontier. However, with the rise of Graywall and Quickstone, most areas of strategic importance are in the southern region of the frontier, far from Orcbone. While the fortress continues to hold the line against Rhesh Turakbar and the forces of Turakbar's Fist, Boranel has deployed the floating fortress Argonth to secure the southern region and to serve as a symbol of Brelish might. Commander ir'Tajar sees this as a stinging rebuke of his command, and he may be right to think this; he's made questionable decisions over the last few years, and the deeds of Breggan Blackcrown\u2014both when she served under ir'Tajar's command and now as a brigand\u2014are a stain on his record. Many wonder when\u2014not if\u2014the king will replace ir'Tajar, and it's common knowledge that the commander would love a new outbreak of hostilities to prove his mettle.",
										"Orcbone takes its name from a series of conflicts that took place centuries ago, when the Gaa'aram orcs held what is now Turakbar's Fist. The Brelish fortress played a vital role in driving back these reavers. According to the tales, the bones of the fallen orcs were scattered across the plains as a warning, hence the name. Some believe you can still find shards of ancient bone around the fortress, while others claim that this was a foolish act that has left the region haunted by the restless spirits of fallen orcs.",
										"The Western Frontier is wide and open. Orcbone is built to withstand a siege, and the forces of the Barrens have attacked it a surprising number of times; the reavers see it as a way to test their mettle. However, given that attackers can easily just circle around the fortress, Orcbone's primary mission is to serve as a base of operations for the Westwind Riders, a cavalry force that patrols the Border Road and quickly responds to threats. There are watchtowers scattered around the region, approximately 20 miles apart. Each tower can signal Orcbone using a form of Alarm. This doesn't allow any sort of detailed message; if the alarm sounds, it's a call for the Westwind Riders to respond.",
										"Orcbone is an active military fortress. There are no services here for civilians, and you're unlikely to be admitted unless you possess the Soldier or Noble background. The fortress is made of stone, grim and functional in its design. It stands atop a slight hill that gives it a commanding view of the surrounding plains. Over the centuries, a series of wide ditches have been dug into the hill. To approach Orcbone, you must pass through these trenches while being fired upon by the archers in the keep; the classic Orcbone strategy is to have a force of Westwind Riders approach the attacking force from the rear, crushing them up against the walls of the keep. The keep itself shows its age; the walls are chipped and scorched. The Commander's requests for greater funds are generally met with the statement \"We sent you aid; we sent you Argonth.\"",

While Shavalant has a smaller population than Ardev or the great cities of the east, it is a wide town; ranchers 20 miles away from the town center still consider themselves to be part of Shavalant. The Farm is House Vadalis's largest enclave in Breland, and almost everyone in the town works for the house in some capacity.

According to the stories, Whitehorn is a massive horned bear\u2014\"larger than the largest dragon\"\u2014who dwells deep in the Whitehorn Woods. When settlers first came to the region, they cut back the woods and angered Whitehorn, who emerged and crushed their farmsteads. Eventually, Hala d'Vadalis\u2014who the locals generally call \"Hala Whitehorn''\u2014established a clear set of edicts about how to deal with the Whitehorn Woods, limiting harvesting and hunting.

										"While it's a charming story, this is Breland, not the Eldeen Reaches; Shavalant is an industrial town. There's a powerful Lamannian manifest zone in the Whitehorn Woods, and House Vadalis is harnessing the power of that zone to enhance the production of livestock. Beasts born in the ranches adjacent to the zone are especially strong and fertile. Attempts to cut back the woods or overharvesting of its resources trigger catastrophic effects\u2014including attacks by swarms of birds, dire beasts, and possibly, a megafauna bear. Beyond this, any structures built beyond the \"forest line\" rapidly rot or corrode. The people of Shavalant have learned exactly where the line is and they push right up to the edge. They do harvest lumber and hunt on the edge of the Whitehorn, taking Advantage of how quickly things regrow; it's simply that Hala's edicts set clear boundaries on just what can be harvested from the woods and when.

A similarly exotic ranch is the Bright Beak, which specializes in breeding hippogriffs.",

The Farm includes an administrative wing where Viceroy Kyara contemplates long-term strategies and evaluates reports from the many ranches Vadalis manages or licenses. Another wing is devoted to evaluating and working with new or exotic beasts and monstrosities; if Vadalis decides to try domesticating cockatrices, they'd start by bringing some to the Farm. The stables at the Farm are devoted to beasts that can't yet be handed off to a ranch. During the war, a few generations of dire bears were bred at the Farm before the work was transferred to the Royal Bear ranch. At the moment, they could be working on a better breed of tribex, a bloodhound with a sharper sense of smell, or songbirds that can mimic the voices of famous entertainers. The most secure branch of the Farm is the War Offices, where heirs work to evaluate and hone the martial abilities of their beasts. This includes developing more efficient means of training existing war beasts\u2014war tribex, war horses, war hounds\u2014as well as working to magebreed traits that could make such animals more effective on the battlefield. As suggested earlier, there are certainly rumors that the War Office has a division\u2014and perhaps, a secret subterranean facility\u2014devoted to beasts that can be used as tools of assassination.",

Orien has a station that runs a steady stream of caravans, including coaches designed to transport large beasts and preserving coaches that use a form of Gentle Repose to transport meat. The local Jorasco clinic is called Helping Hands. House Deneith has an office that focuses on providing security for ranchers in need, and Tharashk maintains an outpost that's mainly a waystation for private inquisitives and bounty hunters. Finally, in addition to the Farm and its many ranches, House Vadalis runs a facility formally called The College of Balinor's Gift but is more generally just called Farm School; this offers training in mundane and magical techniques of animal husbandry and veterinary medicine.",

										"When people on the frontier talk about Silver Lake, they're usually referring to the assortment of small villages and hamlets spread across the southern shore of the lake. Because Silver Lake isn't a unified town, it doesn't have a counselor or a sheriff. If there's trouble, the Lakefolk will go to Shavalant or Orcbone to seek justice\u2014though more often than not, they'll just take care of things themselves. On the whole, the Lakefolk are pragmatic, cynical, and suspicious of outsiders. Every lake village has its secrets, and they don't care to have outsiders digging them up. If you've come for fish, they've got fish for sale. But they aren't much for pleasant conversation.",

										"What's also known is that there are fey spirits in the lake... and that the communities around Silver Lake have struck bargains with these spirits. For the most part, this involves little or no active interaction between the present Lakefolk and their fey patrons. Deals were made in the distant past, and what matters now is that each village has a pact it needs to maintain to ensure the quality of its catch and the safety of its sailors. Common practice is to refer to these fey patrons as their great-grandfathers or great-grandmothers, though some villages have other customs. Much like the people of Shavalant and the Whitehorn Wood, the Lakefolk don't romanticize these relationships or have any special love for the fey. It's a simple business arrangement they need to fulfill, and some Lakefolk resent these lingering agreements. On the other hand, breaking a pact can have disastrous consequences; there are a few ghost towns along the shore, abandoned because of the enmity between the villagers and the resident fey. Most of the Lakefolk aren't especially knowledgeable about the fey and don't have a way to reliably contact their patron. The wandering Greensinger known as Briar has often sought to serve as an intermediary between the Lakefolk and their patrons, but many of the Lakefolk don't want some outsider interfering with their business. It's our waters and our bargains. You want to buy some fish? Great. If not, door's right there.",

										"A century ago, Sylbaran marked the southern border of Aundair. During the Last War, Aundair made the decision to focus its forces to the east; leaders decided that the agricultural towns to the west were expendable. Brelish troops seized Sylbaran in 950 YK and occupied the city for six years; throughout that time, bandits and Brelish pillagers wreaked havoc across the region. The Wardens of the Wood brought this chaos to an end, uniting Aundairian peasants and druids of many sects to drive out the invaders and scavengers.",
										"In 956 YK, the Warden alliance drove the Brelish troops out of Sylbaran, and now it marks the southern border of the Eldeen Reaches.

It serves as a garrison, recruiting center, and training ground for the Wardens of the Wood\u2014maintaining a force that is ready to protect the Reaches from any southern aggression, while also bringing in recruits from the smaller hamlets and farmsteads scattered around the Reaches. While the Wardens are the largest druidic sect and take the most interest in maintaining the Reaches, Sylbaran has representatives from two of the other major sects\u2014the Children of Winter and the Greensingers. While these druids use their powers to help the community, they also act as missionaries and recruiters, sharing their traditions and preparing their students for the pilgrimage into the Towering Wood. In this, it reflects the original alliance forged by the Wardens\u2014the farmers of western Aundair and the druidic initiates of the Towering Wood\u2014working together for the greater good. The notable holdout among the sects is the Ashbound; Sylbaran may be a relatively small town, but it is still too civilized and industrial for the Ashbound extremists.",
										"Warden initiates work with farmers, hunters, and fisherfolk throughout the Eldeen Reaches. Unlike the Ashbound, the Wardens don't oppose metalworking, arcane magic, or basic industry; their focus is on sustainability and minimizing damage to the environment. Gleaners use Plant Growth, Mold Earth, Druidcraft, and other rituals to enhance farming and construction. Beyond this, Sylbaran is a focal point for commerce with the southern nations. There are well developed docks to handle shipping on Silver Lake and warehouses filled with Eldeen produce waiting to be picked up by Orien caravans. Despite this, Sylbaran is unmistakably an Eldeen community. Much of Sylbaran's illumination is provided by bioluminescence. Swarms of bees support the Warden peacekeepers. The fisherfolk sing fish into their nets. While much of the town still uses the pre-Eldeen infrastructure, the newer buildings are made from shaped earth\u2014not unlike the quickstone structures of Quickstone, though not as durable. Many of these are on the edge of town, but there are a few in the center, replacing buildings that were destroyed during the Brelish occupation.",
										"Overall, the people of Sylbaran are happy folk who love their town and the natural world around it. Sylbarans know their neighbors and are always ready to lend a hand to other members of the community. They prefer harmony to strife and prefer to solve problems peacefully whenever possible. However, they're quite used to dealing with outsiders who don't share these ideals. While Sylbarans are patient with travelers, there are limits to this patience. Animal abuse (such as mistreating mounts) will not be tolerated, and someone seen pissing in the lake is likely to be thrown in it. The townsfolk stick together, and if someone sees a crime being committed, they will typically raise a hue and cry and get involved, rather than passing by. However, there are always new outsiders who don't know the ways of the Reaches, so there's always trouble to be found.",

Casual crimes and disruptions of the peace are dealt with directly by Warden Commander Dosun Oars and the Warden peacekeepers. Brawls driven by passion are largely dismissed as long as there's no lasting damage, and fighting in self-defense is acceptable. Those who commit minor crimes will be given a chance to compensate the victim of their crime and undo the damage they have done; those who are unwilling to do so will be scarred across one cheek and driven across the Eldeen River. Perpetrators of more serious crimes will receive harsher punishments; nature can be merciless, and killers who can't find a way to make up for the damage they have done may be executed.

These fragments have edges sharper than knives, and they gleam when the lightning flashes\u2014for there is always a storm looming over the plain. Look more closely, and consider the shapes of the stones; perhaps you can see the outline of a vast and terrible city built by fiends in a time long forgotten. This foul metropolis fell long before humanity rose, but one piece remains. Look from above, and you can see that this was surely the heart of the ancient city; a fortress tower, a spire of dark polished stone studded with blades and sharp edges. No mortal hand or mundane tool could shape such a thing. It is a vile relic of a forgotten age, the hand of an overlord raised in defiance. The Dhakaani named it t'Kaash, the Fist. They recognized it as a thing of evil, but even the power of the empire couldn't destroy t'Kaash. Anything that dwells in this fortress will be corrupted by it, but it has never stood empty for long; those with evil in their hearts are drawn to it, yearning for the power it offers. It has known many masters, but today it is Turakbar'Kaash\u2014Turakbar's Fist.",

Turakbar's Fist is a remnant of one of the first cities in Khorvaire\u2014the citadel of an overlord that the Droaamites call the Horned King. Everyone knows stories of how the Sovereigns defeated the ancient fiends or how these dark powers are bound by the Silver Flame; it doesn't take a Korranberg education to imagine that this Horned King may be bound beneath this spire. The people of the east often imagine the denizens of Droaam to be cruel, bloodthirsty monsters, and Turakbar's Fist has long helped drive that image.",
										"As soon as you approach the fortress, you can feel it drawing out the worst parts of you, driving mercy from your thoughts and whispering of the power you could wield if you have the strength to take it. Or perhaps you will feel courage and hope being burned away. For the Horned King is a spirit of tyranny, and if you aren't ready to be a tyrant, it brands you as a victim. Given the power of this place, some might wonder why the Daughters of Sora Kell didn't claim it themselves. Why isn't this the seat of power, instead of the Great Crag? The obvious answer is that this isn't the vision they have for Droaam. However great the power in this place, it is a place of petty tyranny. Turakbar and his Fist are a useful tool for the Daughters, certainly, but the warlord of t'Kaash will always be driven to dominate through force and terror. It is better for the Daughters that he can terrorize the east, for driven by his demons, he will shed blood one way or another.",

Furthermore, they realized that anyone who remained in the citadel for long would be corrupted by its power. As the fortress was far from civilized lands, the Church withdrew and issued an edict that the faithful should avoid the region around this dark spire. It was in the wake of this purge that t'Kaash was first claimed by the minotaur clans.",

In 778 YK, a group of medusa settlers emerged from Khyber and took possession of the ancient city. Today, Cazhaak Draal is the center of medusa culture in Droaam. While the medusas are few in number, their intelligence, discipline, and deadly power make them valuable allies for the Daughters of Sora Kell. The medusas support the Daughters' vision for a united Droaam, and they have helped to keep the more savage elements of the nation in line; even a troll will watch its temper around a medusa. Beyond this, the medusas of Cazhaak Draal are capable magewrights and especially talented stoneworkers. Across Droaam, medusa architects are devising the blueprints for the growing cities of the young nation.",
										"Cazhaak Draal lies in a region called the Stonelands. This is a harsh land in the foothills of the Byeshk Mountains, infested with cockatrices, basilisks, and other dangerous monstrosities. Once, the land was fertile; the curses of Orlassk petrified everything, and now there are stone trees and grass. In some regions, the curse holds and nothing grows, but elsewhere the stone trees are encircled by living ivy and grasses. The medusas have an affinity for the monstrosities and ways to deal with the widespread stone, so they have prospered here. None of the other inhabitants of Droaam have ever tried to challenge them for this bleak territory; aside from pilgrims devoted to the Dark Six, most creatures shun the Stonelands.",

There are few inns in the Stonelands, but many medusas will offer a traveler shelter as long as they're civil. The original metropolis of Cazhaak Draal was a sprawling city with tens of thousands of goblinoid inhabitants. The modern city occupies just a fraction of the original. Over the centuries, the medusas have explored the old city, but they have largely left the petrified Dhakaani in place. When you walk through the outer rings of Cazhaak Draal, you can experience the moment that the city fell. The inner city has been entirely rebuilt, using curving serpentine designs and patterns that showcase medusa stonework.

Cazhaak Draal includes a grand temple devoted to the Dark Six, along with smaller shrines devoted to each individual member of the six. These shrines are spread around the inner city, so that pilgrims can visit their chosen shrine without having to enter the city proper. There are also a number of monasteries and anchorite cells spread around the Stonelands, where medusa mystics contemplate the mysteries of the Six. The primary inhabitants of Cazhaak Draal are the medusas, with a strong secondary population of gargoyles; only Grimstone Keep has a larger population of gargoyles. Most other creatures find the Stonelands to be harsh and frightening; prior to the unification of Droaam, devoted pilgrims would travel to the Shrines of the Six, but few would remain. With the establishment of the new nation, Queen Sheshka has encouraged members of other species to come to Cazhaak Draal. There is a growing kobold population, along with a contingent of humans and tieflings from the Venomous Demesne. Both gargoyles and medusas are long lived but have a slow rate of reproduction; now that the population is increasing, they are beginning to reclaim the ruins around the inner city and expand Cazhaak Draal.",

										"In 870 YK, a force of Silver Flame templars discovered an ancient Dhakaani fortress that was almost perfectly preserved\u2014completely shunned by the Gaa'aram orcs and other denizens of the region. It seemed the locals were afraid of the karaguls\u2014the fearsome statues of fiendish creatures that studded the walls of the outpost and lined its halls. The templars dismissed these superstitions. They named the outpost Brightstone Keep and held it for over a century. The templars of Brightstone Keep sought to protect settlers from the east from the many threats of the region, and hunted those things they considered monsters. And so it continued until 986 YK, when Sora Katra came to Brightstone Keep and spoke to the statues on the walls... all of which were gargoyles. Most had remained dormant for thousands of years, choosing to ignore the templars in their roost. But Katra's whispers drew them from their slumber and promised rewards for their loyalty. Roused from their sleep, the gargoyles drove out the templars and claimed the fortress as their own. As the conflict between Droaam and Breland escalated, the Daughters sent troops to garrison the fortress, under the authority of the gargoyle warlord Cairngorm.",
										"Grimstone Keep is home to the largest population of gargoyles in Khorvaire, including both the original gargoyles of Brightstone Keep and others who were originally scattered across the region. The warlord Cairngorm is actively working to foster a sense of cultural identity among the gargoyles, and is encouraging the exploration of art and the celebration of storytelling, a favorite pastime among the stonefolk. Cairngorm has also been pushing the gargoyles to explore their own potential. There are rumors that the gargoyle warlord has been engaging in disturbing experiments with demonglass or fiendish possession\u2014that Cairngorm is drawing on some power of Khyber in this pursuit of gargoyle perfection\u2014but these are merely rumors.",
										"Grimstone Keep is an active fortress, not unlike Orcbone. The core population of gargoyles is supplemented by a force of other humanoids. Goblins and kobolds work on maintenance and support. A mixed force of orcs, shifters, ogres, and other creatures stands ready for any general military operations, along with an elite force of Znir gnolls and a squad of war trolls tasked to protect Cairngorm. The gargoyles themselves provide aerial support and scouting, as well as carrying messages between major outposts. With this in mind, Grimstone Keep isn't designed for the entertainment of travelers. The gargoyles socialize with one another, and everyone is welcome in their storytelling circles. Droaamites can get shelter and grist at Grimstone Keep, but traveling easterners will have to camp outside the fortress walls.",

												"\"The Misplaced Village\" is a Brelish fairytale, a variation of the story of the Forgotten Prince. In this version, the Traveler visits a village plagued by bandits and war and offers to hide them from their enemies, promising \"No one will ever find you.\" The villagers eagerly accept the offer, only coming to realize, as the ritual was taking effect, that the gifts of the Traveler always have a price. And so it came to pass: The village disappeared... And no one ever found it again.",
												"The purpose of this story is to highlight the dangers of trusting strangers and the need to consider the consequences of the bargains you make. No one in the Five Nations thought it was based on anything real... Until the Daughters of Sora Kell first summoned their chosen warlords to the Great Crag, and a changeling shifted through a handful of forms before showing its (presumably) true face and introducing itself as the Warlord of Lost. Others in Droaam were already familiar with Lost\u2014Sora Teraza had come to the village to forge the initial alliance\u2014but the powers of the east were surprised to learn that there was an entire community of shapeshifters they knew nothing about. In the years that have followed, the changelings of Lost have become an important part of the Daughters' regime. Changelings often serve as Katra's Voice or Teraza's Eyes, gathering information or using their gifts to fill the classic role of the bard, sharing news with different communities and raising spirits. While the denizens of Lost are part of Droaam society, Lost itself remains shrouded in mystery. Reliable accounts claim that the village is mobile and alive\u2014that the houses of Lost are a massive form of mimic known as facades. According to the stories, these facades can assume the shapes of anything from a tent to a hut to a wagon. Thus, within moments, Lost could shift from looking like a camp of gnolls to being a wagon train, and as a train it can move to a new location. Thus, any small community could potentially be Lost. It's also believed that the facades of Lost are naturally resistant to divination, which has helped hide the village from potential enemies.",
												"So what's known about Lost is that it's a small community of changelings that can hide in plain sight and move whenever it chooses to. The changelings of Lost possess telepathic gifts that allow them to communicate silently and to read the thoughts of others, which helps them maintain their deception. They excel in the creation of mutable materials: Shiftweave, Glamoured Armor, Hats of Disguise, and anything in this vein; an assassin from Lost may have a walking stick that can turn into a rapier. Stories further suggest that at least some of the changelings of Lost are exceptional thieves, and that over the course of centuries they have stolen many interesting things from across Khorvaire; if you're looking for a lost relic of the Silver Flame or the scepter of the Dhakaani emperor, it's possible it's hidden away in Lost. The motives of the changelings of Lost remain enigmatic. Many familiar with the situation doubt that the \"Warlord of Lost\" is an individual, guessing that it's a constructed identity shared by all the changelings of Lost when it's needed. Some question if there's any way to know that Lost is just one village, or if there could in fact be a half-dozen shapeshifting villages moving around Droaam. Ultimately, what matters is that Lost is out there\u2014and that potentially any small village you encounter in Droaam could be Lost.",

Some say it was a changeling of Lost who gave Tira Miron her sword Kloijner (unlikely) and who presented Breggan Blackcrown with the crown of Breggor Firstking (quite possible).",
																"The changelings of Lost work to hone their telepathic abilities. Most possess telepathy with a range of 60 feet and the ability to cast Detect Thoughts at will. If you're playing a changeling from Lost, you can choose to develop these powers by taking the Telepathy feat presented in Tasha's Cauldron of Everything.",
																"Changelings from Lost may have other remarkable abilities. Some have the talents of bards, specializing in enchantment, illusion, and transmutation. Others learn to assume beast forms, much like a Circle of the Moon druid. So if you're searching for Lost, keep in mind that even beasts could be the villagers you're looking for!"

												"Shaarat Kol is a city in southwestern Droaam, set against and into the western face of the Graywall Mountains. Like Cazhaak Draal, it is built on the foundations of an ancient Dhakaani city; unlike Cazhaak Draal, far more of the original city remains intact. The city was either abandoned or completely depopulated during the wars with the daelkyr. Those parts of the city that were above ground were damaged by battle and the passage of time. At one point, an ogre chieftain built a simple fortress within these ruins, and this changed hands many times over the centuries. But much of Shaarat Kol was underground, and in its final days its gates were sealed with both Arcane Locks and adamantine bars. None of the chibs and chieftains who claimed the fortress on the surface were ever able to delve below. None, that is, until Kethelrax the Cunning came along. In 985 YK, Kethelrax was the leader of a band of goblins and kobolds\u2014rebels hiding in the Graywall Mountains and raiding the thuggish chibs. One day, Sora Katra came to his camp, and the two talked for hours. In the month that followed, Kethelrax led his followers in a daring attack against the ogres and their ettin chib who held the ruins of Shaarat Kol. It was a vicious fight, but Kethelrax's forces won the day and claimed the fortress... and using the knowledge Katra had shared, Kethelrax was able to open the gates of the old city and discover the true face of Shaarat Kol.",
												"The name of the city is Goblin for \"Forge of Swords\" and it was once an industrial center of the Dhakaani, home to some of their greatest forge adepts. The city was largely intact and contained resources untouched for thousands of years; while many of these resources were lost to time, adamantine doesn't age. However, the city was lost during war, and the ancient daashors left countless traps along with their treasures. There are amazing facilities and other wonders to be found in Shaarat Kol, but claiming them is a slow process. Even now, more than a decade later, the denizens of Shaarat Kol have only reclaimed an estimated 20% of the ancient city.",
												"At the moment, Sharaat Kol is essentially two cities. The Upper City is on the surface, which is being expanded and rebuilt in the new Droaamite style seen in Graywall and the Great Crag. Most of the people of the city live in the Upper City and it's where most business takes place. But there's also the Undercity, which lies beyond the ancient gates. This is where Kethelrax holds court and where his most loyal and talented followers dwell. Should there ever be a serious attack, Kethelrax could seal the gates\u2014and when those gates were last sealed, they held off intruders for thousands of years.",
												"The Upper City of Shaarat Kol is a haven for trade, known for the vast Goblin Market. This is an even larger cousin of the Bloody Market found in Graywall. All manner of independent artisans, hunters, and magewrights sell their goods and services. You can hire mercenaries, buy plunder from raiders, browse trinkets scavenged from Dhakaani ruins, or barter for dangerous imports from the Venomous Demesne. The Goblin Market is a vast open space largely filled with tents and temporary housing. Looking at the permanent buildings, roughly two-thirds of the structures are built for the comfort of small creatures, with another third of the city being designed to accommodate medium and large creatures. Kethelrax has sworn that Shaarat Kol will be a haven for goblins and kobolds, long oppressed in this region; he's building this city first and foremost for his people. The Undercity of Shaarat Kol uses the intact infrastructure of the ancient Dhakaani city. This was an industrial center and it contains mines, foundries, and forges. Kethelrax and his people are working to restore these facilities and to make use of them. While some of the great daashors were hobgoblins, the golin'dar (goblins) were the primary artisans of the empire, and much of the city is designed for their comfort. As noted before, the process of reclaiming the Undercity is slow, and there are always teams at work exploring new sections and trying to clear out traps and defenses. But just in the area that's been reclaimed, Kethelrax has been able to get a foundry and an ore processing facility working, and they are learning a great deal about the process the Dhakaani used to create and work adamantine. This is only the start, but Shaarat Kol has the potential to play a very important role in the future of Droaam.",
												"Unlike Graywall, Shaarat Kol has made little effort to welcome the Five Nations. There's no Orien trade route and no Dragonmarked outposts in the City of Goblins. The coastline to the south is rocky and dangerous, and it is difficult for large ships to land. Kethelrax is actively working to construct a safe port so that Shaarat Kol can rival Vralkek as an important shipping destination. For now, there are a few safe havens for those who know them, but they only support small ships. All this means that the people of the Five Nations who come to Shaarat Kol are mainly smugglers. There are all kinds of valuable goods available in the Goblin Market, including many that are taxed or prohibited in the Five Nations. Some smugglers trek paths and hidden passages through the Graywall Mountains, while others dare travel the dangerous coastline in small boats. While Kethelrax and the Daughters haven't tried to bring the Dragonmarked Houses to Shaarat Kol, he's happy to deal with legitimate traders, hence his work on the port; he just wants to finish securing the Undercity and unlocking its potential before bringing easterners into the city in large numbers.",
												"Goblins and kobolds make up nearly 90% of the population of Shaarat Kol. Many of these were formerly subjugated by brutal chibs, and either fled on their own or were released from their bondage by the Daughters and allowed to go to Shaarat Kol. There is a tremendous sense of camaraderie among the people of the city; throughout the city you'll see people working together and helping their neighbors. There's only a small (literally) city watch, but that's because anywhere there's trouble, a mob of citizens will come together to deal with the problem. There are a number of large trade schools that are teaching the skills needed to use the facilities of the Undercity, and Kethelrax has brought in mentors from the Khaar'paal kobold clan to help other kobolds harness their sorcerous potential. As a result, Shaarat Kol has far more magewrights than any other city in Droaam. The city is still growing and finding its footing, but there are more casual comforts than one can find even in the Great Crag. The denizens of Shaarat Kol have largely embraced the faith of the Cazhaak Six, and there's a temple maintained by the medusa priest Shalaasa and a number of Khaar'paal adepts. In general, Shaarat Kol is one of the safest cities in Droaam, as long as you don't start any trouble. On the other hand, the camaraderie among the small denizens means that the criminals and con artists of Shaarat Kol ply their trade on the visiting tall-folk; keep an extra eye on your purse and don't buy a deed to a Byeshk mine, no matter how good the price is.",

This could lead to a deadly conflict between Kethelrax and the Kech Dhakaan. It's quite likely that agents of the Shaarat'khesh are already hidden among the people of Shaarat Kol, evaluating the situation and passing information along to the clans.",

														"The society of the Demesne is governed by the four mazes: The Maze of Mysteries, the Maze of Promises, the Maze of Making and the Maze of Faith.

														"The aesthetic of the Demesne is distinctly alien and its buildings couldn't exist without the use of magic; architecture involves levitation, transmutation, and the use of teleportation and extradimensional spaces.",
														"While it is small\u2014in part because of strict population control\u2014the Venomous Demesne is significantly more advanced than the Five Nations. Each maze pursues a different branch of mystical science, and the fruits of that work are applied across the Demesne. Overall, spell effects of up to 5th level can be seen at work in daily life and effects of up to 7th level can be encountered. Teleportation Circles link different parts of the Demesne. Dead nobles can be resurrected in the Maze of Faith. Planar travel isn't common, but the Maze of Promises deals with fiends (mostly Daanvian), efreet, archfey, and other planar powers. Common magic items truly are common, and the Maze of Making can produce rare or even legendary items\u2014though they lack the industrial capacity of House Cannith and can't mass-produce these things."
													]
												},
												"That last point is important. The Demesne is more advanced than the Five Nations, but it is limited in many ways. Much of its magic and arcane science is tied to disturbing traditions, ancient pacts, and the blood of the tieflings themselves; it's not simply that the mazes refuse to share their power with non-tieflings, it's that they can't share their power with non-tieflings. Practices that seem cruel and unusual to outsiders are necessary to generate and maintain the powers they rely on. It is a place of arcane wonders, but the deeper you dig, the more disturbing it becomes.",
												"Given the isolationist nature of the Demesne, this is the extent of common knowledge about it. Smugglers are always keen to acquire goods from the Venomous Demesne\u2014whether drugs, arcane weapons, or simply curious trinkets\u2014but few will ever see the Demesne itself.

But it's not an entirely arbitrary line. The environment does suddenly shift as you head west of the Graywall Mountains, becoming drier and harsher. On a map, it looks like an entirely uniform region, a vast unending plain. In truth, it is more diverse. While much of the Barrens is made up of plains covered with scrub grass, there are stone features across the region; not mountains (except for the Great Crag, of course), but mesas and low ridges. There are also a number of deep chasms\u2014cracks possibly caused by ancient tectonic activity, creating canyons that divide the plains. Sometimes these cracks in the earth are less than a foot across, and simply require a little caution. On the other hand, the Korlaac Rift is a massive chasm that runs for nearly 60 miles. The Rift has an average depth of around 2,600 feet, but there are points where it's far deeper; some say it drops down into Khyber itself. The Rift lies between Graywall and the Great Crag; the western trade road runs to Korlaac Pass, a bridge that spans the four hundred foot gap of the chasm. In addition to these cracks, there are a number of craters that drop down into darkness; these are called gantii'shu, \"hungry holes,\" as the edges can collapse without warning.",

Prior to the Daughters of Sora Kell and their seemingly endless supply of grist, it would have been difficult to support a population the size of Graywall. Most settlements across the barrens are small hamlets housing two or three extended families, spread far enough apart so as not to be competing with neighbors for the limited resources. However, there are stretches of the Barrens that are truly barren\u2014regions of gray sand or bare stone, where all vegetation withers and dies. There's no environmental logic to the placement of these regions, which the locals call kurarat, \"dead lands.\" Many scholars believe that these swathes are the result of some ancient conflict, perhaps the war between the Dhakaani and the daelkyr.

												"The Byeshk Mountains form a natural barrier between Droaam and the Towering Wood of the Eldeen Reaches. This range is considerably less hospitable than the Graywall Mountains to the south. The peaks are high and the cliffs are often both sheer and exceptionally hard; the unusual density of the stone makes both the mining and the creation of artificial passes difficult. The net result of this is that the Byeshk Mountains are an especially favorable habitat for flying creatures, which is likely why they have long been dominated by harpies. Harpy aeries and monasteries are always in places that cannot be reached by landbound creatures, at least not without making a perilous climb.",
												"The civilization of the Droaamite harpies is broken into flights, clans that share unique traditions and bloodlines. While there are many flights that call the Byeshk Mountains home, there are two that make their home near the frontier. The Brass Talon flight holds the southeastern edge of the Byeshk Mountains, the range along the Western Frontier. The Brass Talons are fierce warriors whose combat techniques are similar to the bardic Colleges of Swords and Valor, but the Talons rarely attack without cause; they are a monastic flight who strive to perfect the dance of song, sword, and flight. Travelers will often hear their distant songs, but unless shrines are desecrated, the Talons will usually ignore them. The Wind Howlers are another story. Their territory is to the west, slightly further from the frontier. However, they are an aggressive flight that loves to prey upon the landbound, and harpy reavers often head east to raid. The Wind Howlers are deadly archers and excel at instilling fear in their targets; their bardic traditions are similar to those of the Colleges of Lore and Whispers.",
												"The Byeshk Mountains are noteworthy for their rich deposits of byeshk, an exotic purplish ore with special properties. Glittering purple veins can be seen on cliff faces, thus leading to the name of the range; while beautiful, these surface veins are often \"false purple\"\u2014thin traces that lack the mystical properties of the deeper veins. While there are a few mines in the range, the unusual density of the stone makes it difficult to carry out mining operations, and thus there are far fewer mines\u2014both active and ancient\u2014than in the Graywall Mountains.",

In addition to the treasures she's amassed over her long life, Maenya is also said to bind the souls of her victims to their skulls and to keep them as trophies.

												"The Graywall Mountains (often just called \"The Graywall\") form a significant natural barrier between Droaam and Breland. These mountains were once an important hub for the ancient goblin civilizations, even before the Empire of Dhakaan; if you know your history, you may know that this is where Jhazaal Dhakaan united six warring kings and truly founded the empire. Because of this, the Graywall Mountains are riddled with ancient ruins\u2014Dhakaani cities and fortifications, but also the remnants of even older goblin settlements. However, in the present day, the mountains are almost completely devoid of goblinoids. Historians speculate that the Graywall saw some of the worst conflicts of the Xoriat Incursion\u2014that the majority of the peoples of that time were either completely wiped out or fled into the Barrens. This may be why there are so few hobgoblins and bugbears in Droaam when compared to Darguun, and why the goblins of Droaam have so little attachment to Dhakaani history. Some of the ruins in the Graywall Mountains have been reclaimed by other creatures; in particular, the Khaar'paal kobolds have established a number of subterranean strongholds within the Graywall. Recently, the warlord Kethelrax the Cunning took possession of the ancient city of Shaarat Kol. Other ruins remain undiscovered and undisturbed. But such places may hold deadly traps placed by the Dhakaani in their final days\u2014or more dangerous still, remnants of the forces the daelkyr unleashed in that ancient war.",
												"The Graywall Mountains hold veins of many useful metals, including iron, copper, byeshk, and the various constituent metals used to create adamantine and mithral. There are also a number of significant deposits of mutable quickstone, which was the original reason the town of Quickstone was founded. However, it's also the case that many of the most accessible deposits were discovered and exploited long ago by the Dhakaani. There are still rich veins to be found, but there's also a maze of abandoned goblin mines that may be entirely depleted.",
												"Another remarkable thing about the Graywall Mountains is the unusual number of powerful manifest zones. Glaciers in the high mountains often conceal manifest zones tied to Risia. Kobek's Voice is a dramatically active volcano connected to Fernia. There are a number of zones tied to Lamannia (which some say are the origin of the mutable mineral known as quickstone), and a number of old stories strongly suggest that there are a few intense Thelanian manifest zones hidden in the mountains.",
												"Notable inhabitants of the Graywall Mountains include gargoyles, Khaar'paal kobolds, ogres, and hill giants; the hill giants of Khorvaire appear to be an offshoot of the ogre and to have no ties to the giants of Xen'drik. Throughout the history of the Barrens, ogres have often come down from the mountains to dominate the smaller creatures of the plains; as it turns out, these chibs were just repeating the pattern they knew from the mountains, where hill giants dominate ogre clans. While the Khaar'paal kobolds have a sophisticated culture, the Graywall ogres are more primal; they don't work metal, and generally employ tools of wood and stone. While there are aggressive clans, not all ogres are hostile to outsiders; a number of the Graywall clans are peaceful hunter- gatherers, who may be excited to host tiny visitors with interesting stories and songs. The Graywall Mountains also include powerful predators, including griffons, giant eagles, and wyverns. There are also unconfirmed rumors of giants in the mountains who are more powerful and sophisticated than the hill giants\u2014but for now, these are only stories.",
												"There are many hidden paths under and through the Graywall that are known to Brelish smugglers, often making use of stretches of abandoned Dhakaani tunnels or mines. If you're a former smuggler, you surely know some of these crossings. Otherwise, if you need to find a quick path through the mountains, you can surely find a guide at the Crown in Quickstone...",

Two of the figures are damaged, but the others remain intact. Raiders often camp at the base of the Six Kings, believing that doing so brings luck to bold warriors. Stories say there's a network of passages below the monument, where the ghosts of the kings will test any champion who dares to enter\u2014and that those few who survive may return with an ancient Dhakaani weapon.",

It's said that only those in desperate need\u2014those who have nothing left but hope\u2014can find the hidden passages that lead to this paradise.

In the heart of Nasaar Kol, all effects that would produce Bright Light only produce Dim Light; you may still be able to see the sun, but it is washed out and weak. There is a wide, weak manifest zone tied to Mabar that generates this effect. Within the area, there are points where the Mabaran connection is more intense. The influence of Dolurrh is also strong here, but scattered into dozens of sharp points. There are pools of gray mist where the voices of the dead can be heard whispering; usually, this is an unintelligible babel, but occasionally a clear voice can be heard through the rabble.",

The dirge singer Iraala and her lover Muurat led this effort. Much as the modern Seekers of the Divinity Within are able to contain the dangerous effects of Mabaran manifest zones, Iraala and her students worked on understanding and harnessing the powers of death and darkness. There is a massive ruined outpost at the heart of this region, but there are also a handful of smaller ruins scattered throughout\u2014places where the Dar experimented with the same sort of skeletal labor seen in Seeker communities, or where mediums plumbed the mysteries of the whispering pools. But the Dhakaani were forced to abandon the region during the Xoriat Incursion. The daelkyr and their forces shattered the fortress and scattered the people, and the restless dead and hungry shadows rose with deadly vigor.",
												"Today, this region is brutally haunted and exceptionally dangerous. Shadows are drawn to the living, and if you enter Nasaar Kol it's only a matter of time before your shadows will turn on you. There are wights drawn from fallen Dhakaani soldiers, still fighting a war they lost thousands of years ago. And there are countless spirits leaking out of Dolurrh. Some are just wisps of whispering mist. Others are full-fledged ghosts. These restless spirits aren't as predatory as their Mabaran counterparts, but they are usually confused and driven by the most powerful emotions or moments of their lives; they can be just as dangerous to living creatures that cross their path. All of these things become more intense as you head deeper into the region, and the ancient keep is teeming with wraiths and wights. Thanks to this host of deadly spirits, Droaamites and Brelish alike avoid Nasaar Kol. Occasionally Seekers or other necromancers delve into it, searching for Dhakaani relics or planar-charged resources. Others hope to speak to those they have lost in the pools of mist. But crossing into Nasaar Kol means dancing with death, and the wise avoid it. There is little flora or fauna in Nasaar Kol. There are shadows of rats and other creatures scurrying in the shadows, harbingers of the more powerful undead. And there is a strain of assassin vine that's sustained by the energies of Mabar but craves the blood of the living\u2014one more threat to watch out for.",

												"Silver Lake is a massive inland lake. Along with the Byeshk Mountains, it forms the northern border of the Western Frontier. There are small fishing villages spread along the shore of Silver Lake, as well as the Eldeen city of Sylbaran; these are discussed earlier in this chapter. But the lake itself is truly remarkable. In the early days of Galifar, the Arcane Congress confirmed that there is a powerful manifest zone tied to Thelanis at the center of Silver Lake. This results in a strong fey presence throughout the lake. Most of the lake villages have pacts with resident fey, ensuring safe passage for their boats and good fishing hauls; those who anger the local fey can suffer a wide range of misfortunes. But these are minor fey that cling to the shore. There are greater powers at the center of the lake. Remember that Thelanis isn't just about the fey; it is the realm of stories, founded on faerie tales that leak out into the world. People say there's a massive serpent in the center of Silver Lake that can shatter ships and swallow sailors\u2014and that one sailor lived for a year in the belly of the beast before finding a way to escape and swim home. There are stories of warships vanishing and of ancient vessels being discovered with no evidence of the passage of time. There are tales of golden fish that can grant wishes and of a grand castle that can only be seen in the reflections on the water. All of these things might actually exist in the heart of Silver Lake, but they are as ephemeral and unreliable as any story. If that serpent exists, it may sleep at the bottom of the lake\u2014or it could spend most of its time in the oceans of Thelanis, only shifting into Eberron under special circumstances.",
												"What is certain is that it's dangerous to cross Silver Lake unless you're very familiar with it. You're safe enough while you're in sight of shore, though it helps if someone on the boat has a bargain with one of the lake spirits. Crossing the deeper waters is always a risk. Sailors in the region know to avoid fog banks, to throw silver overboard at the first sign of a storm, and a hundred other superstitions that can help mitigate the dangers of the deep water. If you venture into the deepest waters unprepared, anything could happen.",

There have been no confirmed sightings of this beast for centuries, and there are many who insist that the stories of a bear the size of a castle are at best exaggerations or at worst absolute fabrications. Whatever the truth, it is a concrete fact that there is a powerful Lamannian manifest zone on the northern edge of the wood. This accelerates the growth of animals and plants, and undermines any attempts to cut back the forest or introduce the trappings of civilization within it. Beasts often seem to be guided by some greater force which coordinates their actions to deal with anyone who would despoil the wood\u2014though when people have used Speak with Animals to talk to these beasts, they deny being actively controlled and say that whatever they were doing \"just seemed like the right thing to do.\"",

People say that the wood just doesn't like people, whether they're druids or lumberjacks. The people who live near Whitehorn do harvest and hunt on the edges of the wood, but everyone knows not to take too much from the Wood or to go too deep within it. With that said, there are exceptions to any rule. Perhaps a cell of the Swords of Liberty or a troop of brigands have come to terms with Whitehorn and are using the wood as a safe haven.

Dane is an apocryphal figure; some say he was a bard who wandered the streets of Sharn, while others insist that he advised Galifar I himself during the war of unification. Whatever the truth may be, Beggar Dane is a beloved Brelish everyman, and his wisdom is celebrated in Brelish taverns and homes every day. But now, in 998 YK, there is a new Beggar Dane; an anonymous figure who speaks on behalf of the Swords of Liberty, a widespread network of insurgents who rail against the Brelish monarchy. Some believe that this Beggar Dane is a fictional figurehead, a mask that can be used by any cell leader. But the Sharn Inquisitive has done a deep investigation into the Swords of Liberty, and they are convinced that Beggar Dane is one person\u2014a mastermind who is coordinating the actions of the western Swords cells. The Inquisitive further believes that Beggar Dane is driving the increasingly violent actions of the Swords.",
												"The Swords of Liberty began as a peaceful political movement, calling for King Boranel to voluntarily cede power to the Brelish parliament. In 996 YK, a statement from Beggar Dane took credit for an attack on Castle Arakhain that left the east wing of the Winter Palace in flames. Over the last two years, the Swords of Liberty have struck at nobles across Breland, stating that there will be no peace until the aristocracy is dissolved. According to Beggar Dane, even that victory wouldn't mean the end of violence. Beggar Dane accuses King Boranel of betraying the Brelish people both by accepting the terms of the Treaty of Thronehold and providing shelter for Cyran refugees. Dane maintains that Breland could have easily won the Last War if its leaders had truly wished to do so; in certain tracts, he suggests that there is a conspiracy among all the Wyrnarn monarchs, that Boranel has intentionally misled his nation to benefit his royal cousins. He promises that once the monarchy is overthrown, the new army of the common people will bring unity to all of Khorvaire\u2014and that they will deal with both the \"monsters to the west\" (Droaam) and the \"enemy we have welcomed in\" (Cyrans).",
												"Beggar Dane's identity is a closely guarded secret. He's mainly known through the proclamations that supporters share in villages and farms. However, a masked figure claiming to be Beggar Dane has spoken at rallies and been seen during Swords attacks. According to these reports, he's a male human or half- elf; as he's masked and shielded against divination, little else is known. Beggar Dane is believed to be on the Western Frontier and there are many in the west who support his actions, even if they aren't willing to take up arms for his cause. Whether or not you've ever seen Beggar Dane, if you have been on the frontier for long, you've certainly heard of him.",

The Black Crown are a force of brigands; they may avoid the law, but they don't hide who they are or what they're doing. By contrast, the Swords of Liberty are covert insurgents whose members are hidden in communities across Breland. The Black Crowns defy Brelish law, but they're interested in lining their pockets, not in driving political change; the Swords of Liberty are only interested in change, and every violent action they take advances that agenda.",

The core of the company were members of an elite unit of Brelish soldiers stationed at Orcbone. Their captain, Breggan, regularly ignored her orders and waged her own personal guerrilla war against Droaam, slaughtering goblin villages and leaving gruesome displays that could chill even a medusa's blood. Some stories say that Breggan sought to avenge the slaughter of her own family at the hands of monstrous raiders. Others suggest that she admired the ferocity of her foes, that in seeking to match their cruelty she became a monster herself.

												"Ardev is the ancestral seat of the ir'Blis line. Thavius ir'Blis is the ruling count of the Western Frontier, formally styled as the Shield of the Graywall in recognition of his responsibility over this border region. In his youth, Thavius led troops on the northern front. Then came the Daughters of Sora Kell. In 986 YK, Countess Thalia ir'Blis (the mother of Thavius) personally led the Westwind Riders to deal with the forces that had claimed the town of Stubborn (now known as Stonejaw). The countess and all of her troops were killed, and the Daughters retaliated with a devastating attack on Orcbone. Thavius was called back to Ardev, both to assume the position of Count and to defend the west against this new threat. He didn't stand alone; King Boranel sent troops to reinforce this new front line. While these forces were necessary to defend the border against the unexpected power of Droaam, they were servants of the king, not the count. Thavius served with distinction both on the field of battle and as a commander, but he could only control the forces under his command and chafed at the poor decisions of the eastern soldiers. Breggan Blackcrown is a key example of this: The bandit queen originally served under Lord Veirner ir'Tajar of Orcbone, and Thavius holds ir'Tajar responsible both for Breggan's conduct during the war and her current brigandry. With the current de-escalation of hostilities, most of the royal forces have been withdrawn; but Lord Veirner has been retained as the Viscount of Orcbone, and Argonth has been assigned to the region.",
												"The ir'Blis line has governed this region since Galifar was founded. It has always been a vast and largely empty county; even before Droaam, the Barrens to the west were a dangerous, unclaimed land. The rise of Droaam as a nation has been a tremendous blow to the ir'Blis family. While it was largely undeveloped, they saw the Western Frontier as their domain. Now that land has been claimed by a new and powerful nation. Orcbone has been stripped from the domain and granted to an eastern noble\u2014and aside from his wounded pride, the count despises ir'Tajar. Quickstone has gone from being a backwater smuggler's haven to a boom town drawing in the dragonmarked houses. Count ir'Blis wants to do what's best for his people, but he is still trying to determine what that even is. He yearns for vengeance against Droaam and the Daughters of Sora Kell, but he recognizes that his people need peace\u2014and that there's no telling how a true war with Droaam would end.",
												"At the end of the day, Count Thavius ir'Blis is quintessentially Brelish. He is proud, but his pragmatism comes first. He upholds the law, but is willing to overlook the work of an honest smuggler; he knew what he was doing when he allowed the Three Faces of Coin to have a foothold in Quickstone. He showed charity to Cyran refugees, but he also placed them on the border with Droaam\u2014setting them between his own people and an unknown threat. Keep this in mind when dealing with the count: He is a soldier who has commanded troops in battle. He takes his station seriously. But above all, he is a practical man who does what's best for his people and his family. Count ir'Blis is largely respected by the people of the frontier. He is seen as a just man, from a family that's never been too heavy handed. But the people of the frontier are an independent lot. The Swords of Liberty are strong in this region; even if its members don't see the count as a villain, he is still a brick in a wall they're going to tear down. Some are angry that the count isn't leading an army against Droaam; others are afraid that he can't protect them from the nation of monsters. And they may be right.",

If you grew up on the Western Frontier, you grew up hearing stories about the Daughters\u2014how Sora Maenya consumes children who stray from the path, how Sora Katra knows every time a lie is told. . . and how she may come in the dark to steal the teeth or eat the fingers of those who lie. You know how Sora Maenya killed a dragon with her bare hands and then ate the whole thing. The Daughters of Sora Kell aren't just monsters; they are the monsters you were taught to fear as a child, the monsters you believed were lurking in the shadows outside your window and the darkness below your bed. And now those monsters live next door and have an army of armored ogres and bloodthirsty trolls. It's an idea that takes some getting used to. Some superstitious settlers refuse to mention Sora Teraza by name, believing that it draws her attention; if they must discuss her for some reason, they call her \"the blind queen.\" A few take this further, referring to Sora Maenya as \"the mighty queen\" and Sora Katra as \"the beautiful queen.\"",

They're the mothers of the nation. Yes, they demand respect, and yes, they may tear you apart and eat you if you step out of line, but that's why you should respect your grandmother! Droaamites take pride in the fact that their grandmothers terrify the people of the east. Having said that, this does depend on where you're from. The medusas of Cazhaak Draal and the tieflings of the Venomous Demesne largely see themselves as equal partners in the Droaam experiment; they respect the Daughters, but don't idolize them. And there are certainly a handful of former chibs who despise the hags, or dream of unseating them and stealing their crowns.

												"Kethelrax the Cunning, a red-scaled kobold, is the warlord of Shaarat Kol. Sometimes called the Goblin Prince, Kethelrax has been a rallying figure for people who have been oppressed throughout the history of the region. Kethelrax was born into one of the Khaar'paal kobold clans of the Graywall Mountains. Gifted with sorcerous power, these kobolds have largely remained in their fortified tunnels, ignoring both the humans to the east and the raiders to the west. Young Kethelrax was curious and keen to explore the western lands\u2014but soon after he ventured into the Barrens, he was taken prisoner by an ogre chib who dominated a village of kobolds and goblins. Kethelrax served this ogre for a time, learning the ways of the Barrens and his oppressed cousins. Before the Daughters exerted their influence over the land, the Barrens were violent and unstable; the ogre chib was in turn slain by minotaur raiders, who took Kethelrax and some of the others back with them to the fortress that was then known as Haalrac's Fist. Kethelrax had many opportunities to escape; he'd been honing his sorcerous talents throughout his time in the western lands, and his captors had no idea of what he was capable of. But Kethelrax wasn't content to escape alone. As a servant, he managed to manipulate the warrior Turakbar, playing on the minotaur's ego. Kethelrax convinced Turakbar to slaughter the reigning clan lord, Haalrac, and in the ensuing chaos, the kobold was able to free a host of goblins, kobolds, and others forced into service in Haalrac's Fist. Kethelrax led this band south, hoping he could convince the Khaar'paal to take in these refugees. But during the long journey, Kethelrax was visited by a blind hag who urged him to take shelter in some Dhakaani ruins in the foothills of the Graywall Mountains. Sora Teraza told Kethelrax that change was coming to the Barrens\u2014and that there was a need for a leader who could inspire the small folk of the Barrens, rallying goblins and kobolds alike. Over the next few years, Kethelrax and his band targeted weak chibs in the region, freeing their prisoners and building a significant force. It wasn't easy, and Kethelrax suffered a number of bloody defeats\u2014but he and his people remained strong. In 985 YK, Sora Katra came to Kethelrax. She explained the Daughter's vision for the region, and made a bargain with Kethelrax: If he could seize the fortress now known as Shaarat Kol, he could hold it as a warlord of Droaam, creating a haven for goblins and kobolds. Kethelrax agreed, and over a decade later he still reigns as the Goblin Prince of Shaarat Kol.",
												"Kethelrax the Cunning lives up to his epithet. He is both clever and charismatic, able to inspire his people but equally adept at deceiving his enemies. His primary motive is always to improve the lives of the kobolds and goblins of the western plains, and this has led him to be one of the most trusted allies of the Daughters of Sora Kell. While some warlords chafe at the Daughters' rule and yearn for greater power, Kethelrax recognizes that a strong and united Droaam holds many opportunities for his people. He continues to improve Shaarat Kol, working to make it a haven for both smugglers and honest traders. With that said, he still has a number of old scores he'd like to settle with those chibs and warlords that have long oppressed the small folk. He has so far been unable to convince the Khaar'paal kobolds to ally with the Daughters, but he continues to work to win them over.",

He's known for his ability to conjure blades of flame (something that mimics both Flame Blade and Fire Bolt, as he can fling his fiery daggers).

The Kor'mur (\"Blood Horns\") interpretation of the Horned King is a tyrant who rules through bloodsoaked intimidation, and Turakbar follows this example. He revels in his role as a champion of dark powers. His horns and armor are engraved with glowing runes, and he enjoys crushing the life from his foes with his massive clawed gauntlet. But those who have met him can attest to the fact that he's more than just a bloodsoaked brute.

When the hostilities between Breland and Droaam were at their height, Rhesh Turakbar raided deep into Brelish territory, sowing terror and burning supplies. Today, Turakbar and his forces primarily patrol the border between Droaam and Breland, but they also regularly raid into Brelish territory. They generally remain north of Graywall, avoiding the main trade road\u2014but anything else is fair game. They rarely actually take anything in their raids, and they often wound or maim victims rather than killing them; their goal is fear, not plunder. The Daughters of Sora Kell claim that these raids are the fault of Breland for refusing to recognize Droaam and thus allowing for an absolute determination of borders; they say the violence is Breland's fault, both for settling too far west and for refusing to include Droaam in the Treaty of Thronehold.",

										"There are few trappings of faith on the frontier. Churches aren't the gilded citadels you can find in Sharn or Flamekeep. The simple fact is that the people of Breland have always been cynical and pragmatic, never ones to believe that their destiny is in the hands of divine forces. And yet, on the frontier, you're far from the comfort and security that comes easily in the big cities, and there's a comfort to believing in something greater than yourself\u2014in believing that there is a higher power guiding or working through you, that you have been granted a divine gift or charged with a purpose. Beyond that, a shared faith helps hold a community together, which is important in a small village where everyone needs to depend on one another. The holidays of the Sovereign Host are described in chapter 3, and while celebrations may not be as grand as their counterparts in Fairhaven or Wroat, these feasts and festivals are often important to a community in a way they simply aren't in the east. The Sovereign Host is the dominant faith of the Brelish population, while the worship of the Dark Six\u2014particularly the interpretation known as the Cazhaak Six\u2014is a common faith within Droaam.",
										"However, especially within Droaam, there are a host of lesser traditions. The minotaurs of Turakbar's Fist are devoted to the fiend they call the Horned King. The gnolls of the Znir Pact refuse to bow to any god or demon; in place of shrines, they raise piles of stones to represent the idols shattered by their ancestors, and they stare at these cairns and meditate upon their freedom. In general, the people are indulgent of the beliefs of others, even if they don't like them. The Znir gnoll despises fiends, but they'll still work with a warlock-priest of the Horned King if the pay is good. In Quickstone, House Orien knows the Khaar'paal kobolds that work for them worship the Dark Six and hold revels to the Fury, but they're also really good at placing conductor stones, and that's what matters most. People of conflicting faiths may not trust or like one another, but that doesn't stop them from ever working together.",
										"As is common across Khorvaire, it's important to remember that most priests serving in churches and shrines don't have the powers of a Cleric or Paladin. Many are adepts (divine Magewrights) who can cast Thaumaturgy, Ceremony (from Xanathar's Guide to Everything), and perhaps one other cantrip or ritual\u2014such as Light, Spare the Dying, or Augury. The role of the priest is to offer spiritual guidance to the community, to preach and to organize the local festivals. There are some remarkable priests who do possess greater powers\u2014Vesper in Quickstone, Zerasha in Graywall\u2014but that's not what people expect from their priests. You go to the Jorasco healer if you need someone to heal an injury; you go to a priest of the Sovereign Host when you need someone to lift your spirits. So priests are often influential people within their communities, but they aren't always powerful spellcasters. As a Paladin or a Cleric, you're a champion of your faith granted the power to face challenges a village priest cannot, and they ask you to deal with problems that threaten their community.",

Every major town has a church dedicated to the Sovereign Host, and even some of the villages have churches or small shrines where the faithful can pay their respects. Generally, people worship the pantheon as a whole, offering their prayers and thanks to whichever of the Sovereigns is most relevant to the challenges they're facing at the moment. However, some towns or individuals feel a particular strong connection to a specific sovereign. The town of Shavalant considers Balinor to be its personal patron, while Ardev has a popular shrine devoted to Boldrei. A blacksmith may honor all the Sovereigns in their moment, but still believe that it is Onatar's voice that speaks the loudest.",

Dol Dorn doesn't cause wars, but he will lend his strength to any soldier who trusts in him. It's the smith who forges a blade, vbut Onatar can guide the smith's hand. Some people offer sacrifices to the Sovereigns in moments of great need, but such sacrifices need not have a physical component. A typical sacrifice is a vow\u2014a promise to take some action that honors the Sovereign. This could be a pilgrimage or a prayer, but it can also be more abstract. A scholar struggling with a problem might make a vow to Aureon that if the Sovereign can offer new insight, the sage will finally finish the book they've been putting off\u2014a fitting vow to the Sovereign of knowledge and learning. A warrior who's outnumbered in battle may promise Dol Arrah that if they live through the encounter, they will help the next person they see facing impossible odds in a fight. The primary role of a Vassal priest is to teach people to hear the voices of the Sovereigns within themselves, to realize that the Sovereigns are with them at all times, always ready to lend a hand.",
												"The priesthood of the Sovereign Host isn't as strictly structured as that of the Church of the Silver Flame; many priests are self-taught, especially on the frontier. What matters is your faith and that the people of your community believe in your connection to the Sovereigns. In the village of Cooper Shrine on Silver Lake, the priest Mala Cooper wasn't ordained in a grand temple. But she has tended the shrine since she was a child, and the people of Silver Lake believe that she is blessed. Because of this, priests are dependent on their community to maintain their church, and any Vassal who has unexpected good fortune will usually make a donation.",
												"As noted above, the festivals of the Sovereign Host are important events in the Brelish towns and villages. Often, people in small villages and farms will travel to the nearest town for a celebration, but people can also just celebrate Bounty's Blessing with the largest meal they can produce at their home. The point of a festival is to affirm shared faith and the bonds between a community, and this is something to keep in mind when playing a Vassal character. The Sovereigns speak to you directly, offering you personal guidance. But Boldrei tells you that people are stronger together. Dol Arrah urges you to defend those who cannot defend themselves. In playing a Vassal, keep in mind that it's not just a question of what the Sovereigns can do for you; it's about the connection you have with others through your shared faith. If you find a goblin treasure trove, will you give thanks to Olladra and share this windfall with your local priest? Or do you only turn to the Sovereigns when you need something from them?",

														"The Three Faces are a set of mystery cults hidden within the Five Nations. In addition to the Three Faces of Coin, there are also cults dedicated to the Three Faces of Love, the Three Faces of War, and the Three Faces of the Wild. Each of these cults worship a small combination of members of the Sovereign Host and the Dark Six, who together represent a portfolio. While they are secretive organizations, they're called \"mystery cults\" because they possess secret knowledge that they only share with their initiates. While they are religious organizations, they are also fraternities that unite people who have talents within a certain field\u2014people who, through their success, have shown that they are blessed by one or more of the three faces. So, not every soldier is invited to join the Three Faces of War. If you're tapped by a member of the cult, it's because the initiates recognize through your skills and accomplishments that you are blessed by one of the three\u2014and they believe that you can understand the central mystery, which is that war has more than one face, and that honor, courage, and cunning all have a place on the battlefield. Initiates are bound together by the secret knowledge they possess and their shared understanding of the world, but the Three Faces cults don't have any sort of sinister agenda; it's a bond of fellowship. A Thrane and a Karrn who are both members of the Three Faces of War will fight one another on the battlefield, and two merchants in the Three Faces of Coin will still engage in fierce haggling, because that is what they do; but between these battles, when they share the words of their three, they know that they understand the same mysteries and have a shared understanding of how the world works, and that they have both been deemed to be blessed by the three. So you can certainly have a player character be a member of a Three Faces cult; there's nothing inherently evil about them. Essentially, there's no reason that membership in the Three Faces has to be hidden, aside from the fact that outsiders can't understand the mysteries.",
														"While the Three Faces cults believe that all three of their Sovereigns work together, initiates are chosen because they are perceived to be blessed by one of the three. So the Three Faces of Coin govern the \"battlefield\" of commerce and industry, the struggle to get the things that we desire. Onatar guides those who create the goods people desire, Kol Korran inspires those who trade in the light, and Kol Turrant guides those who work in the shadows. You should always be able to get the things you desire, but you should always pay a fair price for what you receive. All people should have a path to profit, provided they are willing to work for it. These are the tenets of the Three Faces of Coin. An honest blacksmith should always be able to profit from their hard labor, and someone who wishes to purchase the smith's goods should have a way to do so\u2014even if that requires them to work with a \"Pennyroyal,\" someone favored by the Keeper. Coins (the casual term for initiates of the sect) don't inherently oppose trade laws; they simply believe that there should always be a way around them for those prepared to work for it. The honest merchant may never deal with a Pennyroyal, but they know that they could. The information that follows reveals some of the mysteries of the Three Faces of Coin; these aren't absolute secrets, but if you're not part of the cult, you likely don't know these things.",
														"The dark side of the Three Faces of Coin is reflected by their embracing Kol Turrant. The Pyrinean Creed says that the Keeper is the Sovereign of Greed. The Coins understand that in the right time and place, greed can be good\u2014that it is better to understand it and use it than to run from it. Everyone wants things. Everyone who creates wants people to want those things they create. The Coins say that there's nothing wrong with that desire and there's nothing wrong with bending the rules to get what you want, as long as you are willing to pay a fair price. Fair payment is a central pillar of this faith: People deserve to be paid for good work. As such, the Three Faces of Coin are one of the only religious sects that is openly willing to sell the spells of its divine spellcasters. The spell is a commodity; if you want it, you should pay for it. This doesn't mean that as a Coin cleric you HAVE to charge your companions when you cast a spell; but it means that you recognize that your magic has value, that you could charge for it, and that if you are choosing to give this as a gift to a friend, they'd better appreciate it! Those blessed by Kol Turrant\u2014the Pennyroyals\u2014walk a crooked line. The classic Pennyroyal is a smuggler or a fence\u2014someone who dodges the laws in order to get people the things they desire. However, Pennyroyals also include grifters, pickpockets, and thieves. This follows the principle that you should always be able to get the things that you desire\u2014it just skirts the point of paying a fair price (though the thief should be paid a fair price for their services). Ultimately, this comes to the point that it's up to you to decide which of the three paths you will walk. You can choose to only follow the path of Kol Korran and to engage in honest commerce; but as a follower of the Three Faces of Coin, you recognize your comrade's right to step into the shadows when they can't get what they desire in the light.",
														"The holy symbol of the Three Faces of Coin is three coins. When someone is initiated into the sect, they receive three special coins: a copper coin with the dracolich profile of Kol Turrant, a silver coin with a brass dragon for Onatar, and a gold coin with a white dragon profile for Kol Korran. While these coins are treasures, any spread of copper-silver-gold can be used as a signal. This is also the origin of the term Pennyroyal, as the copper coin of the Keeper is sometimes called a penny; \"Penny Royal'' thus means \"Keeper's Chosen.\"",
														"The Three Faces of Coin can be found across Khorvaire and on the frontier, but you likely won't notice them if you aren't an initiate. The exception to this is in the town of Quickstone. A contingent of Coins banded together to help found the town, and they make up a significant portion of the population; as a result, they are a little more open with their faith than usual. However, they still won't share their mysteries with you unless you've been blessed by one of the Three; they just aren't shy about acknowledging their beliefs."

												"Most Brelish settlers follow the Pyrinean Creed of the Sovereign Host, which teaches that the Dark Six are destructive forces that should be shunned, that they encourage greed, madness, and murder. That the Devourer sends the storms that can level your farm and your fields, and that the Shadow creates the monsters that will come for you. With that said, the Brelish are both cynical and pragmatic. There are some who are willing to bargain with the Six if it gets them the things that they desire\u2014whether that's burning a field as a sacrifice to the Devourer so he'll spare the other fields, or shooting a man in the back because they know they can't beat him in a fair fight. They may not be proud of this behavior, but there are those willing to walk the path of the Six to get what they want. This is the basis of the Three Faces cults, who are willing to see both sides\u2014to embrace Dol Arrah and the Mockery, or Kol Korran and the Keeper. Overall, however, the Brelish settlers still shun the Dark Six and curse them when things go wrong. The fact that the Droaamites honor the Six is proof to the Brelish that they're dangerous. Most settlers don't know the difference between Droaamite followers of the Six and the cults of the Horned King, and they don't care; they're all malevolent forces decent people should leave alone.",

														"Droaam is a tapestry of many microcultures. Step back a century and what you'll find is that many of these cultures worshiped various configurations of the Dark Six, but didn't use common names for them or acknowledge the full grouping. The harpies of the Byeshk Mountains worshiped the Song of Rage and Fury, while the Gaa'aram orcs invoked the Bloody Knife; anyone listening to their stories could recognize the shape of the Fury and the Mockery, but the harpies had no knowledge of or interest in the Bloody Knife. This changed because of the efforts of the medusas of Cazhaak Draal, whose missionaries traveled across the Barrens. Few people want to pick a fight with a medusa, so these missionaries were able to share their stories. This had a syncretic aspect, very similar to the way in which the Pyrinean Creed wove the faiths of the Shadow Marches and Talenta Plains into the Sovereign Host; the Cazhaak Missionaries were able to show the harpies that the Song of Rage and Fury was the force they called the Fury, and convince the Gaa'aram that the Bloody Knife was the Mockery.",
														"The most important effects of this missionary work were creating a common language for discussing faith and presenting the idea that these deities that had existed in isolation were part of a unified pantheon. In the present day, the harpies still revere the Fury above all others, but this is the same way that a Vassal blacksmith values their connection with Onatar over the other Sovereigns; they still know that the Fury is part of the greater pantheon, and may invoke other members of the Six when the situation calls for it. The diverse beliefs of Droaam still persist; if you go to the Street of Shadows in Graywall, you'll find a shrine to the First Song and one to the Howl\u2014two different interpretations of the Fury worshiped by different harpy flights. But these traditions are unified by the underlying structure of the Cazhaak faith. Most Droaamites recognize the Shadow as the patron of all monsters, the source of the harpy's voice and the medusa's gaze, and priests of the Shadow are respected by all; the harpy who sings a prayer at the Shrine of the Song will continue on to the Eye of the Shadow to ask the priest Zerasha for guidance.",
														"The general practices of the Dark Six are presented in Exploring Eberron. The primary point is that what the followers of the Sovereign Host see as evil, the followers of the Cazhaak Six see as virtues. The Fury guides the faithful through primal instincts, and grants justice in the form of vengeance. The Mockery shows you the path to victory; what sensible warrior would choose an honorable death over a cunning victory? The Shadow will help you achieve your full potential, even if that means walking paths that others fear. The Cazhaak faith acknowledges that the Sovereigns exist, but it considers them to be weak powers who have somehow tricked their followers. The Vassals say that the Shadow is evil because it creates medusas and harpies; the medusa and the harpy say don't blame us if your gods aren't willing to give you such powers.",

																"The followers of the Cazhaak Six respect the use of cunning and deception in battle. So why then do they call the Sovereign of these forces \"the Mockery?\" The simple answer is that they don't. Keep in mind that the Common tongue is the language of the east; the Droaamites primarily speak Goblin, and they have different words for everything. They understand that the Mockery is the Common translation and the name the easterners will understand, so they are willing to use it when speaking Common. And likewise, we use those names in this book because it's the simplest approach. Adding a new set of Goblin titles for the Six creates an unnecessary layer of complication. It's simpler to just call the Fury \"the Fury'' than to introduce \"Niianu'aram\" as a new name for her. So we refer to the Mockery as the Mockery even when using the Cazhaak interpretation; but that's the common name, and it doesn't reflect how followers of"

Sadly, throughout much of the history of Galifar, the denizens of the Barrens were considered to be supernatural threats, and when templars came to the region it was generally to hunt down \"monsters.\" The Church of the Silver Flame has never had a strong foothold in Breland; the Brelish tend to be cynical and pragmatic, traits that clash with the altruistic optimism of the Silver Flame. In 870 YK, the Church of the Silver Flame established Brightstone Keep in the Barrens as a foothold to watch for lycanthropes and fiends. While initially strongly garrisoned, the keep was stripped of most of its troops and resources when the Last War broke out. Brightstone Keep withstood a host of attacks from Barrens chibs, but it was seized by Droaamite forces in 986 YK, shortly after they claimed Stubborn. The Daughters restored the fortress and installed the gargoyle Cairngorm as warlord of the region, renaming it Grimstone Keep.",
												"In the present day, the only church of the Silver Flame on the Western Frontier is the Bastion in Ardev, overseen by Minister Penti Faldren. There is a shrine in the Tents of Quickstone, and it's possible a survivor of Brightstone Keep is keeping a flame burning on some farm on the border. A handful of missionaries travel across the frontier, seeking to protect the innocent and spread the light; the best known of these is Epitaph, a Dolurrhi tiefling from the sanctuary of Rellekor in Thrane. In general, however, followers of the Silver Flame receive little love on the frontier. True or not, the Droaamites generally think of the followers of the Flame as zealots who wish to destroy all monsters. Brelish settlers are often suspicious, both of the idea that anyone could have entirely altruistic motives and because mebbe they're spies fer Thrane. Epitaph and the other missionaries are working to counter these suspicions with noble acts, and also to learn about the people of Droaam\u2014but there's a long road ahead to win support for the Flame.",
												"If you're playing a character with ties to the Silver Flame, consider whether you have connections to the Church. If you do, you could be an independent missionary, or you could be working on behalf of Minister Faldren of Ardev. On the other hand, you could also be a local who has heard the call of the Silver Flame without having any connection to Flamekeep. This could be especially interesting for a Droaamite character\u2014a harpy who has received visions from the Flame and seeks to protect the innocent, who might not immediately realize they're channeling the same power as the arrogant easterners. A uniquely Droaamite option would be that you might be a potential Voice of the Flame\u2014a Tira Miron for the denizens of Droaam, perhaps empowered to protect your people and stop the Horned King from being released"

														"The denizens of Droaam don't have the same negative reaction to demons as many of the people of the east. The Shadow teaches that you may have to walk dark and dangerous paths to achieve your full potential, and many Cazhaak sages question the 'arbitrary' distinction between celestial and fiend. Because of this, there are many more warlocks than wizards in Droaam\u2014though it's worth noting that a warlock drawing power from an evil entity can use that power for noble purposes. However, such warlocks are often individuals walking their own unique paths.",
														"The most significant and infamous cult in Droaam is that of the Horned King, a demon overlord of the first age who is imprisoned within the region. \"The Horned King\" is the most common translation of the Goblin term Vor'marhu, but some people translate it as \"Horned Prince;\" both titles refer to the overlord Tol Kharash. The Horned King has long been a patron of the minotaur clans of the eastern Barrens, and the warlord Rhesh Turakbar is a champion of this archfiend. This cult is well established in Droaam, and the minotaurs have followed this path for centuries. It's widely known that the Horned King grants power to those who spill blood and sow terror in his name, and while many Droaamites don't like Rhesh Turakbar, most don't see his choice as any different than an eastern paladin who draws divine power from the Silver Flame; both have made a sacrifice that grants them power. The Znir Pact is a notable exception to this. They do understand the difference between a celestial and a fiend, and understand that this isn't just a semantic point. Znir demon-hunters will help those threatened by fiends and even perform exorcisms. But as with all Znir, the hwyri are mercenaries who only act when their services are requested and paid for. It's not the place of the Znir to prevent Turakbar and the minotaurs from making whatever pacts that they wish to; but the hwyri stand ready to bring down the corrupted warriors should the Daughters order it.",
														"The Horned King is the common name of the overlord and the aspect worshiped by Rhesh Turakbar and his clan, the Blood Horns; they raid and pillage in his name. However, each of the major minotaur clans has their own unique interpretation of the Horned King. The Red Hooves are devoted to He Who Walks Behind, and prefer sly ambushes to the howling assaults of the Blood Horns. The Blade Breaker clan worships One Horn, who rewards displays of strength and courage. While the Blade Breakers are just as aggressive as the Blood Horns, they are less brutal; it's just possible that while they think One Horn is an aspect of the Horned King, they are in truth drawing on a different power\u2014perhaps, the essence of Dol Dorn. If you wish to play a character tied to the Horned King or another overlord, the main question is whether you see your overlord as an ally dealing fairly with you\u2014granting you power for spilling blood in their name\u2014or if you have actually broken your ties with your cult and now use that power against them."

There are no known widespread cults of the Dragon Below on the frontier, and the Daughters of Sora Kell would likely destroy any they discovered.

Some scholars believe that it was the influence of Avassh\u2014the Twister of Roots\u2014that forced the ancient nations to devastate the Barrens and create the regions known as dead lands.

Over four hundred people live in the shantytown known as the Tents; some of these people are just waiting for their permanent residences to be built, while others are dwelling in squalor while hoping to find a path to fortune. The vast majority of the people are Brelish, with the typically diverse Brelish makeup; slightly less than half of these residents are humans, while the rest are a mix that includes gnomes, halflings, dwarves, elves, half-elves, and goblins. Though other species are rare\u2014there's only a handful of shifters in town, and currently no resident tieflings\u2014the people of Quickstone are used to just about anything. In 997 YK a clan of kobolds moved into the Tents, and while there are some who shun the kobolds\u2014notably Brelish veterans who fought on the western front during the war\u2014today kobold musicians perform at the Crown inn and the Rose Theater, and Littlehand Haberdashers have adopted certain popular kobold fashions.",

												"Quickstone is an unusual substance that can be encountered in three forms. Soft quickstone is a soft, red material similar in consistency to sandstone, though surprisingly lightweight. Wet quickstone, often called the quick by miners, is a blood-red material with the consistency of soft clay; this form maintains its fluid consistency even when exposed to heat. Fixed quickstone is rust-brown in color, like dried blood, and is considerably harder than granite. In the mountains, quickstone can be found in its wet or soft forms. What makes quickstone remarkable is how it responds to arcane energy. Using arcane rituals, it's possible to shift quickstone back and forth between its wet and soft forms. Another ritual transforms it into fixed quickstone\u2014though once it is fixed, it can't be changed again. Many of the buildings in Quickstone have been sculpted from quickstone, but as they are fixed they can't be remolded. The sculpted houses of Quickstone look as if they were molded from clay, though the fixed quickstone is far more durable than clay, or even wood.",
												"To date, quickstone has only been found in the Graywall Mountains. Its origin is a mystery; it's too widespread to be the result of a manifest zone. The ancient Dhakaani goblins of the region used quickstone in their structures, and it was the dar who first established the quarries above Quickstone. Some might wonder how it is that the quarries weren't mined out long ago; it's almost as if the quickstone grew back over the course of thousands of years.",
												"The quarries and the town have plenty of work for miners and masons with strong arms, people who can excavate the stone and move it where it needs to go. But there's also a specialized form of magewright that's a vital part of this process. Stone chanters learn and perform rituals that allow them to shift quickstone between its three forms. They can also use a specialized form of the Mold Earth cantrip (from Xanathar's Guide to Everything) that they use to shape wet quickstone when building large structures. Quickstone isn't the only town that has stone chanters or quickstone\u2014there are other, older mining towns further south along the Graywall Mountains\u2014but it's still a specialized tradition that's only just now becoming common knowledge further east as quickstone is being exported. In theory, anyone could learn to perform the stone chanter rituals with enough time and practice, but certain people in Quickstone seem to have a knack for it; these chanters say they can hear the stone whispering to them. In Quickstone, about one in ten miners is a stone chanter.",
												"While quarrying quickstone is the primary industry in Quickstone, there is a second rare resource in the Graywall Mountains: the purplish metal known as byeshk. The people of the Five Nations have little experience with byeshk, and are still discovering its properties and value. There is a network of old byeshk mines in and below the mountains south of Quickstone, but unlike quickstone, byeshk doesn't grow back. Beyond that, these upper mines are largely played out, as well as being infested with cockatrices and other dangerous creatures. However, Quickstone resident Honoria Soldorak has bought these mines from Count ir'Blis and wants to have them fully explored. If significant byeshk deposits remain, they could be of great interest to both Soldorak and House Cannith. See the \"Byeshk Weapons\" sidebar in chapter 5 for more information about byeshk."

												"House Orien connected Quickstone to the lightning rail network in 997 YK, extending the line from Ardev. This is a boon for the town, dramatically increasing commerce with the east and increasing the ability to ship quickstone. It also means that Quickstone is a stepping stone for people taking the rail from the east to get to Droaam, or anyone traveling from Droaam to the cities of the east. At the moment, the train only runs two days a week, which means that people traveling east may have to wait a few days. As a result, Quickstone sees a steady stream of interesting travelers; merchants and diplomats from the east who have dealings with Droaam and its warlords, but also mercenaries or immigrants from Droaam who are heading east. It's always an interesting evening when a troop of Znir gnolls passes through town!",
												"While House Orien is still negotiating with warlords and the Daughters of Sora Kell, it has already begun work extending the line toward Droaam. To assist with this work, the house has employed the Khaar'paal, a clan of Graywall kobolds who've settled in the shantytown known as the Tents. These kobolds have a natural affinity for working with lightning, as well as a resistance to electrical damage; thanks to these traits, they are able to excel at this work, and Orien's made it worth their while to relocate to Quickstone. The Khaar'paal are discussed later in this chapter, but they are largely employed by Orien to work on the ongoing westward expansion."

Within the major cities of the Five Nations, members of this cult tend to be secretive, but adherents of this faith\u2014generally referred to as \"Coins\"\u2014played an important role in establishing the town of Quickstone. Some were honest merchants who saw opportunity on the frontier and wished to practice their faith more openly. Others were smugglers, who realized that settling on the border between Breland and Droaam would let them profit from both.",
												"In Quickstone, \"smuggler\" has three meanings: someone who deals in materials that are illegal under Brelish law; someone who deals in legal goods, but who avoids the King's Assessors and Droaam's informal \"tax collectors\"; or someone who deals in goods that are rare and dangerous to acquire and can't be purchased through normal markets. Most of the smugglers in Quickstone fall into two or more of these categories; the point is that there are \"smugglers'' whose goods aren't actually illegal\u2014they're just unusual. Now that the count has official representatives in town, as well as the dragonmarked houses, the business of smuggling has shifted somewhat. But Quickstone largely exists because of smugglers, and especially in Oldtown there are a great many people devoted to the Three Faces of Coin and who still believe that people should always be able to get the things that they desire."

The people of the town and the region have a variety of stories that explain these ruins. The most popular one is that the Quickstone fortress was built by Breggor Firstking, founder of Wroat\u2014the pre-Galifar nation that preceded Breland. A more fanciful tale suggests that this fortress was built by the Sovereigns in the days when they walked the world and fought demons; this is especially popular with the patrons of the tavern known as Dorn's Rest. History checks or divination magic will confirm that the fortress was in fact a relic of the goblinoid Empire of Dhakaan; the brutalist style of architecture is distinctive, as is the design of the aqueducts. However, many locals refuse to accept these facts; after all, if the goblins could build something like this, why aren't they building them today?",
												"Regardless of this, the region is filled with relics of the Empire of Dhakaan and the conflict that destroyed it. The quickstone quarry in the foothills was established by the Dhakaani, as were the mines that stretch down below the mountains. While exploring, you might find a fragment of a shattered statue or stumble across evidence of a long-forgotten battle. It's up to you to decide how your character responds to these things. Are you an avid student of history, always keen to learn more about the ancient empire of Dhakaan?

												"Quickstone is a Brelish town established by Brelish settlers, and there are more humans than any other species among the inhabitants. But just as there's a steady stream of merchants and envoys traveling west to do business in Droaam, nearly every day there are some travelers coming from Droaam. Many of these are mercenaries working with House Tharashk, and these bands often have a Tharashk liaison to help them adapt to Brelish customs. Others are immigrants seeking opportunity in the Five Nations, or citizens of Droaam with business in the east. So, while there's only a handful of so-called monsters who reside in Quickstone, there's nothing unusual about seeing an ogre wandering down the street or a squad of gnolls sharpening their weapons while they wait for the lightning rail to arrive. There are certainly people in Quickstone who are afraid of these creatures, and many of the Brelish veterans\u2014who fought such monsters on the western front\u2014actively despise them. But any creature found in Droaam could be found in Quickstone, and even those who don't like them will generally just avoid them. As a general rule, the people of Oldtown have a very casual attitude toward \"monsters\"; Tuuva Mercantile is run by a family of goblins and the bouncer at the Crown is a troll. The people of Main Street have typically spent less time on the frontier and may be a little more uncomfortable dealing with harpies or medusas, but they won't refuse to do business with them."

The southern edge of town abuts a cliff face, with a path leading up to the quickstone quarries that are Quickstone's primary industry. The town is built on the site of an ancient fortress, which fell long before the rise of Galifar. The primary remnant of this is the western wall\u2014a section of quickstone wall, approximately forty feet high and ten feet thick, that merges directly into the cliff face to the south. The first settlers used the cliff and the wall as the foundations for their quickstone homes, and were able to restore the ancient underground aqueducts that supply the town with water. As new waves of settlers have come to Quickstone, the town has been expanding to the north. This has resulted in the old town in the south being largely simple, sculpted quickstone, while the dragonmarked outposts and the newer homes in the region known as Main Street are designed to appeal to the sensibilities of travelers and tourists.",
										"Quickstone is expanding as quickly as it can. Demand for new homes currently outstrips the pace of production; there are hundreds of people living in the shantytown known as the Tents. It's a small town; the entire population of Quickstone barely matches that of a single district in Sharn. Small as it is, it's broken into a number of sections that are distinct both geographically and culturally.

This area is known as Oldtown, and is distinguished by both the quickstone buildings and the fact that many of its residents have been in Quickstone since the beginning. Oldtown is thus home to a blend of hard-working miners, scoundrels and smugglers, and merchants who now fear that the dragonmarked houses may move in and drive them out of business. The newest residents of Oldtown are mostly Cyran refugees. Oldtown is continuing to expand to the west, but new dwellings are small, stacked quickstone structures\u2014so it's cheap housing for people who can't afford to live on Main Street.",

Initially, the count had little interest in Quickstone and allowed the settlers considerable free rein. This changed with the end of the Last War. With Droaam growing in strength and the dragonmarked houses taking an interest in the region, ir'Blis decided he needed a more direct hand in the region. The count ordered the construction of the Town Hall, and appointed a magistrate to serve as his voice as well as a sheriff to enforce the law. While the count has invested in the town infrastructure and helped Quickstone expand, many of the townsfolk have no great love for the magistrate or the sheriff.",
												"Both Magistrate Facet and Sheriff Constable are warforged who served Count ir'Blis during the war. They are utterly loyal to the count and have thus far proved incorruptible. However, they are only two people, supported by a handful of clerks and deputies. If the people of Quickstone were to actively rebel against them, it would have terrible consequences. The simple fact is that these two warforged don't have the resources to end smuggling in Quickstone, or to deal with every brawl in the Crown or knife-fight in the Tents. The sheriff typically won't even engage a known brigand unless they commit a crime in Quickstone. For the law to take action, a crime generally has to either upset the people of Quickstone or be perceived as a threat to the count's authority. The sheriff may not engage a brigand without provocation, but he also won't trouble the adventurer who kills that brigand in a duel; on the other hand, if that same adventurer kills the owner of Tuuva Mercantile, there will be an immediate outcry and the killer will be pursued and prosecuted. A general side effect of this is that crimes against travelers or refugees are far less likely to be prosecuted than crimes against residents. The Pennyroyals specifically target travelers; someone who robs Kemble Bank had best leave town immediately, but a pickpocket who only targets people passing through can likely get away with it, unless their victim is someone with so much influence that the crime will come to the attention of Count ir'Blis.",
												"In essence, Quickstone is governed by frontier justice. The resources of the law are limited, and if the people of Quickstone support a crime (or at least aren't offended by it), the sheriff isn't likely to pursue it unless it's something that the count himself would take notice of. Likewise, the King's Assessors and the sheriff will target smugglers that are going too far\u2014being too obvious, getting too greedy, transporting something that simply can't be overlooked\u2014but they don't try to stop every single smuggler.

The Magistrate prefers numbers to people, and spends most of their time writing and analyzing reports. While they carry the authority of the count, they rarely exert this power unless called on to do so by the Town Council; primarily they concern themselves with the proper allocation of royal funds and ensuring that taxes are collected (and are at least marginally accurate). The Magistrate is supported by a handful of clerks and servants who maintain the town hall. They also hold authority over the King's Assessors, a minor and unloved branch of the Dark Lanterns that investigates smuggling and assesses taxes. At the moment, the Magistrate only has a single assessor in his service, a Khoravar named Tam Underbridge; Tam's partner suffered a fatal accident a month ago. The King's Assessors are sometimes called \"Canaries,\" as their deaths are often an early sign of trouble...",
														"Sheriff Constable enforces the law. A warforged juggernaut, his utter adherence to military regulations caused his comrades to name him \"Constable,\" and he chose to embrace that name. So, he's the sheriff, Constable. He's disgusted by the greed and pettiness he sees in the common citizenry, but he knows that he lacks the resources to pursue every criminal and has adapted to the realities of his position. Nonetheless, anyone foolish enough to break the laws of Breland in his presence should expect swift justice; he may overlook deals made in the shadows, but he will not let a crime he observes go unpunished. He is very protective of the Magistrate, who at the moment is his only real friend.",
														"The sheriff has four deputies, who are generally kept busy just maintaining the town hall and watching the streets. Constable has the authority to deputize anyone as needed in the pursuit of his duties. This could result in him turning to the player characters if they earn his trust; otherwise, he'll generally turn to the Grizzlies, as these veterans are mostly loyal to ir'Blis.",
														"The Town Council is an elected council that currently has six members, each representing one of the factions in Quickstone. According to the town charter, councilors serve three-year terms, with two councilors coming up for election each year (on 9 Rhaan, Boldrei's Feast); in practice, there's only been two elections since the system was put into place. The primary role of the council is to make requests of the sheriff and the Magistrate. They can request the use of royal funds, demand that the sheriff investigate a particular crime, or address other civic concerns. The current councilors are Astan Morn (The Mourners), Gareth Stone (the Chanters), Jessa Grain (The Grizzlies), Rhia d'Orien (House Orien), Vesper (the Church), and Zel Tuuva (Tuuva Mercantile). While it's quite unusual for a dragonmarked heir to hold such a position, the people of Main Street support Rhia and the Magistrate allowed it. All that it takes to be a councilor is the support of a significant number of people and the desire to do the job. This is certainly a position an adventurer could hold, and if you think your character might already be a member of the town council at the start of a campaign, discuss it with your DM, and they might have you replace one of the current councilors.",

														"So what's considered a crime in Quickstone, and what are the consequences of bad behavior? In general, Quickstone adheres to the Code of Galifar. Theft, assault, fraud, and murder are all crimes, and they are crimes, whether carried out with weapons or magic; in the eyes of the law, there's no difference between using Suggestion to trick someone into giving you their valuables and using the threat of violence to accomplish the same thing. However, as called out above, the primary question is whether anyone is going to actually report the crime, and if they do, whether the sheriff will take up the case. In the case of the person who's been charmed out of their goods, are they going to report it, or will they be too embarrassed to do so? Was the victim someone who's important to the town, or were they an annoying merchant passing through, who most people feel got what was coming to them? Sheriff Constable has limited resources and his primary concern is maintaining order. If a bad hand of Thrones results in a brawl in which no one is seriously hurt, no one is going to bring down the law. Most anything that happens in the Tents is going to be ignored. On the other hand, if someone were to brazenly rob Kemble Bank or steal from Bel at the Anvil, they shouldn't expect to just remain in Quickstone without consequences.",
														"If you commit a crime in Quickstone, the first concern is witnesses. Are there people who see what's going on? If so, do they care? Again, when there's a random bar brawl, many people are more likely to join in than to call for the law. But if someone spots you using Suggestion to cheat Bel, do they realize what's going on? Do they want to help Bel? Most people in Quickstone won't actually directly intervene, but they'll raise the \"hue and cry\"\u2014calling out for help and describing the crime. The goal is to call a crowd and bring in witnesses. Hopefully, this is enough to cause you to rethink your actions; if not, even if the crowd doesn't want to engage you, they may try to block your escape until someone arrives who will take action. That should be Sheriff Constable or his deputies, who will usually first call on you to surrender and then try to bring you down by force; they'll try to take you alive, but if you resist arrest, they won't try too hard. If Constable isn't around, it's possible that a vigilante will step up to intervene. Grim, the bouncer at the Crown, has brought down criminals before when called out by the hue and cry; the veterans known as the Grizzlies might also step in when the law is unavailable.",
														"There are two cells in the Town Hall, but these are mainly used for unruly drunks or to hold people until judgment; long-term incarceration isn't an option. In a clear-cut case, Sheriff Constable can simply impose a penalty immediately; if things are more complicated, the criminals will be brought before the Magistrate, who will call for testimony within a Zone of Truth (which they can cast) and render a judgment on behalf of Count ir'Blis. The simplest punishment is humiliation: offenders may be placed in stocks in the Square for a period of time, forced to make a public confession and apology, or carry out some form of public service. Fines are the next most common punishment, sometimes defaulting to indentured servitude if the offender can't pay. For serious crimes or repeated offenses, execution is always on the table. Another option is to be (literally) branded an outlaw; as an outlaw you are no longer a Brelish citizen (if you ever were) and not entitled to the protections of the Code of Galifar. It's worth noting that a crime is only a crime if it's committed against someone protected by the law, which outlaws and the denizens of Droaam are not! Robbing a visiting medusa may not be the smartest thing you could do, and could make you powerful enemies if it interferes with, say, her delicate negotiations with House Orien; but it's technically not a crime under the laws of Breland.",
														"With all that in mind, vigilante justice is alive and well on the Western Frontier. Even if Sheriff Constable and the Magistrate aren't involved or choose not to pursue a crime, other power groups in town may take action on their own. The criminal elements within the Coins have a strict code\u2014notably, not targeting residents with crimes\u2014and may take direct action against lone wolves or even other Coins who break these rules. The veteran militia known as the Grizzlies may also take the law into their own hands\u2014especially if Mourners or natives of Droaam are causing trouble."

														"Dueling is a sound example of something that is illegal under Brelish law, but that's an established tradition on the frontier. If you walk into the Crown and shoot someone in the back, people are going to report it to the sheriff. But if you boldly call out your enemy, proclaiming your justified grievances for all to hear\u2014and assuming your grievances are justified\u2014it's likely the crowd will support you and call for a duel. Dueling is illegal, and if Sheriff Constable is present when you issue a challenge, he will be obligated to intervene. But there's been at least one instance when the sheriff was seen walking toward a duel in progress and then suddenly stopped to study a fascinating stone he'd stepped on, keeping his head down just long enough to miss an incident. Of course, this is a double-ended wand: if you have justification, you can call someone out for a duel... but likewise, if you wrong someone, they can call YOU out. Anyone who refuses a duel that the crowd considers justified will draw a lot of hostility and may be refused service, be insulted, or worse; if you're just going to ignore a challenge, you might want to leave town for a while."

Vesper, the local priest of the Sovereign Host, has been working on this, and her initial idea is sand fruit. It's something exotic that people don't have in the east. The only problem is that when it comes down to it, sand fruit is terrible. It's remarkable for its ability to thrive in the harsh environment, but even in Quickstone most people would rather have an orange or an apple instead of sand fruit. Vesper is determined to overcome this handicap, and is encouraging the townsfolk to come up with exciting ways to celebrate sand fruit.",

Whatever happens, Vesper will always encourage people to pursue any path that could interest people in sand fruit and the festival. Keep in mind that part of Vesper's interest in this is profit.

										"The Three Faces of Coin is a Sovereign mystery cult that exists in the shadows of the Five Nations. Members believe they are blessed by the Sovereigns of commerce and that the Sovereigns will guide them to profit; they also believe in the opportunity to work around the laws that restrict trade. Ten years ago, the smuggler Brogan Hul approached the priest Vesper and convinced her to rally her congregation to take a chance on an opportunity on the Western Frontier. Along with the Chanters, these people were the founders of Quickstone and built what's now known as Oldtown. In the east they concealed their faith, but here\u2014in a town where they make up nearly half the population and run many of the important businesses\u2014they're willing to be identified as the Coins.",
										"The majority of the Coins are honest merchants, artisans, and farmers\u2014people who create products, or who make their living by buying and selling. The others are largely smugglers, with a blend of grifters and other scoundrels... A group known in town as the Pennyroyals. All of these people stand together as neighbors, believing that it is their work together that will bring prosperity to Quickstone. With that said, they came to the frontier so the honest merchants wouldn't have to compete with the dragonmarked houses and the smugglers wouldn't be under the eyes of the law... And now ir'Blis has appointed his magistrate and sheriff, and Dragonmarked businesses are setting up on Main Street. The Pennyroyals have had to limit their activities while they come to terms with the presence of the sheriff, and the other Coins are doing their best; the Crown may not be as clean as the Gold Dragon Inn, but for now it's still profitable. But the Coins are uneasy; the town is changing, and many fear that the opportunities that brought them to the frontier are slipping away.",
										"While humans make up the majority of the Coins, they are diverse and include a significant number of Khoravar, gnomes, and goblins (including the Tuuva Clan). Vesper maintains the Church and serves all Vassals, but she is specifically the spiritual leader of the Coins and the people are devoted to her. Brogan Hul set aside smuggling to run the Crown inn, but he is a respected leader of the community and coordinates the actions of the Pennyroyals. While he's not blatant about these dealings, he also doesn't go out of his way to hide them; any resident with an ear to the ground knows that Brogan is the person to talk to if you need something that's not entirely covered by the law.",
										"The Coins aren't some sort of sinister conspiracy. But they are a community united by faith and shared history, and they laid the foundations of Quickstone.

Any character could be a Coin, but the Coins came to the frontier in pursuit of prosperity:",

										"The Grizzlies are Brelish veterans who served under Count ir'Blis during the Last War. In recognition of exceptional service, he granted fifty veterans and their families small tracts of land in the vicinity of Quickstone. Some have already taken up residence on their land, while a few others have settled in the Square. However, most remain in the Tents while they wait for their final housing to be completed.",
										"When the veterans arrived in Quickstone, former lieutenant Jovi Olan set up a camp in the Tents. This camp is governed by strict military discipline; while they are no longer soldiers, the veterans who follow Olan live as if they still were, wearing their armor and maintaining their camp as if on duty. When others took to calling them the Grizzlies\u2014a play on the Brelish bear on their uniforms and their grizzled appearance\u2014they adopted it with pride. While there is little call for their military services, they essentially function as a tiny town within the town. Their hunters bring in food that's prepared by the camp. They've got their own artisans who maintain their equipment, a medic who tends the injured, and the quartermaster, Hessia Goldleaf, works to acquire other necessary supplies. Generally, the Grizzlies are supported by the Brelish veterans who live outside the Tents, but there are a few veterans who want nothing to do with Olan and the Grizzlies, saying it's time to break their swords and to leave the war behind.",
										"The Grizzlies are a functioning militia. They regularly declare their loyalty to Count ir'Blis and Breland, saying that they stand ready to protect Quickstone from any threats from Droaam \"or elsewhere.\" A few Grizzlies serve Sheriff Constable as deputies, and the rest are generally prepared to join a posse whenever there is trouble. However, the Grizzlies have also been known to carry out vigilante justice, specifically within the Tents and often relating to troubles caused by Mourners, kobolds, or Droaamite immigrants. The Grizzlies maintain that they are just helping to maintain order in a chaotic environment and that the people they target are criminals. But many of the Grizzlies who served on the western front don't believe Droaamites can be trusted, and a significant number think that as Cyre fought Breland during the war, there's no reason for the count to be treating the Mourners like friends today. If your character is a Grizzly, you'll have to decide if you share these suspicions and prejudices, or if you seek to maintain the peace and keep your comrades from causing too much trouble.",
										"The Grizzlies are all former Brelish soldiers, with the same mix of species found across Breland. Jovi Olan is the highest ranking former officer, and it's largely his charisma that holds the Grizzlies together. Former sergeant Jessa Grain holds a seat on the town council and represents the interests of the Grizzlies, including advocating for stronger defenses and limiting handouts to the Mourners. Hessia Goldleaf is an expert at finding what the Grizzlies need and is always watching for a bargain or an opportunity. And the warforged Smith is in charge of the artisans. Smith yearns to prove that his talents at the forge are superior to those of Bel, the Cyran blacksmith who runs the Anvil; Bel has no interest in this rivalry and often forgets who Smith is.",

										"The Khaar'paal are a group of about sixty kobolds camped on the southern edge of the Tents. They don't work metal; their tents are made of leather, their tools of wood and stone. At a glance, most assume these kobolds are a primitive nomadic tribe; this assumption is wrong on every count. Khaar'paal means mageblood, and the Khaar'paal kobolds have an innate talent for arcane magic, not unlike that of a sorcerer. They may not use metal, but they have talented magewrights who make use of Mending, Prestidigitation, Magecraft, Continual Flame and similar magical techniques and tools, and work with exotic materials like quickstone and wyvern hide. Their wands may not be as well- tooled as those produced by House Cannith, but the Khaar'paal scouts are wandslingers and are as capable as any Brelish arcane dragoon.",
										"The first common mistake is to assume the Khaar'paal are primitive; the second is to think they're nomads. The Khaar'paal have a subterranean town in the Graywall Mountains that is considerably larger than Quickstone, and the kobolds think that Quickstone is something of an eyesore. The Khaar'paal in the Tents aren't a tribe, and they didn't bring their children or families; they're a workforce, hired by House Orien to support the western expansion of the lightning rail. Between their skill at working with stone and their natural affinity for elemental energies, the Khaar'paal have a remarkable talent for the work required to prepare and place conductor stones. Orien has used Khaar'paal artisans as specialists on other rail lines, and given the proximity to their home, this time Orien hired a larger force of them. Some assume that the kobolds are cheap or expendable laborers; little could be further from the truth. The Khaar'paal are paid more than the typical stonelayer, and they're worth every coin.",
										"Like the Grizzlies, the Khaar'paal camp is largely self-sufficient; they came prepared with hunters and the artisans needed to care for their own. The priest, Sarvus'kor, is a servant of the Fury; while she can't heal the sick with magic, she's a capable herbalist who works with mundane medicine. Skaivus is a \"spell- crafter,\" who follows the Khaar'paal tradition of artifice; he's capable of producing common magic items, and more if he acquires exotic components. Vanon'dor is the overseer, a specialist in working with the conductor stones and a deadly wandslinger who stands ready to protect his people. Together, Sarvus'kor and Vanon'dor lead the camp: Sarvus'kor is the spiritual guide (devoted to the Cazhaak Six), while Vanon'dor directs the workforce and maintains discipline.",
										"While the Khaar'paal weren't involved in the fighting on the western front, many of the townsfolk were initially uncomfortable with this force of Droaamites on their doorstep. Today, the Khaar'paal workers remain largely isolated, but the communities are slowly growing closer; kobold scouts display their acrobatic prowess at the Rose Theater, and Khaar'paal occasionally play traditional music (involving drums and the sar'duur, a unique form of nose flute) at the Crown. A few of the townspeople now join in the Aram'ja revels at the Khaar'paal camp. Nonetheless, there are still many\u2014especially among the Grizzlies\u2014who distrust the kobolds.",
										"If your character is a kobold, you could be one of the Khaar'paal. If you're proficient with Arcana or Mason's Tools, you could have come to Quickstone to work on the lightning rail. Otherwise, you might be a scout, a hunter, or otherwise supporting the community as your skills suggest. If you're a kobold but not one of the Khaar'paal, consider whether you know of the Khaar'paal or wish to join them... Or if you and your kin have a rivalry with the mageblood clan!",

										"In the wake of the Mourning, thousands of Cyrans were left without a homeland. King Boranel of Breland was sympathetic to their plight; he allowed a host of refugees to cross into Breland, and called together his nobles to see where the Cyrans could be placed. Count Thauvius ir'Blis offered to settle a few hundred Cyrans in the growing town of Quickstone. This may have been an entirely altruistic move, placing the refugees in a town that seemed to be on the rise; however, some wonder if ir'Blis wasn't just as interested in placing more warm bodies between Droaam and his richer lands. In either case, early in 996 YK, over two hundred refugees arrived in Quickstone. The shantytown to the west of town was expanded to serve as a refugee camp, and today these Cyrans make up the majority of the population of the Tents. Initially, others called them \"Mourners'' as a pejorative term, mocking their lost homeland. Over time, this term has come into common use even by those who bear the Cyrans no ill will.",
										"The Mourners have always faced challenges, even within their own community. They're all from Cyre, but they're hardly a monolithic group. Some came from great cities, others were farmers, and some were soldiers who were serving on the Brelish front\u2014something that doesn't exactly make them popular with the Brelish citizens of Quickstone. Some of the Mourners were once powerful and wealthy; having lost everything in the Mourning, they must learn to fend for themselves, and they aren't all good at it. Some of the most capable among them\u2014such as the smith Bel Thiel and the Cannith tinker Jury\u2014use their talents to help other Mourners, but there are others who are only looking out for themselves, even if personal success comes at the expense of their fellow Cyrans. Astan Morn\u2014the headman of the Cyran village of Ashford\u2014has become the de facto leader of the community, and established a stable camp within the tents jokingly called \"the Vermishard\" after the great palaces of Metrol. In the Vermishard, Morn works with those Cyrans most committed to helping their kin. They ration the supplies they receive from the Magistrate and spread out what they raise through their own efforts. Yenna Lane is a magewright healer who does what she can for her people; while she is capable of casting Lesser Restoration, she rarely has the components required for the ritual and can only provide mundane care. Elin Ton is a former acolyte of the Silver Flame who maintains a shrine in the Vermishard and is the closest thing the Mourners have to a priest. He cannot perform divine magic, but he does his best to maintain morale and offer guidance\u2014though the majority of the Mourners are Vassals and prefer the council of Vesper in town, or simply keep their own counsel. Astan, Yenna, and Elin are the most prominent figures within the Vermishard, and Astana also currently holds a seat on the town council; the other well-known Mourners are Bel Thiel and Jury d'Cannith. When the town's former smith was killed in a raid, Jury d'Cannith arranged for herself and Bel to take over, establishing the Anvil smithy. Both are talented and generous, and their good work has helped to improve general relations between the townsfolk and the Mourners.",
										"While things are improving for the Mourners, they've never been good. The simple fact is that four years ago, Cyre and Breland were at war. Many of the Grizzlies question why any aid is being given to these former enemies of the nation, and there are often quarrels and brawls between Grizzlies and Mourners. Even beyond the Grizzlies, given the choice between giving an opportunity to a Mourner or to a Chanter, Coin, or Grizzly, most will choose the Brelish. Count ir'Blis has pledged to help the Mourners, and has provided basic supplies (tents, blankets, tools); the Magistrate provides regular deliveries of food and other supplies to the Vermishard camp. The count wishes to give land and housing to the Cyrans, and they have been granted a small stretch of farmland. But ir'Blis says that he is bound to honor his duties to his former veterans\u2014the Grizzlies\u2014first and foremost, and available housing and the best land has been going to them. Those who are capable among the Mourners contribute by hunting, working in the mines, and doing their best to practice their trades. Bel and Jury channel the bulk of the profits from the Anvil to the Vermishard, and this has allowed some families to move into tenements in Oldtown. But for now, life is hard for the Mourners\u2014made harder by the ongoing tensions with the Grizzlies and other Brelish, but also by the divisions among the refugees themselves",

Most are Vassals of the Sovereign Host, and many are devoted to the Three Faces of Coin\u2014so there's overlap between the Coins and the Tuuva Clan, but not all the goblins are Coins.

Because Quickstone is so small, life revolves around specific businesses rather than around neighborhoods. You don't just go down to Lower Dura or Upper Central; you go to the Crown. If you want to get new armor, you go see Bel and Jury at the Anvil. This isn't a complete list of every shop in Quickstone, new places are always opening, and existing businesses may close. But these are the pillars of Quickstone, and the people who own them and run them are important members of the town's close-knit community.",

Each business includes a few possible hooks that could tie a character to that place. Pick one or two of these and work with the DM to establish the details. Alternatively, if you have a character who's similar to one of these key NPCs, you and your DM could decide to have your character replace the NPC. So, if you're a skilled blacksmith, you could be an independent rival of Bel Thiel at the Anvil; but another option is for YOU to be the town's blacksmith, removing Bel from the scenario.",

But if you're willing to pay for quality, you want to see Bel. The Anvil is the largest and best equipped smithy in Quickstone, and the only one that pledges to meet Cannith standards. The Anvil produces weapons, armor, and tools; Bel also works on larger scale projects. Arcane artisan Jury d'Cannith is always working on something new, and the Anvil usually has an assortment of common or uncommon magic items; given time and the proper supplies (assuming they can be found), Jury can easily do custom work.",

Born into a family of guild smiths in the Cyran city of Eston, Bel served Cyre as an engineer during the Last War. In the wake of the Mourning, she rallied a group of refugees and helped them survive the journey that ultimately brought them to Quickstone. Today, Bel and Jury donate the bulk of their profits to the Mourner community. While Bel has no interest in being a leader, she has a lot of influence with the Mourners.",

Jury is a talented arcane artisan, but her independent nature kept her from finding a place within the Cannith hierarchy. She's always happiest when she's working on something new\u2014especially if it's never been done before. She's from the Juran family of House Cannith, and this is the origin of her name; she's never revealed her true name.",

It's not as clean as the Gold Dragon Inn, the paint needs to be refreshed, and some nights it seems like more people leave through the windows than the door. But for the customers, the entertainment and opportunities more than make up for the mess. There's an axe-throwing wall on the east side of the common room; some nights, the elf Tyraen will conjure images on the wall, creating elaborate scenarios for the competitors to face. There's always a variety of games at the tables, for stakes as high as anyone's willing to play for. Beyond that, this is the primary place to find members of the Pennyroyals\u2014smugglers, fences, and others whose business lies beyond the strict confines of the law\u2014who pay a tithe to the innkeeper Brogan in exchange for his help arranging deals.

The magewright entertainer Tyraen plays the Thurimbar Rod and provides illusory entertainments most nights, but the small stage is always open for other local acts; the Greensinger Briar often leads people in song, and a kobold nose-flutist named Hetch is gaining popularity. A number of minor social clubs meet at the Crown on a weekly basis\u2014the Rockhounds, the Soldier's Choir, the Wizard's Circle, and more. With that being said, it's a dangerous place for outsiders. It's not that it's physically dangerous; there are regular brawls, but the bouncer Grim will intervene if things get bloody. The simplest way to look at it is that this is an inn for wolves. The pack looks after its own, but careless sheep who walk through the door are likely to get fleeced.",

However, the innkeeper, Brogan, takes care of his regulars, stocking a wide range of exotic spirits and foods\u2014slightly toxic Mror mushroom wine, unusual Droaamite delicacies for regular guests from the west, and other special requests. If he takes a liking to you, he can pull strings to get ahold of your personal favorites, producing special meals of up to Wealthy quality. Most rooms are Modest in quality and price, but there are three Comfortable rooms, and Brogan can find Poor accommodations for friends in need. The inn takes its name from its \"crown brew,\" a horrifying rotgut that only costs 1 Copper Crown for a mug; the taste is terrible, but it serves its purpose.",

The chef, Fylas, generally produces modest cuisine, but he loves an interesting challenge. The most unusual member of the staff is the bouncer, a war troll known only as Grim. No one knows the exact nature of her relationship with Brogan; some say that he won her services in a hand of Thrones, while others say that the innkeeper struck a bargain with a disguised Sora Maenya\u2014and Grim was assigned to keep him alive until he fulfills this bargain.

It's no secret that Honoria is unhappy about the imminent arrival of House Kundarak; she's enjoyed her role as the richest woman in Quickstone, and once the enclave is fully operational she's likely to be eclipsed by Kundarak. However, she still has a card left to play; Honoria Soldorak has purchased the old mines adjacent to Quickstone from ir'Blis. This is an uncertain investment as currently the mines are unusable, infested with cockatrices and other threats. Because of this, there's no actual way of knowing what they hold.

Yenna Lane is a healer who takes care of the Mourners, but she'll sell her services to those who can't afford Jorasco prices at the Patchery. It's also the case that many of the most notable artisans in town are magewrights, even if it's not mentioned. Bel Thiel uses Magecraft (from Exploring Eberron) and Mending to help with her smithcraft. Noon Tuuva uses Prestidigitation and Magecraft in his baking. The Magewrights in Quickstone table provides a few specific examples of magewrights in town, but this isn't a complete list; it's intended to be a source of inspiration, examples of what magewrights on the frontier might be like.",
										"When dealing with magewrights, it's important to remember that they don't just cast spells as player characters do. Magewrights can cast cantrips freely and there's usually no additional cost for a service that employs a cantrip. A chef may use Prestidigitation to heat their food instead of a stove, but that's just a tool they use to do their job; as there's no extra cost to them, they don't have to pass that cost along to the customer. The restriction is that most magewrights only have access to limited versions of cantrips. Bel Thiel knows a version of Mending that works on metal, but she can't mend cloth; the reverse is true of Deven the tailor. Player characters are exceptional, and their versatile cantrips are one example of this.",
										"Other magewrights services are more costly. As described in Eberron: Rising from the Last War, when a magewright casts a spell, they do so using a ritual that takes between 10 minutes to an hour (at the DM's discretion based on the service and the spell). It requires components with a minimum cost of 20 GP multiplied by the level of the spell. That's just the cost to perform the ritual, with no profit for the magewright; per Eberron: Rising from the Last War, most magewrights charge 25 GP for a level 1 spell, 50 GP for a level 2 spell, and up to 100 GP to perform a level 3 Ritual. However, even if you have gold in hand and a magewright who can cast a spell, the fact that you're on the frontier means that they may not have the components they need to perform their ritual. Regardless of what's normally used, all magewright rituals can be performed using Residuum (refined dragonshard powder); Tuuva Mercantile carries Residuum, but generally has a limited supply. This sense of shortage is an element of frontier adventuring. Yenna Lane knows how to perform Lesser Restoration, but if a plague is spreading among the Mourners, odds are good that she simply can't contain it magically. It's not just about the cost in gold; the town just doesn't have enough Residuum for her to cure every victim.",
										"With that said, not all magewrights are magewrights. What defines the magewrights is that they cast leveled spells as Rituals, meaning they can cast them over and over as long as they have the components. But there are also arcane initiates, who effectively have the same ability as a player character who takes the Magic Initiate feat\u2014the ability to cast a few cantrips, and to cast a single leveled spell once per Long Rest without any expensive components. It's essentially a less dedicated form of training, reflecting the ability to produce a single burst of energy. It's rare to find an arcane initiate who can cast a 2nd or 3rd- level spell in this way, but it means that you might find a duelist who can surprise you with a quick Shield or a firefighter who can cast Burning Hands. They don't need gold to do it, but they only get to do it once a day.",

For now, no one knows just how far the mines extend, if all the discovered passages are connected, or even what ores can be found in their depths. Based on other findings in the region, it's quite possible that they hold veins of byeshk, an unusual metal that the Five Nations have yet to fully master.

However, gargoyles don't have to have horns or wings, and they can alter their form over time. Gargoyles reproduce by imbuing a sliver of their life force into a stone and burying it in gravel; this seed assimilates mass from the loose stone and builds its final form.",
				"Gargoyles have no need of food or drink. They are nearly immune to the passage of time and can remain standing still indefinitely. For any gargoyle, a fundamental question is why they choose to move at all. What drives them? There are a few common archetypes. Seekers are driven by curiosity, and love seeing new places and learning new things. Guardians devote themselves to protecting a person, place, or concept. Movers enjoy motion itself\u2014flight, fighting, dancing\u2014and often become scouts or soldiers. Thinkers are rarely seen, because they have the least reason to actually move; they live to ponder philosophies and ideas. A statue in a temple or a library could be a gargoyle priest or sage, lost in contemplation."

When pulled by a large team (typically eight tribex), a coach can maintain a speed of up to five miles per hour. However, if someone with the Mark of Passage attunes to the coach and sits in the driver's seat, the full magic of the Thunder Coach comes into play. Under such conditions, four strong beasts can pull the coach at a steady pace of ten miles an hour. If it is moving along an Orien trade road, the effect is further amplified, allowing a top speed of 15 miles per hour. This requires the driver to remain seated and to maintain {@status Concentration|XPHB}, as if casting a spell. However, beyond these limitations, they are capable of conversation and other actions.",

When closed, the gate is typically sealed with an Arcane Lock linked to a password known to the driver. The mouth of the extradimensional space is 10-feet-wide by 10-feet-high. The size of the extradimensional space varies based on the model of the coach; the standard is 20-feet-wide, 15-feet-high, and 50-feet-deep. The system maintaining the extradimensional space takes up the final five feet of the coach.",
				"Objects that produce extradimensional spaces (such as Bags of Holding, Portable Holes, or House Cannith's Crates of Containing) cannot cross the threshold of the rear compartment.
