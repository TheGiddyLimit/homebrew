						"Magic exists in countless forms, from the barely detectable to the massively obvious. Ley lines naturally bridge the gap between the subtle but pervasive source of magic and the concrete, applied force that moves mountains. Ley \"lines\" are actually channels where magical power flows like an invisible river wending across the landscape. They are called lines because length is their only measurement that has meaning in this dimension. Scholars and sages hotly debate the origin of ley lines, but their effects are undeniable.",
						"Ley lines fuel both arcane and divine magic. The lines themselves are invisible to normal sight, but divination magic quickly reveals their presence. To spellcasters trained to find them, ley lines stand out as glowing torrents of energy, pulsing bands of light akin to aurorae, or glittering strings.",
						"Ley lines are neither homogenous nor ubiquitous. Some geographic regions are rich in ley lines while others have none to speak of. They course through air, water, and solid earth with equal ease, but some environments, such as stone and narrow caverns, make them difficult to find and to trace.",

								"Ley lines tend to follow the contours of the land they flow across. At the same time, the terrain also reacts to the magical current. Learned spellcasters, most notably {@class Wizard|PHB|geomancer wizards|Geomancy|DM05}, can study the features of an area to determine whether ley lines are present and to gain insight into what effects they might produce. Creatures with close ties to the land can tell the difference between an area graced with a ley line and one without. Druids, rangers, woodsmen, farmers, even miners and architects have been known to learn the telltale signs of a ley line's presence and use them to their advantage.",
								"Natural pathways through the terrain (regardless of foliage) are easy channels for ley lines to follow. Like water, the magical power of ley lines follows an arcane path of least resistance; it's not uncommon for ley lines to follow or closely parallel waterways. Enterprising rulers and bold wizards sometimes manipulate the land to alter a ley line's path\u2014or at least, try to do so. Such meddling is delicate work, and it can have disastrous consequences if the job is botched. The benefits are tempting enough to outweigh the risk. Specific magical effects or even spectacular marvels such as chunks of rock or earth held aloft by the flowing power can be engineered via expertly channeled ley lines."

								"In the {@i Midgard Campaign Setting}, ley lines are an inextricable fixture of the world. They crisscross most of the surface world, sometimes tunneling through it or arcing above it, carrying magical power to all corners of the land.",
								"Most importantly, ley lines flow along mystical passages that traverse the planes. These passages are known as fey roads or shadow roads. Fey roads allow impossibly swift travel across Midgard, and those who know the secrets of their use guard them jealously.",
								"Ley lines have a particularly important place to the ramag of the Southlands. A chaotic network of atypically unstable ley lines ravages the Abandoned Lands where the ramag live, and the ramag work diligently to keep them at least somewhat under control.",

								"Spellcasters can tap ley lines to fill their spells with sudden bursts of power. While this can be dangerous, a skilled caster can create fantastic effects with extra power.",
								"Ley lines vary in intensity from weak trickles to titanic torrents of mystical power. In general, the more intense the ley line, the more potent its effect on magic and the more difficult it is to tap into.",
								"They are also classified as either unlocked or locked. These two categories are subjective; a ley line is locked only to individual spellcasters who've locked it, while it remains unlocked to all others. Locked ley lines produce predictable, repeatable benefits when worked into magic. Unlocked ley lines are no more difficult to tap into than locked ones (of the same intensity), but they are unpredictable and dangerous to use. They also bleed magical energy into the surrounding environment, which sometimes causes strange, unnatural effects in the neighborhood.",
								"To tap the potential of a ley line requires specialized knowledge, represented by either the {@feat Ley Initiate|DM05} feat or the {@class Wizard|PHB|Geomancy arcane tradition|Geomancy|DM05}. If your game doesn't utilize optional feats, you can instead allow a spellcaster who has a geomancer tutor or who has access to ample research material to learn the technique for tapping ley lines via training as a downtime activity.",
								"Once a spellcaster understands how to access the energy of a ley line, the procedure is straightforward. When a spell is cast within 30 feet of a ley line, the spellcaster can tap the line's power to augment his or her magic. This requires a successful ability check using the caster's spellcasting ability but without including any proficiency bonus. The DC of the check equals 10 + the level of the spell being cast. A successful check harnesses the power of the ley line, and the spell is modified according to the line's intensity (weak, strong, or titanic). If the check fails but the result is within 4 of the DC, the spell is cast normally with no bonus effect and no penalty. If the check fails by 5 or more, the spell is cast normally but the spellcaster suffers {@table Ley Line Backlash|DM05|backlash} {@homebrew |(see below)}.",
								"When a ley line is tapped successfully, the effect depends on whether the line is locked or unlocked. A locked ley line always has the same effect for the spellcaster who locked it. An unlocked ley line is unpredictable; every time it's tapped, the player rolls {@dice 1d10} and consults the table corresponding to the ley line's intensity ({@table Weak Ley Line Effects|DM05|weak}, {@table Strong Ley Line Effects|DM05|strong}, or {@table Titanic Ley Line Effects|DM05|titanic}).",
