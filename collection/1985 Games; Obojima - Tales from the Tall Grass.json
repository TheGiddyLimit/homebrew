				"In the tranquil groves where nature's harmony sings loudest, there exists a circle of druids attuned to the delicate dance of petals upon the breeze. These druid guardians of the natural world, known as the Circle of the Petal, draw their power from the spirit of Obojima, the steady island breeze and the ephemeral beauty and resilience of flowers. Embracing these subtle powers, they harness the whispers of the wind and the gentle caress of petals to weave their enchantments and shape the world around them.",
				"Members of the Circle of the Petal are revered for their deep connection to the sacred dawn petal tree and their ability to evoke its serene splendor in both peaceful sanctuaries and in dire situations. These druids become conduits of life energy, channeling the essence of blossoms into healing balms, protective barriers, and devastating bursts of floral fury. Guided by the eternal cycle of growth, bloom, and decay, they embody the ever-renewing vitality of nature, ensuring that even in the darkest of times, hope blossoms anew like petals on the wind.",

It can easily be moved or carried and always weighs 15 pounds, regardless of how much the objects it contains weigh. The pot is immune to all damage, but it can be dispelled."

Additionally, on subsequent turns, the wielder or one of its allies can use a bonus action to take a bite out of the blade.

Once a creature has taken a bite out of the blade, its damage die is reduced by one size\u2014from a {@dice d12} to a {@dice d10}, for example.

But she brought with her a hammer, for she had no intention of being eaten. A battle ensued.
