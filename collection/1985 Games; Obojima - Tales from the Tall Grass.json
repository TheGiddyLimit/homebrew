When a dara is about to die, their final act is to capture what remains of their soul and store it into a single glyph, which they place upon a tree. Known as a parting glyph, it is imbued with the dying dara’s identity, memories, and skills. There, the glyph waits until it can be claimed by a new dara.",
                        "A dara is born from the earth, emerging into Obojima, fully formed, through the roots of a tree that bears a parting glyph. Most are born from trees in the sacred grove in Roa Kala, the ancestral homeland of the dara (see page 94 for more on Roa Kala), but it could be anywhere a dara has died. When a dara leaves the soil, they are a blank slate, aware and without identity until they touch the parting glyph found at the base of their tree.",
                        "Parting glyphs give young dara a set of intellectual tools to function. In the form of memories, the glyphs offer the previous dara’s perspective about a world yet to be experienced. For many dara, the parting glyph leads them to Roa Kala and from there they choose their new life."

The jumping bonfire plant is the delight of children all over Obojima, and every village is sure to have one."

Dragon root burns hotter than most woods and coals and is therefore valuable to both brewers and smiths."

But she brought with her a hammer, for she had no intention of being eaten. A battle ensued. Aided by many spirits, Ineh smashed the fangs from Yutro’s maw, scattering them to the far corners of the island. Fangless, Yutro surrendered to Ineh and retreated into the mountain. To this day, however, Yutro’s fangs can be found in random places on Obojima, often embedded in the earth, in trees, or even in stone."

                "Arcane Detection Kits (or ADKs) have been popularized by witches in the last two decades as the desire for potions from local islanders has gradually increased. Although the contents of these kits vary depending on the coven and individual using them, there are a few staples found in nearly every kit, such as spark powder and arcana oil. No matter the contents, a skilled potion brewer can use the kit to sniff out the latent magic found in objects all across the island."

In Obojima, these small, sensory vignettes are the biggest tool in a GM’s repertoire.",

Most of these relics of metal and glass from the First Age stand as part of the landscape like any other rock or shrub. But many have been given renewed purpose. By means of magical enchantment, these once abandoned vending machines are operational again, but with magical trinkets on display. The trend is so widespread that it's safe to assume a machine found in decent condition is already claimed by a young wizard making plans to turn it into their own magical shop. Over the years, many boastful wizards and witches alike have claimed the idea to enchant vending machines was theirs, but that's an argument best left to historians.",

For every talented mage that enchants a vending machine, two talented thieves are plotting to steal the vulnerable goods. This is why most vending machines are protected by a guardian in the proprietor's absence. Guardians are often spirits, monsters, or another willing person who has entered a deal with the wizard. Of late, awakened cats have become the guardian of choice."

In addition to the (almost) instant gratification, it was discovered that the film cards these cameras use are sensitive to magic, which shows up as an aura in pictures. It was through the playful use of an instaprint camera that a family in Okiri Village discovered that their heirloom ladle was, in fact, enchanted with a powerful curse that soured every soup it touched.",

But since the great earthquake and tsunami three months ago, there has been more chatter than usual. There's the typical grumbling among farmers, ever concerned about the well-being of their crops and the worried talk from merchants about their wagons being slowed down by the whims of the island spirits. But there's more serious talk that has been drifting in from the far side of Obojima, the eastern side, where rumors and strange tales of a growing Corruption are beginning to spread across the island and get whispered by patrons in taverns and by travelers who cross paths on trails.",
                                "The odd and the mysterious are nothing new to Obojimans, so hearing about a weird patch of magic grass that hampers travel across the Gale Fields or an upwelling of bubbling pools of random goo that suddenly appears in a farming village, are something that Obojimans have dealt with on several occasions. Obojima is, after all, a land where spirits and magic are intertwined with daily life.",
                                "But there's a sense of worry about this particular anomaly. Perhaps it was because the Corruption was heralded first by an earthquake that shook the entire island, and then was followed by a tidal wave that caused the villagers on the eastern shores to run for the high ground. These events and the ensuing encroachment of this supernatural Corruption has the residents of the eastern side of the island quite alarmed.",
                                "For those who have seen the Corruption zones with their own eyes, it is their testimony alone that is helping to spread the news westward. But Obojimans are not wanderers by nature, so news is traveling slowly. The eastern witch covens are reacting to its presence with a mixture of arcane fascination, metaphysical concern, and, of course, devious witchery, and many of them are spending their time sampling the Corruption and exploring its magical implications and arcane efficacy in their potions and brews."
