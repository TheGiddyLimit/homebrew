When the second half of the potion is consumed, the first creature gains the ability to see through the eyes of the second creature, gaining the benefits of any special senses that creature has. While seeing in this way, the first creature is blind with regard to its own senses. Either creature can use its action to stop shared vision or reactivate it. This ability lasts for 8 hours, and it can't be used if the creatures are more than 1 mile apart."
