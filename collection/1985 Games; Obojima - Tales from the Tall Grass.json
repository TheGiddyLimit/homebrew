Dara often gravitate toward being wanderers, seeking out anything that interests them, and many scrawl notes and sketches as they are observing.

The spirit lived among the grass and called all that grazed the central fields of Obojima their friend, but of those creatures, none pleased Ventu more than the playful sheep dragon. In time Ventu and the sheep dragon became inseparable. The seasons would speed away, and still, the pair would frolic and parade the Gale Fields with careless glee. It's during this time that people say Ventu gifted the sheep dragon the ability to fly and control the winds.",
						"One day, as Ventu explored the fields, they noticed something unsettling in the distance. A great pillar of black smoke split the horizon in two. Ventu rushed across the rolling hills, only to be met by terrible disaster. A raging fire had scorched the southern fields and slowly crawled northward. Ventu, heartbroken at the thought of what might become of the sheep dragon just beyond the hillside, made the heroic choice to stand against the inferno by themself.",
						"To this day, it's unknown what became of Ventu, but the majestic sheep dragon stands as a testament to their kindness and bravery."

As a bonus action, you can target a creature you can see within 60 feet of you, enveloping it with the same cursed flames. When you deal damage with your curse markers to a creature that has been enveloped by your flames, each curse marker deals an extra {@damage 1d6} necrotic damage, instead of {@dice 1d4}.",

Legend says that when Fennistrix's taxidermy hut exploded, petrified alligator parts scattered all over the island. It's rare nowadays to find a foot or a head, let alone an entire alligator, but even a small amount of it ground up releases some of Fennistrix's potent magic."

But she brought with her a hammer, for she had no intention of being eaten. A battle ensued. Aided by many spirits, Ineh smashed the fangs from Yutro's maw, scattering them to the far corners of the island. Fangless, Yutro surrendered to Ineh and retreated into the mountain. To this day, however, Yutro's fangs can be found in random places on Obojima, often embedded in the earth, in trees, or even in stone."

Master Wufu only sells a few bottles of his whiskey to the highest bidder or gives them as gifts to old friends. Some think he is a spirit or a wizard as all attempts to track him have failed. Wufu whiskey is kept in beautiful earthenware jars, sealed with the Wufu emblem. Those who have tasted the legendary whiskey are said to have tasted the spirit of kings."

No matter the contents, a skilled potion brewer can use the kit to sniff out the latent magic found in objects all across the island."

Obojima is, after all, a land where spirits and magic are intertwined with daily life.",

The charismatic Voraro, a Nakudama known for his oracular powers, claimed he knew the destinies of all living creatures. Parents intent on knowing the fortunes of their children brought Voraro to Shoom. Once inside the ziggurat, the truth of Voraro's powers became known. He was a warlock who served a greedy and gluttonous spirit. Voraro used his magic to enthrall many midwives and offered the Nakudama eggs as tribute to his spirit patron. Unable to drive Voraro and the spirit out, it was decided to seal them in the ziggurat and abandon Shoom."

												"{@b Emille the Busker (male dara).} Emille is a busker who can usually be found on a street corner or on a rooftop somewhere in Ulawa playing his one-of-a-kind stringed instrument known as a pluckerine. The music he plays matches the mood of his surroundings, but whether he plays to the mood or sets it is not entirely known, such is the enchanting quality of his craft. Emille came to Uluwa looking for a music teacher, but his search carried him deep into the Spirit Realm where he bound himself to a spirit in exchange for musical talent. When he returned to Uluwa, it was with his pluckerine in hand and unmatched skill to play it. Though Emille is a relative newcomer to Uluwa, he is already a fixture. Unknown to most, his playing is a compulsion that is a consequence of the pact he made with his spirit patron. He is a melancholic figure who accepts his fate. He is an excellent source of information, and he can also be hired to play his magical tunes.",
												"{@b Throth With Eyes Everywhere (spirit).} The market's constable is also one of the more bizarre residents of Uluwa. Throth is a collective spirit entity made up of dozens of floating eyes that spread out throughout streets to monitor for thieves and other ruffians. Despite its name, Throth does not, in fact, have eyes everywhere, but it's fine having folks believe it to be true. When one of Throth's eyes spots a violation, it turns skyward and emits a powerful beam of light, alerting Uluwa's guards.",
												"{@b Humble Utzu (spirit).} This tiny spirit with a head surrounded in magical black flame is one of Uluwa's greatest smugglers and con artists. Utzu lives by the axiom that everything and everyone has a price, which means opportunity is around every corner. The diminutive spirit knows how to get just about anything, and if he doesn't know, he likely knows someone who does. Utzu refers to itself in the third person, always as \"humble Utzu.\" Finding Utzu is no easy thing, though the spirit spends most of its time in the Plaza of Lanterns.",

Bridge Cat has been here as long as anyone in Yatamon can remember, snoring away in what seems to be an eternal slumber. Every now and then, Bridge Cat may twitch an ear or yawn or shift positions. Sometimes when it yawns, it disappears into the Spirit Realm or when it exhales it momentarily becomes transparent. Apart from these slight variations, Bridge Cat never moves from this spot. Little kids can often be found playing on Bridge Cat and people from Yatamon come to rub Bridge Cat's belly for good luck and leave offerings and gifts for the spirit as it is said to bring longevity and a peaceful life.

Her sister, {@area Paloma|npc-paloma|x}, however, is an enigma to Holly, and while their relationship isn't necessarily strained, there is little affection between them.

Tan hails from Amak Shurak here in the Gale Fields. He was an awkward kid, who talked to himself constantly. On a visit to the town, Ognev met Tan and immediately recognized the kid's gift for spellcraft. He offered to take Tan on as an apprentice, and his parents were all too quick to agree. Ognev saw what everyone else missed. When Tan appears to be talking to himself, he's actually speaking to an invisible spirit that's always by his side. The spirit is named Abi, and it is quite protective of Tan. In his apprenticeship, Tan is learning to become a spirit medium and though he excels, he prefers Abi's company to that of other spirits.",

They've been here for as long as anyone remembers, and if they were companions to a particular witch at one time that witch has been lost to history. Both companions possess intelligence comparable to a child. One of them is a highly sociable spirit cat known as the Lady. The other is the Mighty Peapaleap\u2014a fat and fluffy long-haired cat who prefers to move about perched like a loaf on its floating square cushion. The duo tends to wander the grounds together, but one or the other will often branch off to follow a visitor it finds interesting.",

The coven does little to debunk such theories, as they only serve to enhance their mystique. The twin vaults, known as the Closed Fists, are kept deep within dungeons built into the foundations of the north and south towers. The northern vault is where the coven keeps the bulk of its store of ingredients. The domed chamber is lined with masks, several of which emerge as urugama demons who are bound to guard the vault.",

Each item in this vault is attached by a thin, silver chain to a small silver cage containing a mushroom. If one of these cages is disturbed, the mushroom inside begins vibrating and, after 10 seconds, it releases a cloud of spores that quickly fills the vault. Creatures within the cloud of spores must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or become paralyzed. When a creature first steps into the cloud or starts its turn within the cloud, it must make a saving throw. This effect lasts for 3 days or until neutralized with a secret concoction known only to the keeper of the vault. Undead and construct creatures are not affected by the spores. The cloud of spores dissipates after 5 minutes.",

This secret library, the Sanctum, is known only to certain members of the covens. The Sanctum is lit with hundreds of magic candles that eternally burn within small alcoves carved into the twisting halls of the cavern. Each alcove contains a single, exquisitely carved, small statue no more than five inches tall.",
														"Each one of these small statues, called a chot-to, contains a spirit that, like a book, knows a specific piece of knowledge\u2014a spell, a certain event, or a particular ingredient. All these statues combined make up the arcane lore and history of the witch covens.",
														"Chot-tos are carved out of many different kinds of stone, some are of animals and some look like people. Sometimes a chot-to is carved to look like one of the characters from the history that it contains.",
														"When a witch wants a particular bit of information, they must hold a magic keystone, state what they are looking for, and ask the chot-to to come forward. If the knowledge is contained within the Sanctum, the chot-to is then whelmed by its inhabiting spirit, animating the statue, and it hops from its alcove, scurries over, and begins divulging its lore.",
														"What people don't know\u2014even most witches\u2014is that there are always several chot-tos that are listening and recording every conversation and ritual performed while in the Sanctum. These spies remain motionless and only report to the Council of Three and Thirty."

												"AHA headquarters is home to seemingly countless ongoing studies, many of which are far from conclusive and only serve to add to the pile of questions in need of answering. Here are a few baffling discoveries that AHA members have yet to explain.",
												"{@b Something is Up with the Stars.} AHA observers have been watching the stars through the observatory's telescope for some time now and they have noticed a remarkable shift in the movement of the constellations. Ancient scrolls, that some say are from the time of the First Age, show star constellations and planets that are not recognizable or are no longer visible, and there are other charts from more recent ages that hint at long cycles of star patterns with decades of apparent stellar chaos. But the most recent measurements now show that the motions of the heavens have slowed considerably, and are no longer these lengthy cycles but are now short and strangely predictable.",
												"There is much discussion and debate within the observatory. Some AHA observers believe that the current data reveals that the stars are slowing down, which to them is a sign of an age of order, prosperity, and that the sky spirits are becoming calm and less agitated. But other observers believe that the island may have previously been adrift, like a leaf on a pond, and has somehow come to a stop, causing the stars to slow as well. Until the truth is uncovered (see the Mysteries section) AHA observers will continue their observations, theories, and will welcome any information adventurers can bring.",
												"{@b The Corruption.} Many studies and experiments have been put on hold in favor of researching the Corruption. At the moment, several rangers, who'd been among the first to respond to the Corruption's appearance, now live in one of the laboratory units under constant care and observation. Though researchers have yet to find a cure or even a way to slow the spread of the Corruption, they have made extensive notes about its effects.",
												"{@b The Disappearing Mountain.} Years ago, a mountain suddenly emerged on the horizon to the northeast of the island. It then traveled southward for two days until it disappeared again. It was never seen again. An expedition set out on a boat to find the mountain, but they never returned. This is an older mystery, but it remains an obsession of a small group of guild members."

He regards it as his baby, and he fastidiously dotes on it with great care. He is not miserly about the collection of books, theses, and records, and he is happy to share with anyone who demonstrates genuine interest in the topics found here. His manner is that of a teacher who believes everyone is capable of contributing worthy ideas, and it is his mission to capture them all. He carries with him a great shame, as he once allowed a charlatan scholar to abscond with a treasured tome of lore that detailed a network of caves in Mount Arbora.",

One floor has been turned into a living quarters for four rangers suffering the Corruption's ill effects. AHA researchers monitor them constantly for any signs of change. Other lab rooms contain aquariums that each contain fish that have skeletonized due to contact with the Corruption.

Scale's expertise is at dueling with one-handed blades, an art he has honed since he lost one of his arms in the jaws of a mighty sea spirit many years ago.

Scale, who was then known as Koren, was a new sword master, whose rising fame captured the spirit's attention. The two fought\u2014a battle that lasted a day and a night. At last, the spirit chomped down on Koren's arm. The pain was nigh unbearable, but it was enough to let him close in and drive his sword through the spirit's eye. Impressed with the mortal's resolve and willingness to suffer harm, the spirit decided to spare Koren, and actually transferred to him great power. At this moment, Koren became Scale, a testament to the connection between mortal and spirit.",

The prickly peach is found in one place, as far as the masters know, which is in a wild orchard in the southern reaches of the Gale Fields. The journey typically takes over a week on foot, so it requires some creative thinking to solve. There is no single correct method for accomplishing this challenge, so reward creative solutions. One thing to note is that when a prickly peach is picked, it gives off a rich, sweet aroma that attracts harpies.",
												"{@b Message in a Bottle.} This challenge speaks to Master Scale's love of diving. In the Shallows, not far from the beach, there's a narrow trench that contains the hull of a sunken ship. Master Scale writes a message in a bottle, and places the bottle in a chest in the hull of the ship. All the challenger has to do is discover the contents of the message and relay it to the master. The challenger can't use magic, but it's otherwise up to them how they will accomplish the task. To add difficulty, the ship can be occupied by a monster or two."

										"{@font {@style Island Weapons|large}|RoglianoUltraBold}",
										"Weapons unique to Obojima are described here.",
										"{@item Bellow Flute|ObojimaTallGrass}. The traditional Obojiman instrument has gotten a second life as a swift club-like weapon commonly used by traveling performers. It is crafted from a special coral found all across the shallows, which naturally forms with dozens of tiny holes that run throughout the body of the instrumental weapon. When swung it emits a beautiful harmonic sound.",
										"{@item Dandelion Spear|ObojimaTallGrass}. This strange and intimidating weapon was made for fishing in the reefs and crags of the Shallows. Its long haft is tipped with a spherical array of thin sharp barbs, which gave the spear its title, as its silhouette is reminiscent of a blooming dandelion.",
										"{@item Field Spear|ObojimaTallGrass}. Also known as the merchant's blade, the field spear was proven a useful and sturdy tool by the hundreds of merchants and travelers that use it in their expeditions across the island. Its shorter haft is roughly half the size of a standard spear and its tip is more similar to a wide blade or dagger than the traditional spear tip.",
										"{@item Lom Lom Dagger|ObojimaTallGrass}. The short and angular blade of a lom lom dagger was designed for cleaving and quickly became a staple in most of Obojima's kitchens. Over time, the blade length grew longer and longer, and eventually the lom lom dagger made its way out of the kitchen and into the hands of adventurers, who favored it for its balance and accuracy when thrown.",
										"{@item Nakudama Bubble Rod|ObojimaTallGrass}. The Nakudama bubble rod is most recognizable by the curious sounds it produces when used. The wet descending whistle of multiple water filled glass marbles shot from the end of the oblong tube, quickly followed by the unmistakable pop of the ammunition as they hit their target.",
										"{@item Secret Stone Sword|ObojimaTallGrass}. Although it's not much of a secret nowadays, the magical stone known as feather rock, which is used to craft these stone swords, was once coveted and kept hidden by the Nakudama. Even though feather rock is now commonly used by potion brewers, and the craft of making one of these swords is fairly common, the name has stayed the same.",
										"{@item Tapper Sack|ObojimaTallGrass}. A tapper sack is a simple tool and weapon used by farmers. At the end of a fine, yet sturdy, braided cord is a simple bag which has been filled with sand. Although it's not very flashy, in the hands of a skilled adventurer this humble weapon packs quite a punch.",
										"{@font {@style Special Weapons|large}|RoglianoUltraBold}",
										"Weapons with special rules are described here.",
										"{@item Boomerang|ObojimaTallGrass}. When thrown, the boomerang returns to an unoccupied space adjacent to you. As a reaction, you can choose to catch it.",
										"{@item Butterfly Staff|ObojimaTallGrass}. Although it can be used as a weapon, the butterfly staff is more commonly used as a tool to catch small spirits and critters. Its tall haft is capped with a well-woven net, which is often made from sheep dragon wool.",
										"When you make a grapple check while holding the butterfly staff, you can use the staff to target a Small or smaller creature that is up to 10 feet away from you. When you do so, you use your attack modifier for the weapon in place of your Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check. While grappling a creature in this way, you can't make another attack with the butterfly staff.",
										"{@item Candlemaker's Club|ObojimaTallGrass}. These heavy honey dipper shaped clubs are traditionally used for mixing the giant vats of wax used by the Courier Brigade to seal packages and craft candles. They're now used by postal knights and adventurers as a useful defensive and offensive tool.",
										"While wielding a candlemaker's club, you can use a bonus action to extinguish a flame within 5 feet of you.",
										"{@item Fan|ObojimaTallGrass}. When you're hit by a ranged weapon attack, you can use your reaction to reduce the incoming damage of the attack by a number equal to your Dexterity modifier.",
										"{@item Frying Pan|ObojimaTallGrass}. When wielding a frying pan, you can use your bonus action to add a +1 bonus to your AC until the end of your next turn. You can't gain this benefit while wielding a shield.",
										"{@item Shepherd Crook|ObojimaTallGrass}. As a bonus action, you can make a contested Strength check against a creature within range, moving the target to another unoccupied space within 5 feet of you on a success.",
										"{@item Umbrella|ObojimaTallGrass}. Whenever you take falling damage while wielding an umbrella, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage by a number equal to twice your proficiency bonus.",
										"{@item Vertebrae Sword|ObojimaTallGrass}. The jagged vertebrae sword of a fishfolk warrior can barely be called a sword. Locals would say it's better described as a makeshift weapon crafted from a fish skeleton and sea trash. Its poor construction is the reason it's not often a weapon seen on land, though when used by a skilled fighter, it most certainly can be a formidable tool.",
										"When you successfully hit a creature with a vertebrae sword, you can use a bonus action to rake and twist the weapon, breaking off some of the sword's boney barbs and dealing an extra 1d8 piercing damage. The vertebrae sword can only be used in this way 5 times before it becomes unusable as a weapon.",
										"{@item Vaulter's Axe|ObojimaTallGrass}. The vaulter's axe was designed by the Rangers of the Greenward Path for exploring the Brackwater Wetlands. Its tall haft allows wielders of the axe to easily check water depths and vault over obstacles. To this day it's a useful tool for anyone exploring the eastern side of the island.",
										"As part of your movement, you can use the vaulter's axe to launch yourself 15 feet over a creature or obstacle. Using your movement in this way ignores nonmagical {@quickref difficult terrain||3}."

										"Like their common counterparts, uncommon ingredients are found all across Obojima, though their uses outside of potion making are often more eclectic. The average islander is most likely aware of, or can identify a single uncommon ingredient. One such reason islanders are less aware of these more uncommon ingredients is often due to their affiliation with more dangerous locations or creatures.",
										"There are 45 known uncommon ingredients. It's been reported that the Fish Head Coven believes uncommon ingredients are roughly one hundred times easier to locate and procure than a rare ingredient. This would make a rare ingredient five hundred times more difficult to obtain than a common ingredient.",

										"One of the great joys in RPGs is when adventurers turn an enemy into a friend. This complicated relationship is rich, and the ongoing encounters with these characters can be quite rewarding for players. That doesn't mean that all antagonists are pals to be, however, and there's no guarantee that the players will have an appetite for friendship once an enemy crosses them. But as you plan your ongoing adventures, it might be helpful to think about your antagonists as existing on a spectrum. There are the antagonists that aren't all bad\u2013the lovable scoundrels, the knights loyal to masters who may be unworthy of them, the reckless wizards in over their heads, the dumb lunks who don't know their own strength, etc. But then there are the true baddies\u2013the villainous scum whose defeat is so sweet for the players.",
										"The way this dynamic often plays out in stories is that the protagonist first encounters what they believe to be the villain, only to later discover the existence of the true big bad. In an RPG, that discovery is a chance to recontextualize how the players regard the other antagonists\u2013the ones who aren't so bad by comparison. These characters might simply have goals that are at odds with the characters due to circumstance or misunderstanding. You might have an antagonist who the characters get along with, but they are sworn to an enemy. There could be a cursed warrior who has been tasked with capturing the characters in exchange for a cure. The options are limitless, but the point is that the evolving nature of the relationship that develops between them and the characters is a wonderful opportunity for satisfying storytelling."

Once atop the mountain, she transformed herself by absorbing her magic tail that had propelled her across the cosmos, and with that power, she lifted the rest of the island of Obojima above the surface of the waves.",

It is said that, after she laid her eggs, a shower of falling stars fell upon them and from these came the first royal dynasty of demi-god-frogs, from whom the rest of the Nakudama would spawn. She taught the first of the Nakudama the sacred tongue of Naku-Naku, taught them how to plant crops and till the soil. She taught them laws of how to conduct themselves and to seek out what is best in life.",
										"From the primordial waters many beasts and foul monsters coveted her island paradise and emerged to destroy Obojima or take it for themselves. The 10,000 Headed Hydra was the first of her challengers, which she decapitated with one great lash from her magic tongue. The second to emerge from the abyss of the ocean was the Great Terror Crab, which she crushed in a cleverly devised trap. This ingenuity would be a trait greatly admired and fostered in all her children.",
										"Legend says that it was the queen who first discovered the strange artifacts from another world and sought to gather them. She sent her best warriors across Obojima to collect a cache of these prizes for her most erudite wizards to study. To this day, the fabled cache of First Age objects has never been discovered.",

From this fabled act, the Nakudama derive their sense of community and selflessness, that all joys should be shared, not hoarded.",

Some legends say she vanished, others say she died, some say she went back to the cosmic sea and will one day return to Obojima.
