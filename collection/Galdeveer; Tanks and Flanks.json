				"Wish is the mightiest spell a mortal creature can cast. By simply speaking aloud, you can alter the very foundations of reality in accord with your desires.",
				"Cast another spell of 8th level or lower without expending a spell slot or its casting time. You do not need to know the spell or have it prepared. This spell's casting time is the casting time of the spell you pick. You don't need to meet any requirements in that spell, including costly components.",
				"Instead of casting another spell you can make a boundless wish. State your wish to the DM as precisely as possible. They decide the spell's casting time based on the wish. They have great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might only be partly achieved, or you might suffer some unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a legendary magic item or artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item's current owner.",
				"The stress of making a boundless wish instead of casting another spell weakens you. Each time you cast a spell until you finish a long rest, you take {@damage 1d10} necrotic damage per level of that spell. This damage can't be reduced or prevented in any way. In addition, your Strength drops to 3, if it isn't 3 or lower already, until you complete {@dice 2d4} long rests. Finally, there is a 33 percent chance that you are unable to cast Wish ever again."
