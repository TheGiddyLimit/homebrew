The weapons may change, from the hammers and axes of dwarven gods to the swords of the elves to the shortswords of the halflings. Regardless of the deity, though, the ability to bring holy or unholy damage to the fight is the hallmark of the war priest. Unlike a war chaplain, a war priest is always counted among the commanders of an army and is often a personal adviser to the army's general. In some cases, the war priest also serves as a general."
