								"An iconic moment in fantasy fiction is the grand tournament. From the archery contests of Robin Hood to the jousts of Ivanhoe, it seems like half the stories about the Middle Ages have the heroes attend such a festival somewhere along the line. Whether honoring the king's birthday, the birth of a saint, the nation's victory over its enemies, or just because it's Midsummer's Day, festive pavilions are raised and flags and pennants flap in the rising breeze to signal that it is time for the main event to begin! However, even in the real-world tournaments were about far more than bows and lances, and in a fantasy game the options for what would constitute a friendly (or even not-so-friendly) competition are infinitely varied, from gritty and brutal feats of raw strength to magical marvels of the highest fantasy. That is what Royal Tournaments is all about. It provides a fantastic resource for incorporating tournaments and festivals into your campaign, including an array of different tournament events and awards, some physical, some magical, some social, and all delightful. Whether your players want to promote the interests of their own kingdom or simply fight for glory and prizes, Royal Tournaments has everything you need to make the tournaments in your campaign magnificent and memorable. Legendary Games was founded on the principle of delivering first-class product for your Pathfinder Roleplaying Game experience, brought to you by the very authors who design and contribute to the adventures, hardbacks, and campaign supplements you are already using. The Legendary Games tradition is to combine rich story and background, innovative layout, beautiful aesthetics, and excellence in design that is second to none. This product is the latest in that tradition, and we hope you enjoy using it as much as we enjoyed making it. Game on!"

						"While player characters are used to living lives of high adventure with chances for glorious victory or potentially fatal failure lurking around every corner, they may sometimes lose sight of the fact that most people in the world they inhabit are not so lucky. True, the common folk perhaps have a different kind of luck, one which involves far less risk of death on a daily basis, but there is still something terribly romantic and exciting about being able to at least play at the kind of dramatics and heroics they hear about in the stories. That is where Royal Tournaments come in! Every now and then, it is time for a festival, and while competitions and mock battles often play a large part they are hardly the only element to entice the common folk. Festivals can be held for many purposes, and these are no different in a fantasy world than they are in the real world.",
						"Festivals can generally be divided into two categories: civic and religious. Civic festivals may commemorate the founding of a nation or a city, or the birth of a great leader or hero, or the overthrow of a hated tyrant. Celebrations may mark the day of a mighty battle, mixing celebration of victory with a solemn memorial of those lost in the struggle, or the consummation of peace after a long period of strife. Civic festivals may celebrate the life of a particular person of great renown, or they may be aimed at the entire populace. Likewise, they may be local to a single city or locality, or they may be widespread across an entire continent.",
						"Religious festivals may occur independently of any corresponding civic events. In some societies, the regular worship rituals of religion may be a weekly or daily occurrence, or even multiple times per day as the faithful are called to prayer by cathedral bells or the echoing calls of the priesthood. Other religions may have less structured worship routines, but nearly all commemorate the birth or death of saints or religious leaders in much the same way civic festivals celebrate secular leaders. Religious festivals, however, may also focus upon dates fixed by the dogma of the church for events beyond mortal ken, when their divine patron stepped foot upon the earth or first appeared to its acolytes in the spirit or in the flesh. Divine incarnations, interventions, apotheosis, sacrifice, resurrection, and more may be marked by the adherents of the faith with a celebration large or small.",
						"There are, of course, festive occasions that may fall into either category, especially those that are tied to the seasons. Such natural markers on the calendar often gain religious significance or may be considered sacred to many faiths. Special prayers may be offered up for the planting in the spring or the harvest in the fall, while Midsummer's may be a time for worshipful offerings or blessed marriages amid summer's bounty even as Midwinter's sees vigils throughout the long dark. This is particularly true in areas where druidical faiths predominate, but the religious associations with the seasons (if any) may vary a great deal from region to region and culture to culture. In areas where no one faith is dominant, cultural attachments around seasonal holidays may be far more important to the citizenry than any particular religious celebration. A diverse city or region may see multiple overlapping holidays celebrated in many ways among the different cultures and faiths present in the area.",
						"Even apart from the seasons, important events may be conflated and commemorated by coincidence, just because they happen to occur on or around a known local event or existing holiday. St. Crispin's Day, a minor holiday whose lineage is somewhat unclear, nonetheless was immortalized by Shakespeare's recounting of the Battle of Agincourt in Henry V. The possibly apocryphal saints still lend their name to the 25th of October, and for that matter to the rousing \"St. Crispin's Day speech\" that Shakespeare wrote nearly 200 years after the battle, but the memory of the day has evolved to be more a celebration of the band of brotherhood between warriors.",
						"In roleplaying terms, the nature of the festival is not critically important, other than to provide an overall theme and to help determine what manner of ancillary events, such as tournaments or contests, might be most appropriate. If you are using the Festival Edict rules in Ultimate Rulership (5E) from Legendary Games, civic and religious festivals provide different types of bonuses to your kingdom based on the buildings available in the city where the festival takes place.",

								"Festivals are typically held in and around a city, town, or village. However, during a festival, settlements are typically thronged with people, so unless the festival is a failure (see the Festival Edict rules in {@book Ultimate Rulership|UltRule}, reprinted in the Appendix of this book) you should treat the settlement as one size larger than its actual size for all purposes.",
								"In some cases, festivals may be held outside of any settlement, often near a Landmark (see Special Terrain the Kingdom-building rules in Kingdoms (5E) from Legendary Games). In this case, the number of attendees at the festival can be highly variable, depending on how significant the festival, how often other festivals are held, the season of the year, and how far travelers typically come to attend.",
								"Because of the high concentration of merchants and wealthy visitors (as well as black marketeers), the gp limit for buying and selling should be treated as a large city for the duration of the festival."

								"The thronging crowds present at a typical festival do not interfere with the ability of PCs to move around the festival, but if tactical movement and line of sight are important (as during a combat encounter), there is a 50% chance that when an encounter begins at a festival the PCs will be in the midst of a crowd 20 to 80 feet in diameter. Crowds provide cover, allow Dexterity (Stealth) checks, and are considered difficult terrain for movement purposes. A DC 12 Charisma (Persuasion) check or DC 15 Charisma (Intimidate) check allows a PC to convince a crowd to move in a particular direction (up to 30 feet per round), as long as the PC can be seen or heard.",
								"Finding a particular location in the festival grounds is a simple task to locate lesser-known merchants and locations. No roll should be necessary, especially if what is being sought is something available to the common folk. Finding information on specific people at the festival can be accomplished through Intelligence (Investigation) checks to gather information, or at the GM's option with Wisdom (Insight) checks to learn about common folk and Intelligence (History) to learn about the rich and powerful. The DC should be relatively low, but feel free to use this as an opportunity to disclose information that may feed into the adventure."

						"For the common folk simply attending a festival is a reward in and of itself, and low-level player characters can approach a festival the same way, as tourists and gawkers at the spectacle of it all. As PCs advance in level, however, they should see festivals as an opportunity to spread their fame across the land. They can do this by earning honor by showing mercy and gentility alongside prowess and might, gaining reputation and fame by drawing attention to themselves and their exploits, recruiting contacts and cultivating relationships, or even running a business or building up an organization.",
						"A tournament can serve as entertainment and an opportunity to engage in some contests and trials less dangerous than the normal adventuring life, but it also offers a great opportunity for adventurers to make an impact in the campaign world. This is doubly true if one or more of the PCs is ruling a kingdom, especially a new domain just trying to establish itself. They can put their newborn kingdom into the public eye amongst the notables and the commons alike from surrounding lands, earning prestige simply by being present for a major event. Of course, the more effort they put into promoting themselves the more prestige they can earn for themselves and their land, which will enhance their legitimacy, inducing other rulers to acknowledge them as equals and fellow rulers rather than up-jumped nobodies waiting to be picked off by their betters. This advancement in their fame and esteem is called Renown.",
						"{@b Starting Renown}: PCs can take a variety of actions that earn Renown, but their baseline Renown is equal to 5 before any further adjustments.",
						"{@b Keeping Up Appearances}: Whether PCs visit a festival, they may simply walk the grounds like the common folk or they may reserve a patch of the grounds for themselves and their accommodations. Even if they do not intend to stay at the festival overnight, putting up a structure displaying their ensign or flag is seen by others at the festival as a mark of their legitimacy. As a result, Renown is modified by their choice of quarters. PCs using magic to create their lodgings still must pay half of the above cost for the right to host their structure on the festival grounds. PCs may emulate a pavilion or grand pavilion with {@spell mirage arcana|phb} or similar magic, but each day they do this there is a cumulative 7% chance that they are discovered. Once the illusion is discovered, word gets around of the PCs' pretensions to glory and their Renown is reduced by 2.",

						"{@b King of the Hill}: A festival may have a particular spot reserved for celebrations, often a small hill or rise on the edge of the festival grounds, ringed in trees, for picnics and parties by day and revels by night by those wealthy folks who lack the title or privilege to claim an established pavilion. They can nonetheless attract the acclaim of errants and lesser noble scions and other untitled yet affluent folk by winning a lottery to host the celebrations for a night, wearing a crown as the King of Fools, a Crown of Holly, or a similar award. A chance in the lottery depends on the size of the festival, but is typically 1d10 x 10 gp. PCs who bid may roll a d20; on a natural 20, they win the crown and may invite any they wish to attend, but must provide music, food, and drink to all. They may provide entertainment themselves (or may hire a bard or other performer) and must provide 1d10 x 100 gp worth of food and drink, but they gain 1 point of Renown (see below) each time they win the honor.",
						"{@b Noble Boxes}: If the festival grounds have an arena for tests of skill and strength, such as jousting lists, archery ranges, racetracks, or more exotic competitions, PCs can build their repute by purchasing the rights to the best seats, nearest to the action and to the hosts of the tournament, rather than sitting with the rabble.",
						"{@b Making a Name and Spreading Your Fame}: In addition to simply establishing their presence with a pavilion or box seats for the grand events of the tournament, PCs can make an active effort at building the reputation of their domain. They can do this by personally entering and succeeding in contests and tournaments or hiring champions to do so on their behalf or by using their own skills and abilities. Each of the following methods requires a day of effort by one or more party members (cohorts may participate, and PCs able to make alliance with a noble patron with bards at his beck and call may be able to access their skills as well). Each effort requires the use of more than one skill; if one PC attempts to fulfill multiple skill requirements, all of their skill checks have disadvantage due to dividing their attention and efforts. If PCs succeed on all of the required skills (DC 12 each), they gain one point of Renown. If they fail one or more skill checks, they gain nothing, but if they fail all skill checks for a method by 5 or more, they lose 1 point of Renown. Each of these methods can be used more than once by repeating the effort on a subsequent day, but the DC increases by 2 each time a method is repeated.",
						"Success at one of these efforts can be awarded experience points as an encounter with a CR 2 lower than the party's average level."

						"A festival has all manner of common entertainments, minstrels, mummers, singers, jugglers, tumblers, trained animals, and on and on, but much of its allure is in the glory of competition. One factor to consider in preparing to run a festival or tournament is the level of magic available in the world. In a campaign where magic is rare and mysterious like that of Tolkien, simple fortune telling and fireworks are a marvelous spectacle that the folk at the festival may remember for years to come. In a typical fantasy campaign, however, magic is far more commonplace. Even small villages may well have a hedge mage or two capable of working real magic, or a cleric, or druid tending the local shrine. Even a 1st-level sorcerer or wizard can put on an impressive display of stage magic with spells like {@spell dancing lights}, {@spell flare}, {@spell ghost sound}, and {@spell prestidigitation}, and can go well beyond that with low-level illusions like {@spell minor image} and {@spell major image}.",
						"In addition to basic showmanship, the level of magic that exists in the campaign world on an everyday basis affects the kinds of events you include. A simple footrace in a low-magic campaign could become an exercise in super-speed or even a teleportation contest in a campaign saturated with magic power, horses replaced with pegasi and bowshots replaced with hurled lightning or psychic duels. The tone and feel of the campaign, as well as the level of the PCs, are important to consider when deciding what kinds of contests to incorporate into a festival.",
						"Whatever the style of contests you employ in your festival, including having different festivals each with their own focus, they are most enjoyable for players if their characters take part, and certainly other nobles in nearby lands may encourage them to enter, or even early in their careers to ride on that leader's behalf as her or his champions. PCs not directly involved in the contest still might enjoy watching the proceedings or making wagers on them, and you may also allow players to take the role of one of the NPC contestants (perhaps 'sponsoring' them or hiring them to compete in the name of their own land). Contestants can always yield in a contest if they wish, but such public surrender results in a loss of 1 point of Renown (see below), while winning a contest usually nets 1 point of Renown; if a contest has two different victory conditions and the same contestant wins both, that contestant wins 3 points of Renown. In addition, competing in such contests, while not generally dangerous in the same way as adventuring, still should be worth and appropriate xp award, typically as an encounter containing monsters that are roughly of a challenge rating of 1-3 levels below the PCs' own level.",

						"It is not just the events themselves where magic is relevant, however. Whatever the basic magic level of the world and the tournament, player characters themselves certainly have access to magic, and so too do significant NPCs, even if the rank and file competitors and spectators do not. Since magic does exist in the game world, it is entirely plausible that some competitors will seek to use magic (or other extraordinary means) to cheat, either on their own behalf or to bias the results of events in favor of one competitor versus another. Bearing in mind that festivals and tournaments are sponsored by the wealthy, this could mean that some sponsors might use such chicanery and skullduggery to favor their own champions in the contests, but it also means that the patrons of the event have the means and wherewithal to enlist magical sentries and to have warding effects in place to prevent cheating. Of course, such supernatural sentries may not be wholly trustworthy, as they are not necessarily obliged to enforce the rules honestly and fairly equally across the board. Corrupt contest marshals might look the other way when certain competitors come to the list.",
						"The attitudes towards cheating can be determined entirely at the GM's discretion, of course, but they also can be determined by the characteristics of the area where the festival is being held. Specifically, areas with high levels of Corruption and Crime (see the Settlement rules in Kingdoms (5E) from Legendary Games) are likely to be tolerant of cheating, while those with high levels of Law will take a dim view of such shenanigans. However, cultural, racial, and even religious attitudes may play a role in determining the level of dishonesty likely to be encountered.",
						"The capabilities of monitoring the competition depend on the resources of the hosts. Small local festivals may operate on the honor system out of necessity, but a festival sponsored by a king might have marshals (either in ostentatious uniforms, hidden amongst the crowd, or both) using spells like detect thoughts to check for evidence of cheating. Even in areas known for skullduggery, a host making a great show of striving for a clean competition might require competitors to use the equipment provided by the host, including clothing as well as arms and armor, to avoid them smuggling contraband items into the competition. Of course, Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks can be used to smuggle small items in despite such surveillance."

								"Virtually all cultures have strange cuisines that test the resolve and endurance of anyone brave enough to try them. Such food or drink might have a pungent and horrifying aroma or an overwhelmingly bitter flavor, or the food might simply look revolting and repellent. Most popularly, an iron stomach contest involves either extremely strong liquor that brings on near-immediate intoxication or exceptionally spicy food\u2014whether pickled, fermented, or even fresh off the vine\u2014that brings a nigh-unendurable heat that leaves competitors flushed, weeping, and gasping for breath. An eating or drinking contest also can feature fairly ordinary food and beverages in a race to see which contestant can gorge themselves, for example, on the most pies or sausages or can guzzle the most mead or milk in a set amount of time. To add an element of fun (or humiliation), contestants might have to eat or drink with their hands tied behind their backs or with some other handicap.",
								"To eat or drink such fare or in such quantities is a test of bravery as well as physical constitution, and spectators cheer for both the horror of the contestants as well as their sweat, tears, and grimaces of pain as they try to outdo their cohorts to down the most. In some barbarian tribes, iron stomach contests may be used as initiation rites to both purify the body and show toughness, though some visitors claim they are more of a sadistic prank the tribes play on outsiders seeking to trade with them.",
								"Whatever the exact nature of the food or drink used in the iron stomach contest, every competitor must consume at least one cup, plate, or other dish (or a whole fresh pepper or similar item), and at least one competitor must consume at least five within a set time limit (typically one minute) without passing out or regurgitating what they have tried to keep down. If no one finishes at least five, there is no champion and everyone loses 1 point of Renown. Anyone that passes out on the very first turn loses an additional point of Renown.",
								"Each dish consumed requires a successful Constitution saving throw to avoid becoming wracked with pain, nausea, and cramps from the awful gastrointestinal distress (or immediate intoxication) brought on by the food. The Constitution saving throw begins with a DC of 10 and increases by 2 for each dish after the first.  The first failed save causes the eater to become poisoned for one hour. A second failure leaves the eater poisoned for 1d4 minutes, and a third failed save causes the eater to fall unconscious for one round. A contestant that rolls a natural 1 on any saving throw must immediately attempt a new save against the same DC; if this save fails, he immediately falls unconscious for 1 round, even if it is his first failed save.",

								"{@b Broad Jumps}: A broad jump is a jump for maximum horizontal distance. There is a foul line that shows where the jumper must begin their jump; if they step over the line, the jump is treated as a foul and does not count. If the jumper's check results in an 8 or lower, they accidentally step over the foul line and are disqualified. In some cases, only a single jump is allowed, but in formal athletic competitions usually each contestant makes a set number of jumps (from three to six) and keeps their best result. The best overall result wins the contest, and in the case of a tie either both jumpers may be named the winners, or they may compare their second-best result or have them go to an additional jump-off. Long Jump: A long jump is a running jump. Standing Broad Jump: A broad jump is performed from a standing start. Triple Jump: A triple jump, also called a \"hop, skip, and jump\" is a combination of a single running long jump, after which the runner lands and immediately makes a second jump off one foot, and a third jump off of both feet. The third jump is treated as a standing jump with advantage. The total result of the three relevant checks gives the total distance jumped. High Jumps: A high jump is a jump for maximum vertical distance, done by jumping over a bar set at a target height, typically starting at 2 feet for standing jumps, 5 feet for running high jumps, or 10 feet for the pole vault, and all jumpers must clear this qualifying height. Jumpers who clear the height move on in the contest, while those who fail must try again. Jumpers who fail to clear three jumps (regardless of height) are disqualified. A natural 1 on a jump check to perform a high jump is an automatic failure. Once all jumpers have cleared the height or been disqualified, the bar is raised, typically half a foot at a time and the process is repeated. Confident jumpers who clear the qualifying height may pass on jumping at lower heights thereafter in order to save their attempts for later jumps. The process of raising the bar and new attempts for each remaining jumper continues at each new height, with any jumpers accumulating three failed jumps being disqualified. If at the end of all jumps at any height only one jumper left has cleared that height, they are the winner. If two or more jumpers remain, they proceed to the next height and continue the process until only one jumper remains. If neither jumper clears the new height, the jumper with the fewest failed jumps prior to the final height is the winner. If only a single jumper is left and they have not failed three jumps, they may choose to raise the bar and continue trying to clear higher heights for the sake of getting the best possible result, and the may continue trying indefinitely until they fail three jumps or until the sponsor of the contest calls for an ending.",
								"For the purpose of the contest, rather than setting a specific height you can use target DCs instead. This allows you to bypass metric conversions for jumping or worrying about the specific calculations of each height. You simply set the target DC for each height and have contestants try to meet or exceed it.",
								"{@i High Jump}: A high jump is a running high jump.",
								"{@i Pole Vault}: A pole vault is a running high jump that uses a flexible pole to provide leverage and spring to launch the jumper higher than they could under their own power. Using a pole allows the jumper to double the result of their Acrobatics check. However, if their vault is 10 feet or higher they also must attempt a DC 15 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check on the way down to avoid falling damage.",

								"Of course, characters might attempt a shove contest or otherwise attack other competitors.",
								"{@b Sprint}: Each contestant in a sprint race is assumed to take the Dash action, running a short burst in a straight line. Each racer multiplies their speed by 2; this number is their base race score. In addition, the start and finish of the race are of key importance. The start is represented by an initiative check for each runner, while the ability to run through the finish without tiring is represented by a Constitution check.",
								"The result of these two checks is added to each runner's base race score to give a total race score. In a simple sprint, the highest total score wins. In a large tournament, racers run in several heats, with the top two finishers in each heat moving on to the next round. Additional contestants with the best overall scores remaining from those who did not finish in the top two in their heat may be added to the next round as well.",
								"{@b Endurance Races}: Some races are run with multiple laps around a track or field, or on an open course, like a cross-country trail run.",
								"{@b Lap Running}: A running track is typically round, oval, or with parallel straightaways joined by curved ends. The precise shape does not matter, but the fact that runners must navigate those curves means that their speed is reduced to by 5 feet, affecting both their movement and Dash action. Each racer uses this run speed as their base race score.",
								"Unlike a sprint race, a lap race proceeds for multiple laps, each taking approximately one minute. On the first round of the race, all racers make an initiative check and add that result to their speed. The top three race scores may choose whether to begin the race as leaders, chasers, or trailers (see below). Leaders are running as hard as they can to take and keep the lead and put distance between themselves and the runners behind them. Chasers keep together and push the pace just enough to keep the leaders within reach without opening too big of a lead. Trailers conserve their energy and follow the leaders and chasers, waiting for fatigue to eliminate their competition and to win with a strong finishing kick.",
								"Each turn after the first, all runners make a Constitution check, adding the result to their race score for that turn (see below). The check begins at DC 8, with the DC increasing by 1 for each round after the first for chasers and by 2 for each round after the first for leaders (the DC does not increase for trailers). The result of this check determines the multiple of their speed that serves as their race score for that turn.",
								"{@i Falling}: Runners that fall must spend part of their next turn getting back up, halving their movement for the turn. In addition, a falling runner had disadvantage on the next Constitution check.",
								"{@i Exhaustion}: If a leader or chaser gain levels of exhaustion, they suffer from all relevant penalties until they succeed on a Constitution check, or reduce their speed by 5 feet for at least two turns. Runners cannot die from accumulating exhaustion levels, but they can have their speed halved or reduced to 0.",
								"A fatigued runner can remove all accumulated exhaustion levels gained in this way after a long rest.",
								"{@b Slowing Down}: On any race turn, a leader or chaser can ease their pace, reducing their speed by 5 feet. If they do this, they gain advantage on their Constitution check. This gives a different benefit if they have exhaustion level, removing a level of exhaustion after running at the slower pace for 2 turns.",
								"{@b Speeding Up}: On any race turn, a trailer can begin running full speed as a chaser or leader, making Constitution checks as normal. Once they start this finishing kick, they cannot return to being a trailer.",
								"{@b Winning the Race}: A race can continue for a set number of race turns, with the highest overall cumulative race score winning, or it can be a race to reach a previously specified race score. The racer who gets there in the fewest number of race turns is the winner, and if multiple racers get there in the same number of turns, the one with the higher overall score wins. In the rare instance of a tie, both racers are considered the winners.",
								"{@b Relays}: A relay is simply a race between teams of racers, who must pass a ring, flag, baton, or similar small object between them, or sometimes simply taps the next racer with their hand to signal the start of their course. The first runner takes the item from the start, runs their course, and then hands it to the next racer on their team (or taps them to begin), who runs their own race, and so on until each racer on the team has had one turn to race. The team with the highest total race score is the winner. However, relays are fraught with risk on the exchange, if a racer begins their stage before the previous runner has actually touched them or successfully handed off the relay item. At each exchange, the two racers must each succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity check. If both runners fail the check, the exchange is botched and their team is disqualified. If one succeeds and the other fails, the exchange is made but sloppily, and the delay causes the new racer to take a penalty on their race score equal to the margin by which the save was failed (and with disadvantage on a natural 1).",
								"{@b Steeplechases}: A steeplechase is a race wherein runners must leap over several obstacles on their way through the race course. Typically, these are logs or similar wooden barriers, requiring a successful DC 15 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to clear without incident. Each time a runner fails this check, he deducts twice the amount by which he failed the check from his final race score. If he fails the check by 5 or more, he falls prone (DC 15 Dexterity saving throw negates), and does not add anything to his racing score for that turn. If he falls, 1d3-1 other random contestants must attempt an additional Acrobatics check or be forced to stumble or even be knocked prone by the runner as he falls. While in a short sprint, a fall such as this is an automatic loss, in a longer race a runner may have time to get back up and resume running.",
								"In addition to simple hurdles or barriers, many steeplechase races add additional hazards, such as a pool of water or mud on the far side of the barrier (increasing the DC by 2 or by 5 to avoid stumbling or falling). In more brutal cultures, the barriers themselves or hazards beyond them may be spiked, bladed, laced with caltrops, or otherwise made deadly dangerous, or the barriers may have actual pit traps or similar threats in front of or behind them. Such hazards are resolved as normal for traps, falling damage, etc.",
								"{@b Riding Races}: Riding races combine the abilities of mount and rider to determine a winner. They generally follow the rules for sprint and endurance races, except as described below. On the first round of the race, the rider makes an initiative check, adding the mount's initiative modifier to his own. In addition, each rider must make a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check, adding the result to the mount's race score during the first turn.",
								"Mounts carrying a heavy load reduce their speed multiplier by 10 feet when figuring their race score in a sprint or in an endurance race. Constitution checks are made by the mount rather than the rider; however, each time the mount makes a Constitution check to determine its race score, the rider also makes a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check, and the rider may use the result of either the mount's check or the rider's to determine the mount's race score for that race turn. Negative effects of a failed Constitution check, such as falling or fatigue, still apply based on the result of the Constitution check itself and cannot be negated by substituting the rider's Wisdom (Animal Handling) check in this way.",
								"{@i Mounted Steeplechases}: These races function as a normal steeplechase, but the mount must make all Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks to clear the barriers along the race. For animals like horses that are not particularly agile, the base DC to leap such obstacles is 10, but steeplechases riding great cats or similar nimble creatures might have a higher base DC.",
								"Each time the mount leaps a barrier, the rider must succeed on a Dexterity (Animal Handling) check or thrown from his mount; the DC of this check equal to the DC of the Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to clear the obstacle. If the mount is not trained to leap barriers, the rider must coax the animal to leap over the obstacle with a successful Wisdom (Animal Handling) check with a DC equal to the Dexterity (Acrobatics) DC to leap the obstacle. If the obstacle is on fire or is otherwise obviously dangerous, this DC may be increase by 5 or even 10.",
								"{@i Token Races}: Some riding races involve collecting a token during the course of the race, such as a flag or brightly colored ring or baton, which is typically suspended from a rope or otherwise is difficult to reach and must be snatched without slowing down, since the race requires a combination of speed and successfully grabbing these tokens.",
								"A spectacular version of this kind of contest is the ring race, wherein fully armored knights propel their gaily caparisoned steeds around the racecourse while they use their lances to grab beribboned rings suspended overhead whose color matches their own. Each race turn, racers can attempt an attack roll against AC 15 (or higher, for contests aimed at higher-level contestants using smaller targets more difficult to catch) to snatch a ring at full speed. Trailers in a ring race gain a +2 bonus on their attack rolls, as their measured pace helps them focus on the dancing and swinging rings overhead. If the attack roll misses by less than 5, there is a 20% chance the attacker accidentally snatches a ring of the wrong color (chosen randomly).",
								"A racer who already has at least one ring on their lance who rolls a natural 1 on a subsequent attack roll or combat maneuver check must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or allow one of his rings already snatched to slip off, losing the points he would have gained from it.",
								"A ring race is scored as a typical race, with a +50 bonus to the racer's cumulative race score for each ring they've obtained of their color and +5 for rings of other colors, with an extra 50-point bonus if they collect all possible rings of their color. In some races, the number of race turns and the number of rings is equal, so that racers must successfully grab a ring every time to obtain the best score. In other ring races, the number of laps is greater than the number of rings, allowing racers multiple chances to collect all of their own rings or to interfere with their opponents' efforts.",
								"A racer that completes the race but fails to capture any rings of his own color is automatically disqualified. In unscrupulous ring races, a racer can use his lance to attempt a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) contest with an opponent to flick one of his opponent's rings off his lance, with a successful check removing one of the opponent's rings.",
								"{@b Swimming Races}: Swim races function similarly to land-based races for creatures with a swim speed; however, for most land-dwelling creatures swimming races use the following rules. Racers make an initiative check and a Constitution check at the beginning of the race, adding them together to get their base race score, and each round they spend swimming, they add the number of feet traveled to their race score (a successful Strength (Athletics) check against a DC based on the water conditions results in moving half the character's land speed). A swimmer who exceeds the Swim DC by at least 3 points adds a +1 to their race score.",
								"After each minute of racing, a swimmer must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution check or begin tiring, losing a number of points from her race score equal to the amount by which she failed the check. Each minute thereafter, the DC of this check increases by 1.",
								"Each race has a target race score, and the winner of a swimming race is the first racer to reach that score. If more than one racer reaches that score in the same round, the racer with the higher total race score at the end of that round is the winner. Like running races, swimming races can be organized into heats, with the top finishers in each heat advancing to the next round until a champion is determined.",

								"{@b Caber Tossing}: In Scottish highland games, a caber is a tapered log nearly 20 feet long and weighing 175 pounds, which must be lifted, balanced, and thrown so that the top end strikes the ground first, and ideally so that the caber falls directly away from the thrower.",
								"The competitor must first hoist the caber up off the ground, requiring a successful DC 17 Strength (Athletics) check.

If any of these ability checks fails, the caber is dropped. Depending on the competition, a single drop may eliminate a contestant, while in other competitions contestants may be allowed a certain number of drops before being disqualified.",
								"Once the caber is ready, the tosser must hurl it up in the air so that it falls top-end first, requiring a ranged attack (treat as AC 10, with disadvantage).

To determine the direction the caber falls on a successful ranged attack, roll 1d8, with a 1 indicating the caber falls directly away from the tosser and 2-8 rotating around the target in a clockwise direction.

								"In addition, while distance does not matter in traditional caber tossing, hurling an object for distance is likewise a feat of strength and technique, such as the Greek shotput or discus or the modern Olympic hammer throw. For such events, each contestant makes a ranged attack roll against AC 10 with disadvantage. If the attack misses, the throw lands out of bounds and is not counted. If the attack roll hits, the thrower additionally makes a Strength check and adds the result to his attack roll to determine his score. If throwing a weaponlike object, such as a dart, javelin, or spear, the attack roll does not have disadvantage if the thrower is proficient in the weapon.",
								"Throwing an object for maximum distance requires the thrower to spin, run, or lean into her throw for maximum power, and the thrower must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check after making the throw to keep her balance.

The side with the most bonuses grants a +1 bonus for that anchor's Strength (Athletics) check for every 4 points by which they exceed the other team's bonuses. Each anchor makes their checks, applying any modifiers for their team, and compare the result. The difference between the result of the checks equals the number of feet the center flag is pulled toward the side of the higher-rolling team at the end of that round. The tug-of-war is won when either team pulls the center flag over its boundary line.",
								"{@b Weightlifting}: The simplest test of strength is setting up progressively heavier and heavier weights for contestants to lift and hold, whether lifted overhead like a modern power-lifter, lifted and carried a short distance, or pulled on a sledge or track. For such weightlifting contests, any character can lift half their carrying capacity over their head automatically. Lifting and holding heavier loads in competition requires a Strength check.",

If they fail a lift, they can retry the same weight. Lifters continue increasing their weight as many times as desired until they fail a total of three lifts, at which point the highest weight they successfully lifted stands.",

								"For the joust, competitors are matched in a random draw. Each is equipped with a heavy horse, military saddle, lance, and heavy wooden shield, with racks of extra lances and shields. Riders may provide their own nonmagical armor. Attacking a horse is grounds for disqualification.",
								"Jousters can attempt to unhorse their opponent with a shove contest.",
								"{@b Tactics}: A jouster may choose to charge and force the opponent to make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + proficiency bonus + Strength or Dexterity bonus), to advance and attack normally, or to use the Dodge action. A jouster also can use other abilities, including class features like barbarian rage. Supernatural effects and spells are typically forbidden. Attacking the opponent's mount results in immediate disqualification.",
								"{@b Resolution}: Contestants spur their mounts forward and meet in the center of the list and initiative is rolled. If either contestant has an advantage in reach, that competitor has advantage on this initiative check. The winner strikes first, and unhorses the defender if the winner attack hits. If the rider who lost initiative is unhorsed, they can attempt a DC 20 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check as a reaction, with their shield breaking if they fail. If the check succeeds, the defender is able to get in a strike with their lance against the attacker, forcing the attacker to make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. If the stricken attacker fails this saving throw, they are unhorsed. If they succeed in unhorsing their opponent, that pass is a draw and both contestants can remount and try another pass.",
								"On any attack that hits, the lance breaks.",

If after three passes neither has done this, a point is scored for each shield broken and a point is deducted for each lance broken. If the match is still a draw, the contest continues until the tie is broken. After each pass, riders take 1 round to return to the end of the lists before charging again. Two squires at each end of the lists use their actions to replace a rider's lance or shield as needed.",
								"{@b Special Jousts}: In a fantasy game, jousts could be contests on flying, swimming, or even climbing mounts, given an arena of the appropriate type. The rules for such jousts are the same as for land-based jousts, though each mount also can make a Dexterity check, as appropriate, during their charge to see if they can gain an advantageous position relative to their opponent's mount.",
								"In special jousts, and aerial jousts in particular, flamboyance and showy aerobatics are a key part of the event, and the mount with the higher opposed Dexterity (Acrobatics) or Strength (Athletics) check also grants its rider advantage on any combat contests. Brightly colored flags, poles, or similar markers are placed at each end of the jousting field to mark where fliers should make their turn and approach the list for their next pass. In exotic jousts, these markers might have flaming rings the jousters must pass through (DC 17 Dexterity [Acrobatics] check required, plus a DC 20 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check to push a non-sentient mount to fly through the flames), plus a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw for both rider and mount to avoid catching on fire, while high-magic tournaments could have even more outlandish obstacles.",
								"While aerial maneuvers are expected before and after each pass, aerial jousts often are held close to ground level for the actual clash of lance against lance in order to minimize falling damage from competitors unhorsed in the joust. However, in some high-stakes tournaments the joust may take place in midair at a much higher elevation, with spectators watching from raised platforms, or the towers of a castle, or even the sides of a canyon or ravine. While weather rarely plays a role in low-level aerial jousting, high winds in such high-altitude jousts may impose a disadvantage on any relevant checks for both contestants.",
								"{@b Sample Competitors}: PCs wishing to compete must best a hedge knight trainer in the practice lists to demonstrate their basic competence. Success and an entry fee (the amount depending on the size and renown of the tournament, typically 10 gp for small local festivals and 100 gp for grander events) grants a place in the 5-round, single-elimination tourney. To determine a PC's opponent, roll 1d8 and add 1 per round.",
								"{@b Winning}: A jouster reaching the final four earns 1 point of Renown; increased to 2 points for reaching the final two, and 3 points for becoming champion. In a grand tournament, the four finalists receive a war-trained light or heavy horse. The two grand finalists receive 1,000 gold, and the grand champion receives a suit of +1 breastplate.",

The clout itself was a simple wooden peg a few inches across inside a circle drawn on the ground or marked with small flags and that might be as small as 2-3 feet across or as large as 25 feet. Modern clout shooting still exists and uses the same principle, but the target is more often a flag or square of cloth and scoring is based on how close archers can get their arrows to it.",

							"name": "Unarmed Combat Events",
							"entries": [
								"While jousting and even general melee events with blunted lances and swords were a staple of medieval tournaments, unarmed combat events also were very popular and continue to be popular to the present day. Such events often featured traveling champions who would take on local toughs and gallants willing to stake their money for a chance in the ring with the champion. Such events can be run using the standard combat rules for unarmed attacks and combat contest, and this is particularly appropriate in unusual unarmed events such as a humanoid battling a bear, gorilla, or similar creature with natural weapons of its own. However, the following rules below provide a framework for the sweet science of taking down an opponent with bare hands.",
								"{@b Performance Combat}: Whether using standard combat rules or the specialized rules described below, it is very appropriate to have contestants attempt to influence the crowd to their side make a DC 15 Charisma (Performance) check. Success grants you advantage on your next attack as you get the crowd to cheer you on.",
								"{@b Boxing}: Competitors are confined to a small ring, usually a 15-foot square, and set to fighting. Standard boxing is unarmed combat using only the hands, but many cultures may strike with both hands and feet or even with feet alone. Grappling, shoving, and most other combat contests are not allowed. After each round of combat, the boxers are separated and return to their start positions.",
								"{@i Gloves}: Traditional boxing is carried out with bare knuckles, but in some societies gloves are used to ablate the impact and reduce injury. Boxers wearing gloves cannot kill their targets, and they deal only half the normal amount of damage with each blow.",
								"{@i Knockout}: If either competitor is rendered unconscious by the reducing their opponent to 0 hit points, he is knocked out and his opponent is declared the winner. If a fighter confirms a critical hit during a boxing match, the target must make a Constitution saving throw equal to 10 + the damage dealt or gain a level of exhaustion, or two exhaustion levels if they fail the save by 5 or more. Rolling a natural 1 on this save renders the target unconscious. Any exhaustion levels gained in this way are removed when the afflicted boxer finishes a long rest.",
								"{@i Rounds}: A boxing match can last any number of rounds agreed upon by the contestants, though usually a minimum of 3 rounds and a maximum of 15. These rounds can be literal combat rounds, or they can be any length stipulated by the combatants, though rarely longer than 1 minute.",
								"{@i Scoring}: If neither opponent is knocked unconscious during the duration of the fight, the victor is determined by a scoring system. Each competitor tallies one point per hit and two points for each critical hit. In any round in which a fighter scores more hits than his opponent, he gains one additional bonus point. A fighter can use a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) contest to appear to land more punches than he actually does; this contest is opposed by the passive Perception of the judge(s) scoring the match, and the check is made each round. Both the fighter and the judge(s) add their proficiency bonus to these checks even if they lack proficiency in the appropriate skill as long as they are proficient with unarmed strikes. If a fighter's Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check exceeds the Wisdom (Perception) check of the judge(s), he is treated as if he scored 1 additional hit during that round, plus one additional hit for every 5 points by which his check exceeded the judge's highest Wisdom (Perception) check.",
								"{@b Special Boxing Rules}: Boxing can proceed using normal unarmed combat rules, or it can incorporate a number of specialized maneuvers and strategies. Bob and Weave: This is the boxing term for using the Dodge action.",
								"{@i Clinch}: One boxer grabs onto another as a defensive maneuver to prevent his opponent from landing effective punches. Treat this as a grapple contest. If the target's opposed roll is 5 or more points lower than the grappler, the target is has disadvantage on attack rolls until the end of next turn. A referee will usually end the grapple after 1 turn.",
								"{@i Combination}: As an action, the boxer can make two attacks, but does not add their Strength bonus on either attack.",
								"{@i Counterpunch}: A boxer can use his reaction to attack his opponent as they make their attack. This counterpunch is resolved after his opponent's attack.",
								"{@i Haymaker}: A boxer can put his whole energy into a heavy blow as an action, taking disadvantage on the roll in order to gain a +3 bonus on damage rolls.",
								"{@i Jab}: This is a standard unarmed strike.",
								"{@i Low Blow}: A blow below the belt is generally considered against the rules, much like a head butt, and in such cases making a low blow without being noticed requires a successful Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check contested by the passive Perception checks of the judges as described previously. If noticed, a successful low blow does not score a point and results in a 1-point penalty to the attacker. A successful hit with a low blow deals an additional 1d3 points of damage. In addition, the target must make a DC 8 Constitution saving throw or gain a level of exhaustion that goes away after the target finishes a short rest.",
								"{@b Wrestling}: Wrestling is a contest of combat maneuvers, especially (but not exclusively) the grapple contest. Shove contests are used to take a foe to the ground and make them easier to pin, while in other forms of wrestling such as sumo the object is to force the opponent out of the ring. Matches can be simple submission contests, wherein the match continues until one wrestler is subdued through maintaining a grapple for a certain number of rounds. Wrestling matches typically occur in a 15-foot diameter ring (which may be round or square), though larger rings may be use for tag team or group wrestling matches. The rules below present a formalized scoring system that can be used to reward specific maneuvers and outcomes.",
								"{@i Duration}: A wrestling match usually lasts a set number of rounds (usually 10, 12, or 15), though the match can end early if one wrestler maintains a grapple for 3 rounds. If neither wrestler can maintain, the match is decided on total points. If the score is tied at the end of the set duration, the match continues in a sudden death format, where the first wrestler to outscore his opponent in a round wins the match.",
								"{@i Exhaustion}: Wrestling matches take a considerable amount of energy. A wrestler can wrestle for a number of rounds equal to one-half his Constitution score before risking exhaustion. After this time, each wrestler must succeed at a DC 10 Constitution check or gain an exhaustion level at the end of each round. The DC increases by 1 for each round thereafter. When a wrestler gains an exhaustion level, the DC resets to 10 but additional checks must be made each round to avoid gaining further levels. A wrestler using a Dodge action does not need to make a Constitution check that round and reduces the DC of subsequent checks by 1. Exhaustion levels gained are never lethal and are removed after a short rest.",
								"{@i Give and Take}: Scoring occurs at the end of each round of a wrestling match. A grapple that is not maintained to the end of the opponent's turn scores no points.",
								"{@i Showboating}: Wrestling bouts can be simple athletic endeavors, or they can be grand spectacles with casts of colorful costumed characters with outlandish names and costumes to match, from masked luchadors or gloriously spangled and sequined performers with catchphrases, capes, props, and bombastic entrance music. These endeavors may still be highly athletic (though in some cases they may follow a prearranged script as to who wins or loses a match), but a Charisma (Athletics) check can be made in place of a Strength (Athletics) check.",
								"{@i Tag Team}: This style of wrestling pits two teams against each other, though only one wrestler from each team is on the mat at a time. At any time during the match, a wrestler can tag their partner and then exit the ring, while their partner enters the fray in their place. The partner outside the ring must stay in a specific location and cannot move around the ring to get closer to their partner.",
								"{@i Team Wrestling}: Some wrestling matches pit evenly matched teams against one another, with all wrestlers in the match at once. Scoring proceeds as described below, and wrestlers may choose to combine their efforts to pin and hold one of their opponents or may engage in multiple one-on-one grapples simultaneously. A wrestler who is grappled and held for three rounds is out of the match and the bout continues until all of one team's wrestlers have been eliminated, or based on the aggregate score for each team if both teams still have wrestlers remaining at the end of the match. Any successful point-scoring move by a wrestler counts toward the aggregate total for their team.",
								"{@i Unsportsmanlike Conduct}: In a wrestling match, you often can escape the view of any judges or referees, and dirty tricks can be used to put an opponent in a compromising position and gain advantage. Using an illegal hold or an unsportsmanlike maneuver such as an eye gouge, groin grab, strike with a closed fist, and so on without being noticed requires a successful Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check opposed by the passive Perception checks of the judges and your opponent. This is a bonus action, and you may choose one of the following options:",
								"Deal damage as if you had hit your target with your fist. Give your opponent disadvantage on Strength (Athletics) and Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks to avoid or escape your grapple.",
								"Give your opponent disadvantage on its next attack roll.",
								"If the dirty trick is noticed, the wrestler receives a warning and his opponent gains 1 point. A second dirty trick that is noticed results in the wrestler being disqualified.",
								"Because of the chaos and confusion of a match with multiple wrestlers on a side, Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks to perform a dirty trick combat maneuver without being noticed have advantage in a team wrestling match.",
								"{@b Scoring}: Scoring is checked at the end of each round:",
								"{@i Escape (1 point)}: You succeed on a grapple contest to break free from a grapple when your opponent has maintained the grapple at least once or has knocked you prone.",
								"{@i Hold (2 or 3 points)}: You succeed on a grapple contest to maintain your hold your opponent. If you maintain your hold for two consecutive rounds, you score 3 points.",
								"{@i Pin (victory)}: If you maintain a grapple for three consecutive rounds, you automatically win the match.",
								"{@i Reversal (2 points)}: You escape a grapple and make a successful grapple contest at the next available opportunity.",
								"{@i Stalling (warning, then 1 point to your opponent)}: If you use the Dodge action, you receive a warning the first time. Each time you use that action afterward, your opponent receives 1 point.",
								"{@i Takedown (2 points)}: You knock your opponent prone and succeed on a grapple contest in consecutive rounds. This may be done in either order; knocking them prone and then grappling them, or grappling first and then knocking prone.",
								"{@b Sumo}: Sumo and similar forms of wrestling do not rely on grabbing an opponent, but instead of forcing them to the ground or out of the ring with a shove contest. This also can be accomplished with a grapple when you force the opponent to move.",
								"Both wrestlers begin near the center of a 15- or 20foot ring, and must force their opponent back or to the side 10 feet to force them out of the ring, or knock them prone. Both wrestlers begin from a set position marked within the ring and roll initiative at the beginning of the match. In some cultures, the rules of sumo are considered sacred, and any unsportsmanlike conduct noticed by the judges is grounds for immediate disqualification and forfeit of the match. If you use a 15-foot ring, assume both wrestlers begin in the center square; if you wish a bit more movement opportunity using a standard grid of 5-foot squares, a 20-foot ring may work better.",
								"In the case of a shove contest, the winner can move both his opponent and himself 5 feet. If the opponent's contested check is 5 points or more lower than the attacker, they are knocked prone and lose that match.",
								"The first wrestler to be knocked prone or forcibly moved out of the ring loses the match; unlike the wrestling match described above, the match ends as soon as either wrestler is defeated in this way, without a chance for the defender to retaliate.",
								"Once a wrestler is defeated, if the match is going to continue, both wrestlers retake their positions at the center of the mat.",
								"{@b Scoring}: A sumo contest typically consists of a set number of matches, either within the same day or over a span of days. In a single contest, two wrestlers might have five matches, with the winner determined by whomever wins the most individual matches. Tradition dictates that all matches in the set are completed, even if one wrestler has an insurmountable advantage in that set, both for the loser to demonstrate stoic aplomb in defeat and to determine total number of matches won if the sumo event stretches over multiple days and involves multiple wrestlers, as the winner of the highest aggregate total number of matches at the end of the event is the grand champion of that event."

The pillars always attempt a saving throw (with a flat bonus of +5) against effects which allow a saving throw.",
								"Physically, each pillar has AC 16, Damage Threshold of 3, and 12 hit points, and they are not subject to critical hits when empty. For the purpose of radiant and necrotic energy, each pillar begins at 0 hit points, brightening with the respective energy type, up to 100 hit points of each. Pillars can absorb both types of energy simultaneously; they do not cancel one another out but accumulate separately, with light and dark spiraling around the pillar.",
								"Each competitor is given a colored token, and when they cause a pillar to reach 100 positive or 100 negative hit points, they 'capture' the pillar as it turns wholly white (radiant) or black (necrotic) and the crystal sphere mounted at the pillar's top glows brightly in their color. This is true even if another contestant has charged the majority of the energy into the pillar; it is the contestant who pushes the pillar beyond 100 radiant or necrotic hit points that captures it (this includes creatures summoned by a contestant).

An individual can take this challenge only once, though other characters may attempt it as well. At the conclusion of the companion spectacle, a strange thronelike chair of bronze metal is placed in the center ring, and the contestant is brought to sit upon the chair. Unlike the other games, the contestant can bring anything they wish, but if they are killed or quit the contest everything they bring within them becomes property of Madame Midnight, the mistress of the event and of the mystical Siege Mortis, the Seat of Death. They can abort the challenge at any time, ending it immediately, but if they surrender during the test they walk out with only their skin. They may cast preparatory spells before sitting the Siege Mortis, but spells lasting less than two minutes expire before the contest begins.",

During this time, Madame Midnight works the crowd, calling for bets for or against the contestant. After one minute, the contestant is surrounded by an illusory environment (as a mirage arcane, DC 18 to disbelieve) surrounded on all sides by transparent walls of force. From within, the walls of force appear to extend the terrain to the horizon; only on reaching the wall will a contestant realize where the end of the \"arena\" lies. Those outside the walls, however, automatically perceive what transpires within with true seeing, allowing them to view the proceedings without obstruction.",

								"The illusory environment can be anything, including buildings, and should be suited to the creature that appears. The environment provides no cover and successful disbelief allows a creature to ignore any perception of difficult terrain. Illusory structures, trees, and the like have a quasi-real structural framework that can allow a creature to hide, and even if disbelieved hinders movement as difficult terrain and can be climbed (DC 15). Quasi-real liquids can be swum (DC 10) or walked through.",

Surviving the Siege Mortis without slaying the enemy wins no Renown, but the PC keeps her gear. Slaying the quasireal creature(s) wins 1 point of Renown and a set of four elemental gems, one of each type.

								"In jousting circles, legends speak of a dreadful beast who roams the land to and fro, seeking whom he may devour among those who embody the chivalric ideal and who seek to demonstrate their purity and puissance on the tournament lists. Faceless and nameless \"black knights\" throughout the years have sought titles of achievement and honor in the tourneys while keeping their identity a secret, or have hidden their past shame beneath a mask or hood while they sought to repair their honor. Most trueborn and honorable knights avoid confrontations with them for fear of besmirching their own reputation by losing to an opponent of no repute (with little renown to be gained even in victory), and such knights typically have no recourse to compel their challenge to be answered. However, for decades knights who have refused challenges from nameless foes have been found murdered, their bodies battered, charred, and mutilated, with scarcely a trace found of their killers but a crude, sooty black mask drawn in the dirt. On a few occasions, a suspect has been found and even tried and condemned for such murders, protesting their innocence all the way, but even after their execution the respite was short before the murders began again, always with the same modus operandi.",

Not content to lure mortals of good heart to their doom through the typical sin of lust, she devised a rare plan to play upon pride and wrath, seeking out those paragons of goodness and mercy who sought to rise in public esteem and to be inspirations to the people at large. Her bestial son would instead seek them out in the guise of a common steed, or recruit a rider for himself willing to help take down the proud and the mighty, humiliating them on the field before slaughtering them once their fame and renown had been destroyed. Ashavin has recruited a long succession of accomplices, both as his personal riders and with a retinue of spies, informants, and allies always on the lookout for new targets.",
								"{@b In a Tournament Setting}: The growing fame and success of the PCs, or of one of their allies, in the jousting lists and in general heroics draws the attention of Ashavin and his marauding minions. He devises a plot to murder the target by infiltrating the jousting stables disguised as an ordinary horse, suppressing his smoke and flaming hooves. He attempts to lure the target into riding him, replacing grooms and valets with his own minions or intimidating others into sending PCs his way, making excuses about why other horses cannot be used in the list. Once a PC has mounted Ashavin, he uses magic to attempt to swiftly kill his rider. If he succeeds, he carries off the PC's body and gear, eventually mutilating the corpse to avoid raising from the dead and then leaving the body nearby.",
								"If the PC survives but remains astride him, Ashavin plane shifts to the Abyss and engages the PC in single combat; an unwilling PC can resist being taken with a successful DC 16 Charisma saving throw. If he already has used plane shift that day, he uses hide in plain sight and his ring to flee into the stables, where he has stashed a scroll of teleport, using it to return to his mercenary followers.

Effect For one month, your kingdom gains a +2 bonus to Law and Society, and the religious festival increases the effects of Cathedrals, Graveyards, Inns, Luxury Shops, Markets, Monuments, Parks, Shops, Shrines, and Temples in that settlement are increased (see Risks).",
								"{@i Determining Success}: When you issue a Festival Edict, make Economy, Loyalty, and Stability checks. If all three succeed, the Festival is a resounding success, doubling the effects of the buildings listed above; in addition, you gain the benefits of an Outstanding Success (01-50), Visiting Celebrity (51-95), or both (96-00) kingdom events.",
								"If two checks succeed, the Festival is a modest success, increasing the effects of the listed buildings by 50% for one month. Total the bonuses for all listed buildings in the settlement together before applying the 50% increase, rounding down; do not apply the 50% increase separately to each building.",
								"When buildings effects are increased (whether doubled or by 50%), this increase includes not only kingdom and settlement attribute modifiers like Economy and Lore; it also includes a doubling of Base Value and magic item creation during that month. This increase allows a settlement to exceed the normal maximum Base Value for a settlement of its size (either doubling or increasing it by 50%, as appropriate) for that month. It likewise creates temporary magic item slots that are filled immediately and can be used just like any other magic item slots in the kingdom. However, any magic items created in this fashion are available only during the month of the Festival Edict and the items and their slots disappear when the festival ends, being taken home by the crafters and merchants who brought them to the festival.",
								"If only one check or no checks succeed, see Risks below.",
								"{@b Risks}: Regardless of the overall success of the festival, the great influx of human(oid) and mercantile traffic involved creates the potential for enemy infiltration in the guise of pilgrims and festival-goers, or discord and strife between foreigners and locals or different groups coming together in one place, or just general drunkenness and mayhem should celebrants get out of control and overwhelm the ability of the settlement or the kingdom's ability to handle so many people in such a small space. During any month when a Festival Edict is issued, the entire kingdom takes a -2 Stability penalty, and any Stability checks required for the settlement or hex where the Festival is held take a -4 penalty (this does not apply to the Stability check to determine the success of the festival, but it does apply to any kingdom events triggered by the festival).",
								"{@i Unsuccessful Festivals}: If only one check succeeds, the Festival is unsuccessful and grants no benefits; in addition, there is a 50% chance that disgruntled citizens issue a Building Demand (as the kingdom event), blaming the lack of success on the absence (or presence, if they demand demolition) of that building.",
								"If all three checks fail, the Festival is a disaster, providing no benefits. The kingdom loses 1 point of Fame and gains 1d4-1 points of Unrest, and disaffected locals bankrupted by the festival and lingering troublemakers in the wake of the festival become Squatters (01-50), Vandals (51-95), or both (96-00), triggering kingdom events of the appropriate type.",
								"{@i Natural 1}: A natural 1 is always a failure on any kingdom roll, and each time you roll a natural 1 on any of the three kingdom checks to determine the success of the Festival Edict there is a 25% non-cumulative chance of triggering a dangerous settlement event. This event may be of any type, but only one such event can be triggered, even if you roll more than one natural 1."

You can invest any amount of BP (up to a maximum equal to your Renown) in this trade route, as if you had used a Trade Edict to establish the route, but the route is created immediately and grants you a +1 bonus to Economy for one year and increases your treasury by a number of BP equal to the trade route's route modifier (RM) plus 2d4 BP for every 5 BP you invested. Your settlement must have a Pier or Waterfront to benefit from a trade route that travels over water, as described in Kingdoms (5E) from Legendary Games.

This functions as a military unit owned by the PCs' kingdom for as long as the alliance lasts, but they do not need to pay upkeep or maintenance costs, as they are paid by their ally. Accepting the army requires the PCs to make a successful Loyalty check each month to avoid generating 1 point of Unrest; if they make three consecutive successful checks, their citizens accept the presence of the allied army and no further checks are required.

Alternatively, some of the countries offering treaties or alliances may be enemies and trying to pull the PCs' kingdom to their side.
