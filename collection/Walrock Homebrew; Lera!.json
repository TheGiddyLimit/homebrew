							"Unstirred by countless ages, the dark and dust find their eternal silence punctuated by an errant, erratic scratching. Stifled footfalls as soft as snow make their way through the forgotten corridors, the scratching producing faint echoes as it trails alongside them. Light splits the darkness, pouring from a small lantern on a staff, bound to the back of a tall yet delicate humanoid. Swathed in ruffs of fur, emanating a small cloud ofparticulate with each step, the figure's compound, insectoid eyes remain locked slightly downward, regarding a book and quill she holds in either hand.",
							"\"Tower contains only faint trace of magic,\" she whispers, nearly subvocally, as the quill scratches paper, \"Most artifacts pilfered with fall of magocracy, little clue to causes.\"",
							"Her footsteps suddenly stop, and her eyes raiseforward, sparkling with the lantern light. Looking tothe stonework at her side, she regards several large, knife-sized gouges raking through the crumbling edifice. Glancing then down past her writings, her eyes settle on the remains of a human skull, half-buried in the dust, adjacent to a dark stain upon the stones.",
							"\"Signs of struggle,\" she continues, \"Magical adversary. Summoning? Territorial? Aberrant, fey, or fiend likely.\"",
							"Shutting the book and placing it and the quill in a satchel at her side, she reaches for her staff, swinging its leather strap over her long antennae and diaphanous wings as she grasps it in both of her clawed hands. Lifting it aloft, the lantern swaying above her head, she brings it down with brutal force, shattering the human skull and sending a resounding clamor sweeping through the halls.",
							"She stands still, holding the staff directly in front of her. The only sounds to be heard are the trailing echo, and the slight groan of the lantern's cord as it sweeps aimlessly back and forth. Somewhere unfathomably deep below, a distant roar bellows in response, trickling back upwards across the stonework. Following it, a stream of obscene eldritch syllables, diluted into incomprehensible rage as it travels the halls. Then, footsteps: thunderous but dampened, and yet approaching.",
							"Calmly, the figure slips her staff once more onto her back, and retrieves her book and quill.",
							"\"Fiendish,\" she begins reading as she writes, \"Infernal. Can be reasoned with. Will have valuable knowledge of this place. Likely aggressive.\"",
							"Though she continues onward, her direction takes a sharp turn, making straight for the ominous clatter in the distance. \"Barter possible, not probable. Violence expected,\" she pens, as her lantern light shines forward through the antediluvian passages. Knowledge itself has value, and none know this better than the lera. Seekers of the forbidden and the forgotten, lera search after mysteries others fear, drawn inexorably by the lure of personal enlightenment."

Lera have delicate wings, and sometimescarry striking patterns across their wings and backevoking snowfall, a sunset, enormous eyes, a death's head, or similar.",

Atop a lera's head are a pair of long, lightly-tasseled antennae, which range from 1 foot to 3 feet long and waver in response to stimuli. A lera has adistinctly non-humanoid mouth, consisting of mandibles and a curled, hidden proboscis, used to pull in solid food and consume liquids respectively. Lera have no nose to speak of, and instead have scent receptors distributed throughout their antennae and mouth parts, allowing them to feel smells, rather than taste them.",
							"The strange facial anatomy of the lera makes understanding their emotions difficult for those not accustomed to their presence, complicated by the lack of intonation in a lera's speaking voice. Among those they trust, the lera will often state the emotional content of their communications outright: \"This makes me feel uncomfortable,\" or \"I am overjoyed at your presence,\" as examples. Among those they don't know, however, the lera are satisfied to leave them guessing."
