						"The follwing tables and rules require {@b Old-School Essentials}, and are generally compatible with any other Original, BX, or BECMI clone of the classic fantasy role-playing game.",
						"These tables provide an instant, retroactive story to explain why a character disappeared and was not around during the last session, when a player could not participate in the game.",
						"These tables aim at providing intereseting events to inject more story into the campaign. Sometimes the results are simple and bear little or no consequence; sometimes a result may produce a significant change in the character's story.",
						"The referee is expected to adree with the players on using these tables in their games.",
						"This is important because these tables often \"steal\" the power of decision from the players, determining specific courses of action for their characters, and these may have positive or negative outcomes.",
						"Use these tables when a player misses one or more sessions. The assumption is that the rest of the party continue playing, even though one of their comrades has somehow disappeared. There is no trace of them, no clue. As soon as the player joins the game again, it's time to answer the obvious question: {@i Where have you been?} The player rolls on the appropriate table, determined by the referee, who checks the table and informs them of the reason why their character disappeared and what they have been up to. If a player misses more than one session, the referee may require a roll for each missed session, using the appropriate tables required to catch up with the party.",
						"{@b Truth of Lies}: The tables tell what really happened. The player may always decide to tell a slightly or completely different story to the party, so the referee and the player should work it out aside from the other players.",
						"{@b Take Your Time but Make it Quick}: The referee and the player should take five minutes to work out the result, fleshing out the details where necessary, but not longer than that.",
						"{@b No Dying}: No result may cause the character's death. If a result drops the character's hit piints to 0 or lower, they are returned to 1."
