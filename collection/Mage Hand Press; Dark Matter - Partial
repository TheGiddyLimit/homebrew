                "You create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon that is no larger than a 1,000-foot cube. The image appears at a spot that you can see within range and lasts for the duration. It seems completely real, including sounds, smells, temperatures, and cosmic signals appropriate to the thing being depicted. You can't, however, create sufficient heat or cold to cause damage, a sound loud enough to deal thunder damage or deafen a creature, or a smell that might sicken a creature.<br>As long as you are within range of the illusion, you can use your action to cause the image to move to any other spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of an asteroid, you can make it rotate on its axis. Similarly, you can cause the image to make different sounds at different times.<br>Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because objects pass through it. The image does, however, fool sensor systems. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through it and the image's other sensory qualities become faint for that creature."

This mere fact has led to the utter annihilation of entire worlds, consumed by an endless tide of replicating machines who recursively stripped the world of all useful materials, destroying their creators in the process. Usually, these are isolated events; a disaster scenario that dooms an overly-ambitious civilization on one world, but when a replicating machine is built in space, it is an existential threat to all life in the galaxy.",

Individually, replicators aren't very intelligent or threatening; indeed, they're not even hostile, unless they detect useful materials. However, one always becomes many, and swarms of replicators are profoundly ruinous."

In the bowels of supercomputers, or among large networks of arcane terminals, where data is exchanged rapidly, computer bugs can aggregate and multiply into bluescreen swarms, which not only bring down whatever computer system they hailed from, but also pose a serious danger to creatures nearby. Bluescreen swarms can ravage an entire ship, attacking anyone that so much as carries technology or approaches a terminal. Worse still, they can fully absorb the radiant energy of blaster bolts and emit the excess power as waves of harmful radiation."
