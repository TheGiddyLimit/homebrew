While it has no eyes, it seems to be able to see just fine, and if it has you in its sight, you will feel a cold run through your body worse than any blizzard could force upon you. The chest of the beast is a skeletal form with patched up human flesh covering a large amount of it. The skin of it is far more resistance that one would expect as it is incredibly calcified and molded into the bones of the creature. The arms of it are impossibly long, giving it what seems like a 20 foot reach, they are covered with what seems like a cross between wolf fur and hardened bone, and it feels like a solidified knotted fur. The hands and feets of it are completely skeletal, vaguely humanlike hands, with claws at the end of each of the 5 fingers that seen to be near 4 inches long. The legs of the beast seem to be more inline with something like a deer, long and almost graceful in a way, if they weren't riddled with the same grotesque matted fur-flesh as the arms.",

Their time travelling have put a much lighter step in their heels and thus road dwarves whether on cart, mount, or foot seem to move about much more quickly and frequently than the average dwarf. Being more open to new things means it's not uncommon to spot a road dwarf bard recounting their adventures in a tavern or a master marksman and their trusty heavy crossbow."

For example, some of the oldest dwarves living in Citadel Felbarr (in the world of the Forgotten Realms) can recall the day, more than three centuries ago, when orcs conquered the fortress and drove them into an exile that lasted over 250 years. This longevity grants them a perspective on the world that shorter-lived races such as humans and halflings lack.",

They respect the traditions of their clans, tracing their ancestry back to the founding of their most ancient strongholds in the youth of the world, and don't abandon those traditions lightly. Part of those traditions is devotion to the gods of the dwarves, who uphold the dwarven ideals of industrious labor, skill in battle, and devotion to the forge.",
											"Individual dwarves are determined and loyal, true to their word and decisive in action, sometimes to the point of stubbornness. Many dwarves have a strong sense of justice, and they are slow to forget wrongs they have suffered. A wrong done to one dwarf is a wrong done to the dwarf's entire clan, so what begins as one dwarf's hunt for vengeance can become a full-blown clan feud."

They dislike boats, so enterprising humans and halflings frequently handle trade in dwarven goods along water routes. Trustworthy members of other races are welcome in dwarf settlements, though some areas are off limits even to them.",
											"The chief unit of dwarven society is the clan, and dwarves highly value social standing. Even dwarves who live far from their own kingdoms cherish their clan identities and affiliations, recognize related dwarves, and invoke their ancestors' names in oaths and curses.

A dwarf might seek to restore a clan's lost honor, avenge an ancient wrong the clan suffered, or earn a new place within the clan after having been exiled.
