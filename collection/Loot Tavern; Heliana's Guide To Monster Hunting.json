Its bite attack has a +6 modifier, while its breath weapon has a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. Subtracting the PB from these values (and 8 from the DC) we are left with +4 and DC 3.

								"As a tamer can only tame a CR 4 creature at 13th level, the wyrmling's PB increases from +2 to +5 when it be comes a companion. This results in its attack modifier and save DC increasing to +9 and DC 16 respectively."
