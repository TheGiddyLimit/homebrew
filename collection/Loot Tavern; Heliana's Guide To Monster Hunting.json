Luckily this is quite easy - it all depends on the creature's CR and players' PB. A creatures' base PB is +2 at CR 0-4and +3 at CR 5-6.",
										"Firstly, subtract the creature's PB from its modifiers/save DCs. Next, for save DCs, subtract an additional 8 from the DC. Finally, match the remaining values to the ability score modifiers.",
										"Let's use the CR 4 red dragon wyrmling's bite attack and breath weapon as an example. It has a PB of +2, a Strength of 19 (+4), a Dexterity of 10 (+0), and a Constitution of 17 (+3). Its bite attack has a +6 modifier, while its breath weapon has a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. Subtracting the PB from these values (and 8 from the DC) we are left with +4 and DC 3. We can deduce that the bite attack uses Strength (the +4 matches the wyrmling's Strength modifier), and the fire breath uses Constitution (DC 3 matches the wyrmling's +3 Constitution modifier).",
										"As a tamer can only tame a CR 4 creature at 13th level, the wyrmling's PB increases from +2 to +5 when it be comes a companion. This results in its attack modifier and save DC increasing to +9 and DC 16 respectively."

Served by a throng of kobolds, Tuckerthranx the Red called this caldera home. Home, that is, until a group of adventurers slew the fearsome dragon. During the fight to rid the land of this avaricious drake, the entire mountain collapsed. However, sustained by its magic, the lair teleported itself to the Maphrok jungle, where it laid dormant until an enterprising young biomancer\u2014Dr. Francis Norman Stein\u2014made it his laboratory.",

The substance slowly seeped out of its storage tanks, causing unsuspecting creatures to become unwilling participants in Dr. Stein's experiments.

Side-effects of the Mut-x included the polyhedroozes absorbing the latent psychic energy of an area; in this case, the prodigious greed of Tuckerthranx the Red.",

One of the clan's first tasks was to create a secure vault and transfer all the client's treasure there.

While house-sitting in Stein's wizard tower, Jonjo took the opportunity to create his phylactery using his favourite, perpetually-refilling amphora. Unfortunately, he confused a mimic with this vessel and the ritual went awry, dragging the biomancy-infused wizard tower into a maelstrom of magic.",

										"Years ago, Haemspire Peak was home to the Order of Haem, a hermitage for holy monks led by the magnetite dragon Lorhaem the Even and her offspring. This monastic order kept to themselves, unconcerned with the world and its wars, land grabs, and greed. Their tenet was a simple one: to maintain the Material Plane's neutrality in the eternal fight between the heavens and the hells.",
										"This order was broken when Volrak the Arrogant, an immense red dragon, laid waste to the mountaintop, destroying most of the monastery and slaying Lorhaem, who fought to ensure her offsprings' escape. In the melee, Lorhaem dealt Volrak a crippling injury. After Volrak's maiming, he became manipulative, cultivating a tribe of kobold followers whom he forced to plunder the environs.",
										"Years later, in the weeks leading up to this quest, Torhaem, one of the offspring Lorhaem sacrificed herself to save, returned to her mountain birthplace, ousting the indolent Volrak. In the battle, Volrak broke Torhaem's horn, causing her magnetic properties to become erratic. As Torhaem flew low over the countryside looking for her missing horn, she was drawn to Redriver, a small mining town. Passing over the settlement, a torrent of tools and weapons shot towards her, attracted by the erratic magnetic fields she generated. With each passing, more and more tools stabbed at her, until she was forced to retreat.",
										"Rumours abound amongst Redriver's townsfolk, but the general consensus is that Torhaem is stealing the tools on purpose in order to stop mining in the mountain and get rid of the settlement. Torhaem, on the other hand, believes that she is being shot at each time she passes over the town out of some enmity towards dragons. If the horn can be returned, Torhaem's control of her magnetic powers are restored, allowing her to release the tools currently stuck on her crown. Torhaem can then be convinced of the misunderstanding, and the tools can be returned to the townsfolk.",

His plan to make the kobolds leave work has succeeded and he is vying to get his former position at the factory back.",

Though the populace isn't aware of the perpetrators' identity, it is the kobolds that have been busy purloining all the bits, bobs, and other apparatus they need to create Quark's world-saving machine. Much to the chagrin of the local populace, this includes the town gazebo, which disappeared one night.

After arriving at the mining works, increasingly violent earthquakes herald the arrival of a swarm of tar elementals that become empowered when in proximity to arcane power sources.

						"This adventure, {@i Hare Raising}, is intended for 3 to 7 characters and is optimised for a party of 4 with an average party level (APL) of 4, 10, or 16. Characters who complete this adventure should earn enough experience to progress one third of the way to 5th, 11th or 17th level, respectively. The adventurers travel to the Bonefields, deal with several groups of unique NPCs, and tackle the bonemonger's osteomantic magic.",
						"While travelling to the Bonefields, the party has three scripted encounters with NPCs: the Grey Knight, The Knights Who Say Mi, and Jim the Enchanter. All three of these groups have interacted with the bonemonger in some way, and dealing with them imparts information as to how the bonemonger might fight. After battling the bonemonger's animated bones, the party can attack the \"dire rabbit\", as it is known to the locals. The fight need not be to the death; the bonemonger is actually a trader who can be persuaded to parlay, which is easier the more hurt he becomes.",

								"The bonemonger is obsessed with bones. He studies them in minute detail using his innate, insightful magic to learn each bone's history and extract from it arcane knowledge he uses in enchanting. Upon finding an area rich with osteomantic treasures, the bonemonger set up his hearth, a permanent part of his body that he decorates like a bower to attract a mate.",
								"In order to drum up business, the bonemonger used his osteomantic magic to animate the bones in the sepulchre, creating dozens of skeletal servants. Equipping these with all manner of pamphlets, brochures, and posters, he sent them forth, offering to trade his services as an enchanter in exchange for bones with interesting histories.",
								"To the chagrin of the inhabitants of Dullowmarch, an area of steep-sided woodlands and boggy marshland that surrounds the Bonefields, the cave in which the bonemonger built his hearth was the Sepulchre of Sorrow. Incensed by this desecration, the Dullovians marched on the Bonefields wielding pitchforks and torches, but they were no match for the bonemonger, a veteran of the dangerous Astral Plane. As a defensive measure, the bonemonger has since augmented creatures with his osteomantic magic to act as guards along the single safe path through the marshes to the Bonefields.",

Their remit was to protect travellers, hunt monsters, and maintain the lodgings that provided much-needed shelter in the depths of the wildlands. For a brief period, a golden age of flowing information and bountiful wealth bloomed. Before long, however, nefarious elements rose to the highest echelons of the organisation and subverted its once-noble goals.",
										"Gaia's Hearth had tamed the monsters. Gaia's Hearth had mapped the terrain. Gaia's Hearth had the ability to turn a bodyguarding job into a fullblown protection racket. For years thereafter, the re-named 'Gaia's Teeth' plagued the wildlands, fragmenting the once-thriving and interconnected communities into mistrusting and fortified towns.",

Pockets of these morally-defunct outcasts can still be found roaming the wilds, flying their banner of a world with teeth, and pillaging the innocent and defenceless. It is rare that such warchiefs ever aid one another or leave their preferred habitats."
