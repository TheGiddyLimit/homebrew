Brutal and vicious, creatures seeking out fang dragons should do so with extreme caution, as they will not hesitate to wreak havoc on any creature that they deem weaker them themselves and are perceived as a threat or an annoyance.",

They prefer to seek food far from their lairs, and will use their ability to mimic sounds they have heard to lure in prey. Fang dragons have a disturbing tendency to play with their food in an exceedingly cruel way. Fang dragons are masters of physical combat, and every part of their body is lethal. They do not have a breath weapon, but their bite is so devastating, that it can cause Constitution damage due to blood loss from the deep lacerations.",

Purple dragons burrow out their lairs, digging it out of stone and earth, and are most often found in the Underdark, where they prey on unsuspecting passersby, which are most often drow or svirfneblin. On rare occasions, purple dragons have dealt with humanoid races through mutual agreements - purple dragons are, in fact, smart enough to manipulate, and wise enough to understand when they have been outnumbered or when escape is unlikely. They are powerful though disloyal allies, although their pure strength is often enough to make up for their rapidly-shifting alliances."

These land and riverine predators are capable of carrying a platoon of lizardfolk long distances on raids. Often called river king or river dragon, they are worshiped by bullywugs and other primitive humanoids. Riding a dire spinosaurus requires an exotic saddle, riding platform, or howdah. These must be specially modified for its spines. It usually walks on all fours, but can walk more upright to attack with its lethal claws. Their eggs are worth as much as 2,000 gp a piece; live young are worth twice that. Rearing one requires patience, and a skilled lizardfolk handler.",

					"The murgul are a race that resemble a mix between a fish and a frog. They are famous for the gurgling sounds they make when they talk, and infamous for attacking their foes in large numbers. They were artificially created by the bronze naga, and serve them as labor and soldiers, as they count as being permanently charmed by all bronze naga. An exception are the so called \"renegade\" murgul, who are not charmed this way, and who are always cast out by other murgul. These murgul often start a career as adventurers, or form isolated villages with other renegade murgul. However, the \"renegade\" condition is not hereditary, and these villages will often join bronze naga if they come into contact with them. Even without their naga masters, murgul will organize themselves into caste systems similar to grungs. That, and their poisonous skin, makes some scholars speculate that they are part grung.",
					"Similar to their bronze naga masters, they have developed a taste for shark meat (and Sahuagin, as both taste very similar). They prefer to speak in Nerglish, as that is easy for them to talk in, and those who speak Draconic can understand this language."

Like true dragons, faerie dragons grow stronger with age, but they mature much more quickly and live shorter lives.

					"Bronze naga (page 20), or naga for short, are often the most pragmatic of half dragons. They are an enigma to most, and have a reputation for being deadly raiders. Many follow Lendys; dragon god of merciless justice, and often carry out attacks against \"evil\" targets or races. Most of their men are affected by the Dragon Rage transformation (page 138) but are also permanently changed into their Dragon Rage form. However they can still cast and concentrate on spells, wield coral weapons (page 119) at higher transformation levels, and they can only lose control due to the curse if they can see, smell, or hear a hostile creature while in combat themselves. Bronze naga players can choose this option with their DM's permission. Naga myrmidon are male naga who underwent special training and are able to control the dragon rage, while the female naga siren fulfill support roles.

While wearing this item, your unarmed strikes and natural weapons count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage, and you gain a bonus to attack and damage rolls with unarmed strikes and natural weapons which is determined by the item's rarity. If you are a monk then you can also add this bonus to special attacks related to your monk features that don't involve a weapon, a spell, or an unarmed strike (such as the sun bolts of the Way of the Sun Soul or the bending strikes of the Way of the Four Elements). If these special attacks deal bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, then they count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. If you already receive a bonus to attack and damage rolls with unarmed strikes, natural weapons, or these special attacks, then the bonuses don't stack and you use the highest bonus.",

Regardless of their origin, both races are generally on good terms. Half dragons' color patterns are similar to their draconic parent, and in the case of two half dragons having children, the child is often born in the color scheme of either parent, though occasionally they instead look like one of the other draconic ancestors of the parents, as half dragons are strongly drawn to one another and are known to quickly make families and form communities.

							"Half dragons look very similar to their mortal parent, except  for the horns and partial scales that cover their bodies, as well as their draconic legs and long tails. However, half dragons are more known for their dangerous elemental breaths, as well as the gift of transformation. While only a few half dragons eventually ascend to true dragonhood, some have been gifted with a \"lesser\" form that allows them a burst of power as well as the gift of flight for a short period of time. Half dragons are tall and strongly built, with males often standing close to six and a half feet tall and being taller and heavier than females. Most of their legs are covered in scales, which transition to skin at the lower side of their upper legs for females, and at the higher side of their upper legs for males, or for some males even at their lower torso. Their bodies below that line are more draconic than humanoid, as is their draconic tail and some other occasional parts of their upper body as well, with males having more scales and hair than females. Female half dragons on the other hand tend to have very little or no body hair, and while they are generally more fierce and assertive than other humanoid females, they also tend to be more feminine and submissive to their male partners. Scholars suspect this is due to their dragon heritage, where the roles of courtship are reversed. Similar to half dragons, there are more female dragons than male dragons, and females often compete or even fight for the right to court a male, to whom she must prove herself to be a desirable mate. However, half dragons are a race with strong individuals, so while most are naturally tended this way, not all are. Both sexes also gain an advantage based on which draconic heritage is more dominant for them."

Others are abandoned by the draconic parent or both parents and forced to survive alone or hope they get adopted by other half dragons or by dragonborn. Though those with a metallic dragon parent are, more often than not, properly raised and cared for. Half dragons who are adopted by dragonborn are brought in as part of the clan and are raised to be loyal to that clan. A continual drive for self-improvement reflects the self-sufficiency of the dragonborn race as a whole, which is then reflected upon the half dragon, who also value skill and excellence in all endeavors. They hate to fail, and they push themselves to extreme efforts before they give up on something.",
							"These dragonborn-raised half dragons hold mastery of a particular skill as a lifetime goal, alongside the desire to ascend to dragonhood. Members of other races who share the same commitment find it easy to earn their respect. Eventually, all half dragons have a universal drive to become stronger. By gaining strength in a multitude of ways, they find that they become more in touch with their draconic heritage, which comes forward in the forms of mastering their elemental breath, or even transforming into a dragon outright. This form is often not as strong as that of true dragons, except for those who are truly devoted and powerful. Such half dragons have \"ascended to dragonhood\", and become true dragons with all their terrifying might. This true dragon form, however, is not easy to attain and requires great devotion and resolve. But those who succeed are held in very high regard by half dragon society."

							"In recent years, half dragons have been forming communities at an increasing rate. This has created many half dragon families, and in turn, many adventurers as well due to their drive to ascend to dragonhood. Usually, however, many half dragons start a family and have children, with the mother being encouraged to take care of the children while the father goes out and provides for his family. Should the mother choose to become an adventurer, then the grandparents or one of the extended family will often take care of the children. While they are relatively few in number, half dragons are rapidly increasing their numbers due to a high fertility rate and big families. Most members of each community often share a similar color, based on one of their dragon ancestors. As such, these communities tend to have characteristics related to that dragon ancestor. For example, many half gold dragons, like their full-blooded kin, actively hunt down evil creatures, and their breath weapon is quite effective against such foes. Half dragon communities are protected by their elders, some of whom have already ascended to dragonhood and make for formidable opponents."

Kobolds are short in stature, despite the draconic blood running in their veins, with the tallest of them barely reaching 3 feet and weighing no more than 35 pounds. Because of their small size, kobolds often have to adopt unorthodox means of achieving victory. This usually leads to traps, which kobolds are well known for making, as well as using ambushes and distractions.",

Whole tribes usually are the same one or two colors, and the color of a kobold has no bearing on its abilities or skill set. Kobolds display many of the traits that true dragons display, and are often either proud, or vain (or both). While individual kobolds prefer to run away from a fight, they know that there is greatness within them, and they are proud that they are the blood-kin of dragons. Despite this, a typical kobold acknowledges its weakness in the face of a hostile world, as well as the superior might of true dragons. They find satisfaction in their work, the survival of their tribe, and the knowledge that they shares a heritage with mighty dragons.",

If the dragon expresses cruelty, they will tolerate it or simply go away instead of seeking revenge. They even display strong acts of courage while within their service.",
							"Strangely, they have the same sentiment towards dragonborn and half dragons, whom they consider to be dragons. This often leads to the annoyance of dragonborn, many of whom hold resentment towards dragons for past slavery. However, their obsessive loyalty and devotion, and their skill at handling the sewage of draconic communities, causes the other draconic races to tolerate their presence. And those that are able to put their pride aside acknowledge that more than one draconic community has been saved by using the kobold overwhelming numbers and unorthodox way of fighting.",

							"Kobolds are often dismissed as cowardly, foolish, and weak, but these little reptilian creatures are clever with their hands, and viciously work together in order to overcome their physical limitations. Kobolds are short in stature, despite the draconic blood running in their veins, with the tallest of them barely reaching 3 feet and weighing no more than 35 pounds. Because of their small size, kobolds often have to adopt unorthodox means of achieving victory. This usually leads to traps, which kobolds are well known for making, as well as using ambushes and distractions.",
							"Unlike the true dragons they worship, most kobolds don't have set colors that reflect certain personality traits. Whole tribes usually are the same one or two colors, and the color of a kobold has no bearing on its abilities or skill set. Kobolds display many of the traits that true dragons display, and are often either proud, or vain (or both). While individual kobolds prefer to run away from a fight, they know that there is greatness within them, and they are proud that they are the blood-kin of dragons. Despite this, a typical kobold acknowledges its weakness in the face of a hostile world, as well as the superior might of true dragons. They find satisfaction in their work, the survival of their tribe, and the knowledge that they shares a heritage with mighty dragons.",
							"While the individual kobold can be cowardly, this changes when they fight directly alongside their tribe. They believe that they will be rewarded in the afterlife if they die in the service of their tribe, and as such are far less fearful. Kobolds, aside from the occasional adventurer, are also quite content with their lives, provided they can mine and be with their families, and receive the occasional praise from dragons.",
							"Kobolds are renowned for their worship of dragons, in which case they cast aside any pride they have and willingly and proudly serve such mighty creatures without a thought of treason. If the dragon expresses cruelty, they will tolerate it or simply go away instead of seeking revenge. They even display strong acts of courage while within their service.",
							"Strangely, they have the same sentiment towards dragonborn and half dragons, whom they consider to be dragons. This often leads to the annoyance of dragonborn, many of whom hold resentment towards dragons for past slavery. However, their obsessive loyalty and devotion, and their skill at handling the sewage of draconic communities, causes the other draconic races to tolerate their presence. And those that are able to put their pride aside acknowledge that more than one draconic community has been saved by using the kobold overwhelming numbers and unorthodox way of fighting.",
							"Kobolds are naturally skilled at tunneling. Similar to dwarves, they have a near-instinctive sense of what sections of stone or earth are strong or weak, are bearing a load or are safe to excavate, or are likely to contain minerals or offer access to water.",
							"This ability enables them to fashion secure homes in places where other creatures wouldn't feel safe. Their favorite past time is bathing, and they are masters at finding natural springs and even hot springs.",
							"The latter also being quite popular among half dragons, and kobolds generally have no problem sharing these finds with mighty \"dragons\".",
							"Kobolds take advantage of their size by creating small-diameter tunnels that they can easily pass through, but that require larger creatures to hunch or even crawl to make progress. Due to their small size, many kobold often feel that there's safety in numbers. As such they rarely strike out on their own, unless it's a mission of great importance or they are serving or proving themselves to a dragon.",
							"A kobold can be fooled with smooth words or a quick wit, but when the kobold figures out it has been tricked it will remember the affront, and when possible will retaliate against that person somehow, even if merely in a petty way. Though they are far less grudgeful against dragons, feeling that they act so because the kobold must prove its worth.",
							"Urds, or winged kobolds, are kobolds who are born with wings. Some kobolds are more in touch with their draconic heritage and are known as dragonwrought kobolds, and are born among both regular kobolds and urds. However, most dragonwrought have wings, even if not all of them do. If you wish to play as a kobold with wings, you can choose this variant option (page 25) at character creation."

							"Despite their appearance, kobolds are descendants of true dragons. Kobolds are cowardly by nature and usually have a weaker moral standing than most other races, and as such they seem to have little in common with their draconic ancestors. Nevertheless, kobolds are quite capable crafters and builders, if they are instructed well enough. And they have an uncanny natural affinity for tunneling and laying traps. Kobolds can live up to 120 years, but their tendency of almost comedically getting themselves killed means they rarely live that long. They are the most numerous of all the draconic races, and they are also renowned for their teamwork. When fighting alongside other kobolds they are also far less cowardly. What they are most renowned for however is their worship of dragons, whose whims and even cruelty they readily forgive. This despite their tendency to be petty and spiteful if they don't receive the respect they believe they deserve as descendants of glorious dragonkind. No form of treachery comes to mind when a dragon is involved. And as far as they are concerned, dragonborn and half dragons are every bit as dragon as true dragons are."

Like the more civilized Kobolds, they are renowned trap makers and tunnelers. However, these wild kobolds often struggle to survive, and as such they are better trained at teamwork, as those that aren't are usually eaten quite early in their lives. Because of this they are less developed, and far more hostile. Kobold players may choose to sympathize with their less developed cousins, or they could be scornful, not liking how these even more cowardly kobolds give them a bad name."

These are generalizations, but overall they do tend to be highly positive towards dragonborn and half dragons, especially those that show them a shred of respect. Which doesn't have to be a whole lot all things considered. As such the other draconic races tolerate them, either annoyed or endeared, or both. Other humanoid races on the other hand are often met with suspicion, and the feeling is mutual. However, many kobolds are more open, especially if a good meal is involved. Gnomes however, are generally considered a racial enemy, though some kobolds can overlook that if the meal is sufficient enough."

With enough practice and experience, they can eventually use these wings for sustained flight as well. The influence of a dragonwrought kobold's ancestry is deep enough that they are granted several abilities. They are immune to magical sleep effects, and are resistant to paralysis as well as their draconic ancestor's elemental type. Those with chromatic ancestry live up to five times longer than regular kobolds, and those with metallic ancestors can live up to ten times longer. Which is impressive seeing as regular kobolds can live up to 120 years.",

They are the most numerous of all the draconic races, and they are also renowned for their teamwork. When fighting alongside other kobolds they are also far less cowardly. What they are most renowned for however is their worship of dragons, whose whims and even cruelty they readily forgive. This despite their tendency to be petty and spiteful if they don't receive the respect they believe they deserve as descendants of glorious dragonkind.

Kobolds are cowardly by nature and usually have a weaker moral standing than most other races, and as such they seem to have little in common with their draconic ancestors.

Kobolds can live up to 120 years, but their tendency of almost comedically getting themselves killed means they rarely live that long. They are the most numerous of all the draconic races, and they are also renowned for their teamwork. When fighting alongside other kobolds they are also far less cowardly. What they are most renowned for however is their worship of dragons, whose whims and even cruelty they readily forgive. This despite their tendency to be petty and spiteful if they don't receive the respect they believe they deserve as descendants of glorious dragonkind. No form of treachery comes to mind when a dragon is involved. And as far as they are concerned, dragonborn and half dragons are every bit as dragon as true dragons are."

							"It has long been known that many sorcerers have dragon blood in their veins, which allows them to naturally cast their spells without any formal education. The spellscales are proof of this, as they are often born when two sorcerers or a single particularly powerful sorcerer produces a spellscale as their offspring. Spellscales are draconic humanoids with an artistic flair, great intelligence, a talent for sorcery, and a great hunger for new experiences. Spellscales are, however, a distinct race. They breed true among themselves, and if one parent is a spellscale, their offspring will always be born as full blooded spellscales, regardless of the race of the other parent.",
							"Exceptions are tieflings, with whom the children are born as either parent, half dragons and dragons where they are born as half dragons (for the first seven generations), and lamia where their offspring are born as either spellscales or lamia. Spellscales embody the ego, individuality, and magic affinity of dragons, which is reflected by their flamboyant lifestyles.",
							"Many half dragons feel pity for them, as they are unable to ascend to dragonhood as they can, while the less pleasant among them mockingly call them \"mutts\". Spellscales however, generally don't care about what their stronger draconic blooded cousins say, as they are quite happy with their flamboyant lifestyles. They are known for their ability to meditate upon the concept of one of multiple dragon gods, to gain a benefit based on their choice. While spellscales meditate and seeks inner truth, they view their interpretations as subjective. They live life without lingering regrets. After all, everything they have experienced or done has contributed to the individual they are today. Sensibility, not sense, rules spellscales in matters of affection. They feel love and other emotions with grand intensity, and a spellscale is usually happy with who they are.",
							"Spellscales, their skin formed of lustrous smooth scales, come in a wide variety of hues including nearly every color of the rainbow. No spellscale is merely one color, but each displays a rich spectrum of variants on its main color. A spellscale who is primarily green might have patterns of a deeper, forest green over their body, fingernails and toenails of a slightly lighter green, and eye ridges and nostrils that are a deep greenish aquamarine. The coloration is complex, making a spellscale look much more elegant than other scaled humanoids such as kobolds or lizardfolk."

Spellscales prize magic above all else, considering it holy and giving it the reverence most other races accord to their deities. Spellscales believe that deities exist and are awesome, but magic is too, in a way that surpasses even the power of the deities. Spellscales alternately honor many dragon deities through their daily meditations, and they gain great spiritual satisfaction from their devotion to magic. Their rituals blend a sense of divinity in with sorcery, uniting both spirit and blood."

No other race finds the entire world so fascinating. They consider dragonborn distantly related creatures, like a third cousin by marriage. The dragonborn's singularity of intention interests spellscales, as they find it fascinating in a way, if terribly dull. Spellscales think dwarves are slow; ponderous in their physical movement, their social bonding, and their decision making. Nevertheless, dwarves are mesmerizing to observe in this slowness. Far from being boring, this activity is comfortable and reassuring, akin to rereading a favorite novel. Spellscales feel that, while elves have the right idea when it comes to holding a fine appreciation of magic, they're too academic in their approach to matters arcane.",
							"However, everyone is entitled to their own eccentricities, and the elves' racial penchant for wizardry over sorcery is peculiar but acceptable. Aside from this, spellscales see elves as graceful, free spirits who have a love of life nearly equal to their own. Spellscales wonder what place gnomes have in the multiverse, as they often seem content enough to stick to cantrips and low level spells without seeking more powerful and wonderful magic to practice.",
							"Most spellscales view these sadly hampered humanoids with a mix of pity and compassion, treating them gently, as one would a slow-witted child, to be protected and educated. Most spellscales' outlook toward half-elves can be summed up in a phrase: charming, quite charming. Half-elves have a resourcefulness born from a mixed heritage. They have poise and personality. And, like humans, a half-elf can do just about anything. They find that their flexibility and variability is to be respected. Spellscales find orcs overall a bit too crude and boorish to hold much social attraction for them, but half-orcs nevertheless prove physically fascinating. Not even half-orcs notice the nuances of their physiology.",
							"A spellscale might marvel at how one half-orc's lower teeth point inward and another's outward, or at just how capable a half-orc is in toe-to-toe battle and feats of strength. Fellow storytellers and agreeable folk, halflings and spellscales get along well. Spellscales appreciate how halflings fill many niches in the societies of other races while retaining a distinct outlook. Humans and half dragons appeal to a spellscales' curiosity, as they vary greatly in their lifestyles, ambitions, and philosophies. Each individual is unique and interesting. The human race and half dragon communities are young compared to true dragons or dwarves, adding to their charm. Spellscales treat both with a fond tolerance. Spellscales acknowledge that kobolds try hard as sorcerers, they really do, but to a spellscale they're far too limited in their talents and their worldview. The kobold race's inclination toward both strict loyalty and borderline worship of dragons perplexes spellscales.",
							"They ponder how a race with so much potential could limit itself with such philosophical baggage. And while spellscales admire and revere dragons, ever curious about them, they feel no particular attraction for them. Spellscales are naturally interested when presented with an opportunity to investigate a dragon's lair or converse with a friendly dragon, but they are equally fascinated to explore the nooks and crannies of a human city or delve into the depths of the earth. Spellscales acknowledge the link between themselves and dragons, but they view themselves as something apart from dragons and possibly, in a small way, superior."

However, half dragons are more known for their dangerous elemental breaths, as well as the gift of transformation. While only a few half dragons eventually ascend to true dragonhood, some have been gifted with a \"lesser\" form that allows them a burst of power as well as the gift of flight for a short period of time. Half dragons are tall and strongly built, with males often standing close to six and a half feet tall and being taller and heavier than females. Most of their legs are covered in scales, which transition to skin at the lower side of their upper legs for females, and at the higher side of their upper legs for males, or for some males even at their lower torso. Their bodies below that line are more draconic than humanoid, as is their draconic tail and some other occasional parts of their upper body as well, with males having more scales and hair than females. Female half dragons on the other hand tend to have very little or no body hair, and while they are generally more fierce and assertive than other humanoid females, they also tend to be more feminine and submissive to their male partners. Scholars suspect this is due to their dragon heritage, where the roles of courtship are reversed. Similar to half dragons, there are more female dragons than male dragons, and females often compete or even fight for the right to court a male, to whom she must prove herself to be a desirable mate. However, half dragons are a race with strong individuals, so while most are naturally tended this way, not all are.

While only a few half dragons eventually ascend to true dragonhood, some have been gifted with a \"lesser\" form that allows them a burst of power as well as the gift of flight for a short period of time. Half dragons are tall and strongly built, with males often standing close to six and a half feet tall and being taller and heavier than females. Most of their legs are covered in scales, which transition to skin at the lower side of their upper legs for females, and at the higher side of their upper legs for males, or for some males even at their lower torso. Their bodies below that line are more draconic than humanoid, as is their draconic tail and some other occasional parts of their upper body as well, with males having more scales and hair than females. Female half dragons on the other hand tend to have very little or no body hair, and while they are generally more fierce and assertive than other humanoid females, they also tend to be more feminine and submissive to their male partners. Scholars suspect this is due to their dragon heritage, where the roles of courtship are reversed. Similar to half dragons, there are more female dragons than male dragons, and females often compete or even fight for the right to court a male, to whom she must prove herself to be a desirable mate.

Half dragons are tall and strongly built, with males often standing close to six and a half feet tall and being taller and heavier than females.

Their bodies below that line are more draconic than humanoid, as is their draconic tail and some other occasional parts of their upper body as well, with males having more scales and hair than females. Female half dragons on the other hand tend to have very little or no body hair, and while they are generally more fierce and assertive than other humanoid females, they also tend to be more feminine and submissive to their male partners. Scholars suspect this is due to their dragon heritage, where the roles of courtship are reversed. Similar to half dragons, there are more female dragons than male dragons, and females often compete or even fight for the right to court a male, to whom she must prove herself to be a desirable mate.

Half dragons are tall and strongly built, with males often standing close to six and a half feet tall and being taller and heavier than females.

Female half dragons on the other hand tend to have very little or no body hair, and while they are generally more fierce and assertive than other humanoid females, they also tend to be more feminine and submissive to their male partners. Scholars suspect this is due to their dragon heritage, where the roles of courtship are reversed. Similar to half dragons, there are more female dragons than male dragons, and females often compete or even fight for the right to court a male, to whom she must prove herself to be a desirable mate.

Steel dragons can cast divine magic as arcane spells, which is one of the blessings they have received from Io. They are gifted shapechangers, and retain many benefits of their draconic bodies even while in their disguises. Their guise will age at the normal rate of the race they changed into, which they call Time Touching. When their mortal life will have run its course, they will shed their memories in a process called \"Vaulting\", where they will store their previous memories. That way they can live their next life without any bias and prejudices from their previous one.",

They will live multiple lives throughout their lifespan, called the \"chain of lives\". At the end of each life they will create a work of art that contains their collected wisdom; a teacher could create a book, and an adventurer could create a magical item. They will store these in a vault called \"the Composition\", which will be their legacy, to be shared at the true end of their life. They believe that Io created them for this purpose, to share the wisdom they have learned this way with others. Steel dragons spend most of their life in human form, except when they try to find a mate. After finding one they would start a \"semi-life\" where they live in a human form with their \"soul mate\", while taking care of their full-blooded dragon children in between, using their magic to disguise them. These children will then move to different cities once they are grown up, while the parents will create a new semi-life together, or go their own ways to meet up again later.",

									"Half steel dragons that live among humans appear as a human or half human, depending on the mortal parent. Half steel dragons in human societies would often live much of their life unaware of their true nature, but they could find strange occurrences that would hint at their heritage; such as a surprisingly durable skin, and an affinity towards metal. They would be unable to use their breath weapon, unless they were made aware of it. Either by their family or by great stress. When used, it would temporarily reveal their true nature to those within 30 feet of them, and make the half steel dragon aware of its true lineage. This disguise can not be detected by magic, but other (half) steel dragons will see through this deception. However, half steel dragons that live among other half dragons for an extended period of time will appear as they truly are, half dragons with horns and a draconic lower body. Through a secretive ritual, half steel dragons can change into other forms like their full blooded steel dragon kin can. Half steel dragons, like their dragon ancestors, prefer to talk instead of entering conflict. When they do fight, they generally avoid melee and rely on their magical spells, even though they can hold their own quite well. Remarkably, they have many Divine Soul sorcerers, which most believe is a blessing from Io. Steel dragons would sometimes organize themselves, but the vaulting would erase the memories of their half dragon offspring.",
									"As such, half steel dragons have created their own separate society called the Confluence, a loose and secretive association of half steel dragons. The Confluence originated with a pair of steel dragons, Auntyrlothtor and Quituryte. They fought against the malaugrym, evil shapeshifters, together with a group of noble women. In time, the two brothers produced half-breed offspring with these noble women, who were then raised in secret by the noble families of the original dames. These half-breed nobles proved vital in repelling the malaugrym when they subtly attacked again. In order to stop future resurgences, they founded the Confluence to control or eliminate any shapechangers who entered their cities."

While only a few half dragons eventually ascend to true dragonhood, some have been gifted with a \"lesser\" form that allows them a burst of power as well as the gift of flight for a short period of time. Half dragons are tall and strongly built, with males often standing close to six and a half feet tall and being taller and heavier than females. Most of their legs are covered in scales, which transition to skin at the lower side of their upper legs for females, and at the higher side of their upper legs for males, or for some males even at their lower torso. Their bodies below that line are more draconic than humanoid, as is their draconic tail and some other occasional parts of their upper body as well, with males having more scales and hair than females. Female half dragons on the other hand tend to have very little or no body hair, and while they are generally more fierce and assertive than other humanoid females, they also tend to be more feminine and submissive to their male partners. Scholars suspect this is due to their dragon heritage, where the roles of courtship are reversed. Similar to half dragons, there are more female dragons than male dragons, and females often compete or even fight for the right to court a male, to whom she must prove herself to be a desirable mate. However, half dragons are a race with strong individuals, so while most are naturally tended this way, not all are.

Though those with a metallic dragon parent are, more often than not, properly raised and cared for. Half dragons who are adopted by dragonborn are brought in as part of the clan and are raised to be loyal to that clan.

Members of other races who share the same commitment find it easy to earn their respect. Eventually, all half dragons have a universal drive to become stronger. By gaining strength in a multitude of ways, they find that they become more in touch with their draconic heritage, which comes forward in the forms of mastering their elemental breath, or even transforming into a dragon outright. This form is often not as strong as that of true dragons, except for those who are truly devoted and powerful. Such half dragons have \"ascended to dragonhood\", and become true dragons with all their terrifying might.

Usually, however, many half dragons start a family and have children, with the mother being encouraged to take care of the children while the father goes out and provides for his family. Should the mother choose to become an adventurer, then the grandparents or one of the extended family will often take care of the children. While they are relatively few in number, half dragons are rapidly increasing their numbers due to a high fertility rate and big families. Most members of each community often share a similar color, based on one of their dragon ancestors. As such, these communities tend to have characteristics related to that dragon ancestor. For example, many half gold dragons, like their full-blooded kin, actively hunt down evil creatures, and their breath weapon is quite effective against such foes. Half dragon communities are protected by their elders, some of whom have already ascended to dragonhood and make for formidable opponents."

Their bodies below that line are more draconic than humanoid, as is their draconic tail and some other occasional parts of their upper body as well, with males having more scales and hair than females. Female half dragons on the other hand tend to have very little or no body hair, and while they are generally more fierce and assertive than other humanoid females, they also tend to be more feminine and submissive to their male partners. Scholars suspect this is due to their dragon heritage, where the roles of courtship are reversed. Similar to half dragons, there are more female dragons than male dragons, and females often compete or even fight for the right to court a male, to whom she must prove herself to be a desirable mate. However, half dragons are a race with strong individuals, so while most are naturally tended this way, not all are. Both sexes also gain an advantage based on which draconic heritage is more dominant for them."

							"Half dragons look very similar to their mortal parent, except  for the horns and partial scales that cover their bodies, as well as their draconic legs and long tails. However, half dragons are more known for their dangerous elemental breaths, as well as the gift of transformation. While only a few half dragons eventually ascend to true dragonhood, some have been gifted with a \"lesser\" form that allows them a burst of power as well as the gift of flight for a short period of time. Half dragons are tall and strongly built, with males often standing close to six and a half feet tall and being taller and heavier than females. Most of their legs are covered in scales, which transition to skin at the lower side of their upper legs for females, and at the higher side of their upper legs for males, or for some males even at their lower torso. Their bodies below that line are more draconic than humanoid, as is their draconic tail and some other occasional parts of their upper body as well, with males having more scales and hair than females. Female half dragons on the other hand tend to have very little or no body hair, and while they are generally more fierce and assertive than other humanoid females, they also tend to be more feminine and submissive to their male partners. Scholars suspect this is due to their dragon heritage, where the roles of courtship are reversed. Similar to half dragons, there are more female dragons than male dragons, and females often compete or even fight for the right to court a male, to whom she must prove herself to be a desirable mate. However, half dragons are a race with strong individuals, so while most are naturally tended this way, not all are. Both sexes also gain an advantage based on which draconic heritage is more dominant for them."

Though those with a metallic dragon parent are, more often than not, properly raised and cared for. Half dragons who are adopted by dragonborn are brought in as part of the clan and are raised to be loyal to that clan.

By gaining strength in a multitude of ways, they find that they become more in touch with their draconic heritage, which comes forward in the forms of mastering their elemental breath, or even transforming into a dragon outright. This form is often not as strong as that of true dragons, except for those who are truly devoted and powerful. Such half dragons have \"ascended to dragonhood\", and become true dragons with all their terrifying might.

Usually, however, many half dragons start a family and have children, with the mother being encouraged to take care of the children while the father goes out and provides for his family. Should the mother choose to become an adventurer, then the grandparents or one of the extended family will often take care of the children. While they are relatively few in number, half dragons are rapidly increasing their numbers due to a high fertility rate and big families. Most members of each community often share a similar color, based on one of their dragon ancestors. As such, these communities tend to have characteristics related to that dragon ancestor. For example, many half gold dragons, like their full-blooded kin, actively hunt down evil creatures, and their breath weapon is quite effective against such foes. Half dragon communities are protected by their elders, some of whom have already ascended to dragonhood and make for formidable opponents."

							"Half dragons look very similar to their mortal parent, except  for the horns and partial scales that cover their bodies, as well as their draconic legs and long tails. However, half dragons are more known for their dangerous elemental breaths, as well as the gift of transformation. While only a few half dragons eventually ascend to true dragonhood, some have been gifted with a \"lesser\" form that allows them a burst of power as well as the gift of flight for a short period of time. Half dragons are tall and strongly built, with males often standing close to six and a half feet tall and being taller and heavier than females. Most of their legs are covered in scales, which transition to skin at the lower side of their upper legs for females, and at the higher side of their upper legs for males, or for some males even at their lower torso. Their bodies below that line are more draconic than humanoid, as is their draconic tail and some other occasional parts of their upper body as well, with males having more scales and hair than females. Female half dragons on the other hand tend to have very little or no body hair, and while they are generally more fierce and assertive than other humanoid females, they also tend to be more feminine and submissive to their male partners. Scholars suspect this is due to their dragon heritage, where the roles of courtship are reversed. Similar to half dragons, there are more female dragons than male dragons, and females often compete or even fight for the right to court a male, to whom she must prove herself to be a desirable mate. However, half dragons are a race with strong individuals, so while most are naturally tended this way, not all are. Both sexes also gain an advantage based on which draconic heritage is more dominant for them."

Though those with a metallic dragon parent are, more often than not, properly raised and cared for. Half dragons who are adopted by dragonborn are brought in as part of the clan and are raised to be loyal to that clan.

This has created many half dragon families, and in turn, many adventurers as well due to their drive to ascend to dragonhood. Usually, however, many half dragons start a family and have children, with the mother being encouraged to take care of the children while the father goes out and provides for his family. Should the mother choose to become an adventurer, then the grandparents or one of the extended family will often take care of the children. While they are relatively few in number, half dragons are rapidly increasing their numbers due to a high fertility rate and big families.

For example, many half gold dragons, like their full-blooded kin, actively hunt down evil creatures, and their breath weapon is quite effective against such foes. Half dragon communities are protected by their elders, some of whom have already ascended to dragonhood and make for formidable opponents."

However, half dragons are more known for their dangerous elemental breaths, as well as the gift of transformation. While only a few half dragons eventually ascend to true dragonhood, some have been gifted with a \"lesser\" form that allows them a burst of power as well as the gift of flight for a short period of time. Half dragons are tall and strongly built, with males often standing close to six and a half feet tall and being taller and heavier than females. Most of their legs are covered in scales, which transition to skin at the lower side of their upper legs for females, and at the higher side of their upper legs for males, or for some males even at their lower torso. Their bodies below that line are more draconic than humanoid, as is their draconic tail and some other occasional parts of their upper body as well, with males having more scales and hair than females. Female half dragons on the other hand tend to have very little or no body hair, and while they are generally more fierce and assertive than other humanoid females, they also tend to be more feminine and submissive to their male partners. Scholars suspect this is due to their dragon heritage, where the roles of courtship are reversed. Similar to half dragons, there are more female dragons than male dragons, and females often compete or even fight for the right to court a male, to whom she must prove herself to be a desirable mate. However, half dragons are a race with strong individuals, so while most are naturally tended this way, not all are.

While only a few half dragons eventually ascend to true dragonhood, some have been gifted with a \"lesser\" form that allows them a burst of power as well as the gift of flight for a short period of time. Half dragons are tall and strongly built, with males often standing close to six and a half feet tall and being taller and heavier than females. Most of their legs are covered in scales, which transition to skin at the lower side of their upper legs for females, and at the higher side of their upper legs for males, or for some males even at their lower torso. Their bodies below that line are more draconic than humanoid, as is their draconic tail and some other occasional parts of their upper body as well, with males having more scales and hair than females. Female half dragons on the other hand tend to have very little or no body hair, and while they are generally more fierce and assertive than other humanoid females, they also tend to be more feminine and submissive to their male partners. Scholars suspect this is due to their dragon heritage, where the roles of courtship are reversed. Similar to half dragons, there are more female dragons than male dragons, and females often compete or even fight for the right to court a male, to whom she must prove herself to be a desirable mate. However, half dragons are a race with strong individuals, so while most are naturally tended this way, not all are.

While only a few half dragons eventually ascend to true dragonhood, some have been gifted with a \"lesser\" form that allows them a burst of power as well as the gift of flight for a short period of time. Half dragons are tall and strongly built, with males often standing close to six and a half feet tall and being taller and heavier than females. Most of their legs are covered in scales, which transition to skin at the lower side of their upper legs for females, and at the higher side of their upper legs for males, or for some males even at their lower torso. Their bodies below that line are more draconic than humanoid, as is their draconic tail and some other occasional parts of their upper body as well, with males having more scales and hair than females. Female half dragons on the other hand tend to have very little or no body hair, and while they are generally more fierce and assertive than other humanoid females, they also tend to be more feminine and submissive to their male partners. Scholars suspect this is due to their dragon heritage, where the roles of courtship are reversed. Similar to half dragons, there are more female dragons than male dragons, and females often compete or even fight for the right to court a male, to whom she must prove herself to be a desirable mate.

This form is often not as strong as that of true dragons, except for those who are truly devoted and powerful.

Should the mother choose to become an adventurer, then the grandparents or one of the extended family will often take care of the children. While they are relatively few in number, half dragons are rapidly increasing their numbers due to a high fertility rate and big families. Most members of each community often share a similar color, based on one of their dragon ancestors. As such, these communities tend to have characteristics related to that dragon ancestor. For example, many half gold dragons, like their full-blooded kin, actively hunt down evil creatures, and their breath weapon is quite effective against such foes.

							"Half dragons look very similar to their mortal parent, except  for the horns and partial scales that cover their bodies, as well as their draconic legs and long tails. However, half dragons are more known for their dangerous elemental breaths, as well as the gift of transformation. While only a few half dragons eventually ascend to true dragonhood, some have been gifted with a \"lesser\" form that allows them a burst of power as well as the gift of flight for a short period of time. Half dragons are tall and strongly built, with males often standing close to six and a half feet tall and being taller and heavier than females. Most of their legs are covered in scales, which transition to skin at the lower side of their upper legs for females, and at the higher side of their upper legs for males, or for some males even at their lower torso. Their bodies below that line are more draconic than humanoid, as is their draconic tail and some other occasional parts of their upper body as well, with males having more scales and hair than females. Female half dragons on the other hand tend to have very little or no body hair, and while they are generally more fierce and assertive than other humanoid females, they also tend to be more feminine and submissive to their male partners. Scholars suspect this is due to their dragon heritage, where the roles of courtship are reversed. Similar to half dragons, there are more female dragons than male dragons, and females often compete or even fight for the right to court a male, to whom she must prove herself to be a desirable mate. However, half dragons are a race with strong individuals, so while most are naturally tended this way, not all are.

							"Half dragons look very similar to their mortal parent, except  for the horns and partial scales that cover their bodies, as well as their draconic legs and long tails. However, half dragons are more known for their dangerous elemental breaths, as well as the gift of transformation. While only a few half dragons eventually ascend to true dragonhood, some have been gifted with a \"lesser\" form that allows them a burst of power as well as the gift of flight for a short period of time. Half dragons are tall and strongly built, with males often standing close to six and a half feet tall and being taller and heavier than females. Most of their legs are covered in scales, which transition to skin at the lower side of their upper legs for females, and at the higher side of their upper legs for males, or for some males even at their lower torso. Their bodies below that line are more draconic than humanoid, as is their draconic tail and some other occasional parts of their upper body as well, with males having more scales and hair than females. Female half dragons on the other hand tend to have very little or no body hair, and while they are generally more fierce and assertive than other humanoid females, they also tend to be more feminine and submissive to their male partners. Scholars suspect this is due to their dragon heritage, where the roles of courtship are reversed. Similar to half dragons, there are more female dragons than male dragons, and females often compete or even fight for the right to court a male, to whom she must prove herself to be a desirable mate. However, half dragons are a race with strong individuals, so while most are naturally tended this way, not all are.

Half dragons are tall and strongly built, with males often standing close to six and a half feet tall and being taller and heavier than females. Most of their legs are covered in scales, which transition to skin at the lower side of their upper legs for females, and at the higher side of their upper legs for males, or for some males even at their lower torso. Their bodies below that line are more draconic than humanoid, as is their draconic tail and some other occasional parts of their upper body as well, with males having more scales and hair than females. Female half dragons on the other hand tend to have very little or no body hair, and while they are generally more fierce and assertive than other humanoid females, they also tend to be more feminine and submissive to their male partners. Scholars suspect this is due to their dragon heritage, where the roles of courtship are reversed. Similar to half dragons, there are more female dragons than male dragons, and females often compete or even fight for the right to court a male, to whom she must prove herself to be a desirable mate. However, half dragons are a race with strong individuals, so while most are naturally tended this way, not all are. Both sexes also gain an advantage based on which draconic heritage is more dominant for them."

While only a few half dragons eventually ascend to true dragonhood, some have been gifted with a \"lesser\" form that allows them a burst of power as well as the gift of flight for a short period of time. Half dragons are tall and strongly built, with males often standing close to six and a half feet tall and being taller and heavier than females. Most of their legs are covered in scales, which transition to skin at the lower side of their upper legs for females, and at the higher side of their upper legs for males, or for some males even at their lower torso. Their bodies below that line are more draconic than humanoid, as is their draconic tail and some other occasional parts of their upper body as well, with males having more scales and hair than females. Female half dragons on the other hand tend to have very little or no body hair, and while they are generally more fierce and assertive than other humanoid females, they also tend to be more feminine and submissive to their male partners. Scholars suspect this is due to their dragon heritage, where the roles of courtship are reversed. Similar to half dragons, there are more female dragons than male dragons, and females often compete or even fight for the right to court a male, to whom she must prove herself to be a desirable mate.

							"Half dragons look very similar to their mortal parent, except  for the horns and partial scales that cover their bodies, as well as their draconic legs and long tails. However, half dragons are more known for their dangerous elemental breaths, as well as the gift of transformation. While only a few half dragons eventually ascend to true dragonhood, some have been gifted with a \"lesser\" form that allows them a burst of power as well as the gift of flight for a short period of time. Half dragons are tall and strongly built, with males often standing close to six and a half feet tall and being taller and heavier than females. Most of their legs are covered in scales, which transition to skin at the lower side of their upper legs for females, and at the higher side of their upper legs for males, or for some males even at their lower torso. Their bodies below that line are more draconic than humanoid, as is their draconic tail and some other occasional parts of their upper body as well, with males having more scales and hair than females. Female half dragons on the other hand tend to have very little or no body hair, and while they are generally more fierce and assertive than other humanoid females, they also tend to be more feminine and submissive to their male partners. Scholars suspect this is due to their dragon heritage, where the roles of courtship are reversed. Similar to half dragons, there are more female dragons than male dragons, and females often compete or even fight for the right to court a male, to whom she must prove herself to be a desirable mate. However, half dragons are a race with strong individuals, so while most are naturally tended this way, not all are.

They will store these in a vault called \"the Composition\", which will be their legacy, to be shared at the true end of their life. They believe that Io created them for this purpose, to share the wisdom they have learned this way with others. Steel dragons spend most of their life in human form, except when they try to find a mate. After finding one they would start a \"semi-life\" where they live in a human form with their \"soul mate\", while taking care of their full-blooded dragon children in between, using their magic to disguise them. These children will then move to different cities once they are grown up, while the parents will create a new semi-life together, or go their own ways to meet up again later.",

									"Half steel dragons that live among humans appear as a human or half human, depending on the mortal parent. Half steel dragons in human societies would often live much of their life unaware of their true nature, but they could find strange occurrences that would hint at their heritage; such as a surprisingly durable skin, and an affinity towards metal. They would be unable to use their breath weapon, unless they were made aware of it. Either by their family or by great stress. When used, it would temporarily reveal their true nature to those within 30 feet of them, and make the half steel dragon aware of its true lineage. This disguise can not be detected by magic, but other (half) steel dragons will see through this deception. However, half steel dragons that live among other half dragons for an extended period of time will appear as they truly are, half dragons with horns and a draconic lower body. Through a secretive ritual, half steel dragons can change into other forms like their full blooded steel dragon kin can. Half steel dragons, like their dragon ancestors, prefer to talk instead of entering conflict. When they do fight, they generally avoid melee and rely on their magical spells, even though they can hold their own quite well. Remarkably, they have many Divine Soul sorcerers, which most believe is a blessing from Io. Steel dragons would sometimes organize themselves, but the vaulting would erase the memories of their half dragon offspring.",
									"As such, half steel dragons have created their own separate society called the Confluence, a loose and secretive association of half steel dragons. The Confluence originated with a pair of steel dragons, Auntyrlothtor and Quituryte. They fought against the malaugrym, evil shapeshifters, together with a group of noble women. In time, the two brothers produced half-breed offspring with these noble women, who were then raised in secret by the noble families of the original dames. These half-breed nobles proved vital in repelling the malaugrym when they subtly attacked again. In order to stop future resurgences, they founded the Confluence to control or eliminate any shapechangers who entered their cities."

							"Half dragons look very similar to their mortal parent, except  for the horns and partial scales that cover their bodies, as well as their draconic legs and long tails. However, half dragons are more known for their dangerous elemental breaths, as well as the gift of transformation. While only a few half dragons eventually ascend to true dragonhood, some have been gifted with a \"lesser\" form that allows them a burst of power as well as the gift of flight for a short period of time. Half dragons are tall and strongly built, with males often standing close to six and a half feet tall and being taller and heavier than females. Most of their legs are covered in scales, which transition to skin at the lower side of their upper legs for females, and at the higher side of their upper legs for males, or for some males even at their lower torso. Their bodies below that line are more draconic than humanoid, as is their draconic tail and some other occasional parts of their upper body as well, with males having more scales and hair than females. Female half dragons on the other hand tend to have very little or no body hair, and while they are generally more fierce and assertive than other humanoid females, they also tend to be more feminine and submissive to their male partners. Scholars suspect this is due to their dragon heritage, where the roles of courtship are reversed. Similar to half dragons, there are more female dragons than male dragons, and females often compete or even fight for the right to court a male, to whom she must prove herself to be a desirable mate. However, half dragons are a race with strong individuals, so while most are naturally tended this way, not all are.

Should the mother choose to become an adventurer, then the grandparents or one of the extended family will often take care of the children. While they are relatively few in number, half dragons are rapidly increasing their numbers due to a high fertility rate and big families. Most members of each community often share a similar color, based on one of their dragon ancestors. As such, these communities tend to have characteristics related to that dragon ancestor. For example, many half gold dragons, like their full-blooded kin, actively hunt down evil creatures, and their breath weapon is quite effective against such foes.

							"Half dragons look very similar to their mortal parent, except  for the horns and partial scales that cover their bodies, as well as their draconic legs and long tails. However, half dragons are more known for their dangerous elemental breaths, as well as the gift of transformation. While only a few half dragons eventually ascend to true dragonhood, some have been gifted with a \"lesser\" form that allows them a burst of power as well as the gift of flight for a short period of time. Half dragons are tall and strongly built, with males often standing close to six and a half feet tall and being taller and heavier than females. Most of their legs are covered in scales, which transition to skin at the lower side of their upper legs for females, and at the higher side of their upper legs for males, or for some males even at their lower torso. Their bodies below that line are more draconic than humanoid, as is their draconic tail and some other occasional parts of their upper body as well, with males having more scales and hair than females. Female half dragons on the other hand tend to have very little or no body hair, and while they are generally more fierce and assertive than other humanoid females, they also tend to be more feminine and submissive to their male partners. Scholars suspect this is due to their dragon heritage, where the roles of courtship are reversed. Similar to half dragons, there are more female dragons than male dragons, and females often compete or even fight for the right to court a male, to whom she must prove herself to be a desirable mate. However, half dragons are a race with strong individuals, so while most are naturally tended this way, not all are. Both sexes also gain an advantage based on which draconic heritage is more dominant for them."

Regardless of their origin, both races are generally on good terms. Half dragons' color patterns are similar to their draconic parent, and in the case of two half dragons having children, the child is often born in the color scheme of either parent, though occasionally they instead look like one of the other draconic ancestors of the parents, as half dragons are strongly drawn to one another and are known to quickly make families and form communities.

							"Half dragons look very similar to their mortal parent, except  for the horns and partial scales that cover their bodies, as well as their draconic legs and long tails. However, half dragons are more known for their dangerous elemental breaths, as well as the gift of transformation. While only a few half dragons eventually ascend to true dragonhood, some have been gifted with a \"lesser\" form that allows them a burst of power as well as the gift of flight for a short period of time. Half dragons are tall and strongly built, with males often standing close to six and a half feet tall and being taller and heavier than females. Most of their legs are covered in scales, which transition to skin at the lower side of their upper legs for females, and at the higher side of their upper legs for males, or for some males even at their lower torso. Their bodies below that line are more draconic than humanoid, as is their draconic tail and some other occasional parts of their upper body as well, with males having more scales and hair than females. Female half dragons on the other hand tend to have very little or no body hair, and while they are generally more fierce and assertive than other humanoid females, they also tend to be more feminine and submissive to their male partners. Scholars suspect this is due to their dragon heritage, where the roles of courtship are reversed. Similar to half dragons, there are more female dragons than male dragons, and females often compete or even fight for the right to court a male, to whom she must prove herself to be a desirable mate. However, half dragons are a race with strong individuals, so while most are naturally tended this way, not all are. Both sexes also gain an advantage based on which draconic heritage is more dominant for them."

Others are abandoned by the draconic parent or both parents and forced to survive alone or hope they get adopted by other half dragons or by dragonborn. Though those with a metallic dragon parent are, more often than not, properly raised and cared for. Half dragons who are adopted by dragonborn are brought in as part of the clan and are raised to be loyal to that clan. A continual drive for self-improvement reflects the self-sufficiency of the dragonborn race as a whole, which is then reflected upon the half dragon, who also value skill and excellence in all endeavors. They hate to fail, and they push themselves to extreme efforts before they give up on something.",
							"These dragonborn-raised half dragons hold mastery of a particular skill as a lifetime goal, alongside the desire to ascend to dragonhood. Members of other races who share the same commitment find it easy to earn their respect. Eventually, all half dragons have a universal drive to become stronger. By gaining strength in a multitude of ways, they find that they become more in touch with their draconic heritage, which comes forward in the forms of mastering their elemental breath, or even transforming into a dragon outright. This form is often not as strong as that of true dragons, except for those who are truly devoted and powerful. Such half dragons have \"ascended to dragonhood\", and become true dragons with all their terrifying might. This true dragon form, however, is not easy to attain and requires great devotion and resolve. But those who succeed are held in very high regard by half dragon society."

Usually, however, many half dragons start a family and have children, with the mother being encouraged to take care of the children while the father goes out and provides for his family. Should the mother choose to become an adventurer, then the grandparents or one of the extended family will often take care of the children. While they are relatively few in number, half dragons are rapidly increasing their numbers due to a high fertility rate and big families. Most members of each community often share a similar color, based on one of their dragon ancestors. As such, these communities tend to have characteristics related to that dragon ancestor. For example, many half gold dragons, like their full-blooded kin, actively hunt down evil creatures, and their breath weapon is quite effective against such foes. Half dragon communities are protected by their elders, some of whom have already ascended to dragonhood and make for formidable opponents."

Some might look like normal half dragons, while others could have less draconic traits (such as drow legs) or even more draconic traits; such as a full dragon's head. Their shadow touched nature allows them to change their appearance, enabling them to infiltrate drow society from within. They are also far more likely to develop wings than regular half dragons are, which scholars believe is due to the influences of the Shadowfell instead of a deity. The zekyl are led by their ascended kin, now called drow-dragons, who genuinly care for them as a family. Because of this strong bond, most zekyl have a strong sense of loyalty to the drow-dragons that govern over them. Yet some zekyl follow the deities Vhaeraun and Eilistraee, whom they consider allies against Lolth. While others become adventurers, and seek to leave the Underdark all together."

The stories also tell of how the process failed, as the newly created driders were generally kind hearted, and Lolth let them live as a way to mock the failed attempt. Regardless of what their origins are, they are often viewed with contempt by drow society. Because of this many driders hold contempt for drow and Lolth, or they become zealots that try to redeem themselves before the spider queen, while yet others simply try to get by and use their ability to create spider silk to make beautiful silken clothes.",

The wood's denizens have a tendency of being kind and open minded, compassionate and caring. The corvum stand out, as they are aware of how dangerous and deceitful the outer world truly is. In the past, the Humblewood was threatened by human settlers, people with a vastly different culture. At first things went well, until the humans numbers and greed grew large enough for them to try and take over the woods for themselves. It was only after the corvum turned the humans own numbers against them with the use of necromancy, as well as unorthodox tactics, that they were driven away.",

These monks are known as Weavers, powerful practitioners of arcane magic who blend martial arts and spellcasting to devastating effect. The Weave is a way through which raw magic can be accessed, and used by casters of magic. It flows through the world, and touches all of existence. Weavers specialize in the schools of divination, enchantment, and transmutation magic. Using divination magic to peer into the expansive knowledge of the Weave, enchantment magic to manipulate the minds of the weak willed, and transmutation magic to alter their bodies and the world around them, they are prepared to meet any threat they may face. They are one with the Weave, and the Weave is with them.",

There have since been many branches, most still following the way of righteousness and justice, while others focus more on power and using it to further their own ends. Regardless, most monks of the Way of the Weave still hold strong connections with their Dragonsinger brethren, and often band together to achieve a common goal. These monks are also known as Silver Knights, to honor the half silver dragons that founded their order.",

But sometimes the color is influenced by the type of enchantment on the shortsword or longsword that was transformed into an arcane saber.",

				"The Dragon Student is an unusual patron, as you are the one teaching it. Your power comes from your dragon student, but it is you who helps it harness this awesome power. Technically this power comes from Io, the dragon primordial of creation, who gifted this power as an otherworldly patron. But it's your dragon student who grants it to you directly. This is why you are more warlock than wizard. You are a Dragon Master, a student of the Darastrix Academy.",
				"At a young age you were bonded with a dragon wyrmling, entrusted to you by its dragon parents. Even though you are a student, you are a master in your own right to your dragon wyrmling, as you teach it to harness its power. Due to the bonding, your wyrmling shares your drive to learn its dragon magic quickly, at the cost of other aspects of its draconic might being weakened. Although you are technically a wizard, the bond that you have made with your dragon has granted you access to its dragon magic, but in exchange your own studies towards the arcane have been limited.",
				"However, the ability to delve into the secrets of dragon magic more than makes up for that. Now you and your dragon partner go out on adventures, as you seek to put the power of dragon magic into practice. Most Dragon Masters are human, but half dragons have been known to teach siblings. Brown, celestial, deep, fang, gem, gray, moonstone, song, and steel dragons don't send their young to become dragon students, due to their secretive nature. Your magical bond with your dragon companion grants you access to its powerful dragon magic in addition to your own mortal magic.",
				"For example, a {@spell bigby's hand|PHB} would look like a fist when cast by a humanoid, and as a flaming claw when cast by its red dragon student. And even though you still need to study, most of your magical power comes from this bond. As such, Dragon Masters have a saying when it comes to their dragons: You teach me and I teach you.",
