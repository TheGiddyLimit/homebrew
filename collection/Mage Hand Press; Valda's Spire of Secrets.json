						"You can use an action to tie a rope to the end of a harpoon before it is thrown. If a rope-tied harpoon hits a target, it becomes embedded in the target, and you can use an action on subsequent turns to hold fast to the rope and make an opposed Strength (Athletics) check against the target to pull it up to 10 feet closer to you. Additionally, when the target moves, you can use your reaction to make an opposed Strength (Athletics) check against it, preventing its movement on a success. If you use your action to do anything else, you lose your grip on the rope. If the target has hands, it can remove the harpoon as an action."
