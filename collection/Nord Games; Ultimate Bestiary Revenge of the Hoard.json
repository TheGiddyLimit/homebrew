The infected creature suffers one level of {@condition exhaustion}, has disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks, and requires twice the usual amount of water each day. At the end of each long rest, the infected creature must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw against the disease. A successful save decreases its level of {@condition exhaustion} by one.

After one failed save, the creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw whenever it is placed in a stressful situation or spend its turn making a melee attack against the nearest creature, moving up to its speed if necessary. The DC for this saving throw increases by 2 for each level of {@condition exhaustion} above 1.
