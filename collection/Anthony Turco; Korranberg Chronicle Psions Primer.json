The people of Khalesh were righteous and just\u2014at least, according to them\u2014and channeled holy power to crusade against the evils of their time. Sages of the Library of Korranberg have identified Khalesh's ancient religion as a \"serpent cult,\" worshiping the celestial couatl and venerating their fight against the demonic forces of Khyber. Unbeknown to Khalesh's greater population, however, the champions and nobles of their society were infused with the essence of couatls themselves, becoming the shulassakar, whose bloodlines were bestowed with several traits associated with their serpentine idols\u2014some more noticeable than others. Among the more subtle of these traits was the innate psionic power that the couatls themselves possessed.",

Typically these shulassakar have no contact with others of their kind and repel all intruders. The shulassakar can be coldly ruthless in their opposition to evil.

The transcendent form is considered the final, \"true\" form of the shulassakar, embodying the full blessing of the couatl\u2014invested with all of the couatls' holiness after the shulassakar has gone through countless purifying reincarnations. Though they are dedicated mind, body, and soul to the forces of good, shulassakar transcendent also suffer from the hubris and arrogance typical of mortals raised to believe they are some sort of superior lifeform.

											"The unbodied are a fable to the people of Adar, the mountainous region of southern Sarlona known for its refugees and monastic adepts. It is whispered among the Adarans that the unbodied are the cursed monks of an ancient monastery that existed long before the kalashtar and Inspired came to Sarlona. The mystic leaders of this monastery guided the others in a meditation to manifest a communal psionic power unknown to modern day psions and mystics, one that promised all who participated in it true enlightenment. When the ritual was completed, the monks indeed cast off their mortal bodies, but rather than transcending to a higher realm of existence, their consciousnesses became mired in the physical realm. Divested of their mortal bodies, but not their mortal wants and needs, they now wander aimlessly, unable to attain the enlightenment they desired."

To these contrarians, the unbodied are not evidence of a failed ritual, but rather a sign of its success. The monks who transcended divested themselves not only of their physical bodies, but also their desires. These desires now float, independent and bodiless, on their own. The higher consciousnesses of those ancient monks, thus free of all desire, were able to transcend mortal existence. To proponents of this version of the tale, the ancient psionic ritual of the unbodied remains the promise of true enlightenment, and they seek the location of the time-lost monastery in which the psionic ritual was manifested for clues on how to reenact it."

She leaned forward, resting her elbow on the table, and with a flash of light from her eyes and chest, a blade of radiant blue energy appeared around her hand. \"Will this qualify?\"}",

						"{@i \"Would you need more evidence that what I am here to tell you is not of your arcanism?\" Evatana dismissed her blade as Rhen debated whether another drink was worth trying to get the bartender's attention. \"Very few of my people would even consider offering an outsider any of this information at all.\"}",
						"{@i Glancing over to the corner where Ardiane had settled herself to watch the meeting, Rhen nodded in acknowledgement, then flagged down the bartender for another mug of ale, deciding he did, in fact, need something to help him take this all in. \"Then why now and why me?\" He could feel Ardiane's eyes burning the back of his skull, despite her being several feet away and possessed of no such magical gaze abilities. He knew she was carefully watching for any trickery on Evatana's part.}",
						"{@i A growl from another section of the tavern drew his attention in that direction, but he didn't miss Evatana's next words. \"I believe that the people of these lands can be made allies rather than left as ignorant lambs before the onslaught of the Darkness.\"}",
						"{@i She followed his gaze as well, where a Jorash'tar half-orc from the Mror Holds had drawn the attention of a Lhazaarite pirate who'd gotten too close. The Mror lowlander lifted the offender off the ground, growling in his face. The pirate's friends came to his defense, and soon the area around the bar was a flurry of splinters and punches. \"This is what they will do,\" Evatana gestured broadly at the room, \"but on a grander scale. They will divide your people, let them fight themselves, and when you are weak, they will come as saviors.\"}",
						"{@i Rhen paused, looking suspiciously at the woman, then gestured to the bar brawl. \"This isn't your influence, is it?\" Evatana shook her head, both in answer and, apparently, to warn off Ardiane. \"So these quori are just waiting for us to destroy ourselves in some sort of apocalyptic war...\" A chill ran down his spine, and he put his head in his hands.}",
						"{@i Evatana gave him a moment, in which Ardiane abandoned all subtlety to sit next to him, glaring at Evatana suspiciously as she put an arm around his waist. \"Yes,\" Evatana replied. \"Whether or not they had a hand in its beginning, you were never so vulnerable as you are now. Certainly, their hidden hands seek to renew the destruction of the Last War.\"}",
						"{@i \"And I just happen to be in the right place for you to pass this message on?\" Rhen looked up, taking a deep gulp from the new mug. \"They're eating at the fractures, and these 'psionic powers' are what they're using to do it.\" He coughed as the unexpectedly strong Lhazaar alcohol burned the back of his throat. How strong was the ale here? \"Then you're right. Tell me about the quori and how we can fight their designs. I don't know if we can, but...\"}",
						"{@i Evatana offered a small smile. \"Your people fight horrors like this all the time. Psionic powers are not as foreign to Khorvaire as you think. Beneath the surface of this land, the mind flayers and their aberrant kin know these techniques too, and despite the taint of this psionic corruption spreading through cults and warped bloodlines, your protectors in the forests fought them and won.
