						"Like many gamers out there, we have been overfl owing with creativity since an early age. Creative writing, poetry, art and music have always played a large role in our lives, but it was during our teenage years that all of those talents and passions were ignited into a fi re storm of excitement when we sat down for our fi rst session of Dungeons & Dragons. Although we didn't know it at the time, that fi rst game would be a life changing experience. For almost two decades now we've been creating characters and going on fantastic adventures, each more exciting than the last!",
						"When the latest version of D&D hit the shelves, we were eager to try it out. We had been part of the beta testing process and saw many new and interesting rules enter the scene. We enjoyed the Starter Set, and we picked up each of the core rule books as soon as they were available. For a year we've been meeting weekly, and sometimes daily, for game sessions where we've explored perilous dungeons, faced insurmountable hordes, fought deadly foes, and conquered monstrous beasts. We've lost a few party members along the way, but their names will be remembered as we reminisce for years to come about the epic adventures we all had together.",
						"This very topic got all of us thinking. How can we help the gaming community, both Game Masters and Players, to get the most out of their gaming experience? Th e question wasn't easy to answer. Th ere is already so much excellent content out there, what would gamers really need that doesn't already exist? ",
						"The answer came quite naturally one night during a game session when our Game Master was going a bit off  script and needed an unplanned NPC to interact with the Players. It took him longer than usual to create the NPC from what he had to work with, and aft er a few rolls he had enough, but not much more than that. Th ere was no backstory, no real personality beyond the stereotype based on race and gender.",
						"We instantly saw a need for a resource book that didn't exist yet: a book populated by NPCs that had more to them than just a name, race and class. A book that could be used by a Game Master to populate a tavern, or a trading post, or a banquet hall. Alternatively, the book could be used by Players to create starting characters, or to spy out character progression, or to create characters at later levels if they come late to the adventure and the rest of the Players' characters have already leveled up a few times.",
						"We brainstormed and collaborated, seeing our quest unfold before us. It would not be an easy task, but nothing worth doing ever is. We all know that; our years of role playing games have proven it time and time again. You can't just stroll in and slay the dragon, it takes planning, preparation, talent, and teamwork to accomplish the hardest quests. So that's what we've done."

								"Their intention was to quickly spread news across the realm to the benefi t of all but, as is all too common, their power was soon turned to darker purposes. The king used The Ravens as a platform to spread propaganda and condemn those groups who opposed or spoke ill of him.",
								"The Raven leaders who did not agree to spread the king's messages were jailed, and the remaining scribes, forced to write falsities, conspired together. The remaining elders among them, meanwhile, decided to leave the service of the king and instead live a life of seclusion and secrecy. No longer would they live in the lap of luxury within the palace. Th eir dedication to the spreading of truth and knowledge led to a collective agreement to abandon the lap of luxury in the dead of night.",

								"The Red Gloves have a long and sordid history. Originally they were an aristocratic group lead by a man called Hammonder Strattenbury, a wealthy land owner in the realm. He and his constituents were oft en invited to fancy gatherings reserved for nobility and the landed gentry. Th e reason was simple: he controlled vast tracts of land excellent for farming and, although not everyone needs a fancy palace with a view overlooking a valley, everyone does need to eat. This made Hammonder very powerful in times of plenty, and even more so in times of need.",
								"The Red Gloves remained a welcome addition to any social gathering of the upper class for many decades but little did they know there was a vagabond in their midst",
								"Tatan of the house Freely, as he named himself when fi rst introduced to Hammonder, was an imposter. He was not of a noble house, as he claimed to be, nor indeed did he have any wealth to speak of. He was, in fact, a thief. He had traveled the realm, never staying in a village, town, or city long enough to get comfortable. Th is time, however, he saw the chance to tip the scales in the favor of those less fortunate.",
								"He quickly gained the favor of Hammonder, representing himself as a man with a long history concerning trade and commerce. After many years of improving business from the farms, he proposed to Hammonder that he handle more of the business arrangements. By this time, the old man was living comfortably in his retirement and felt there was no one more suited to the task. Promptly agreeing, he spent the rest of his years enjoying his wealth and attending lavish gatherings with the realm's elite until his death at a well-earned, but untimely, age of sixty three. With Hammonder having no heirs to lay claim to the land or the vast wealth he had accumulated, Tatan found himself in a hard place. Th e law of the land stated that the property of an heirless lord, in absense of a will, would become the property of the crown. Tatan and other friends of the old man had searched through his belongings for such a document, but to no avail.",
								"Digging through his connections to underground networks of thieves and criminals, Tatan sought the aid of The Quills (p.68), a tight-lipped guild of forgers who artfully produce any document that need requires, if the requester is willing to pay the price... Just two days before the king was to lay claim on the property of Hammonder, a will was unexpectantly discovered in his most personal eff ects declaring Tatan and four other members of Th e Red Gloves benefi ciaries of his vast estate. Th e wealth was divided evenly between the fi ve and, so great a compensation was just one fi ft h of his wealth, the other four kept to themselves any grievance that Tatan appeared to have been given the entirety of Hammonder's land. Tatan was quickly named Lord and took up residence in the Lord's House in which Hammonder had lived.",
								"Even today, members of Th e Red Gloves consist of former criminals of one ilk or another. They use their power to subtly sway the pendulum of politics in their favor, with a philosophy that life is but a play and we are all actors in it. We each have much to gain if we play the right part."

				"Legends say that Vazim Tell'ani was a vicious warlord from the Far East. He ruled a nomadic people centuries ago who made war with many kingdoms. On his 50th birthday he was betrayed by his lover, drugged, and sold to a brutal and unforgiving king who had him burned alive on the top of a high dune for all to see. Many days passed as word reached his sons of his death. They rode many days and many nights to the high dune and, once there, gathered what they could of their father's ashes. They swore revenge on all kingdoms in the realm and took the ashes, gathering them in a copper urn. Vabrum, Vasim's eldest son, commissioned the smithing of a new sword which he would use to remove the head of every king who had conspired against his father. He instructed the smith to mix his father's ashes into the coal he would use to smelt the ore, thereby imbuing the blade with the very soul of Vasim himself. Th e blade remained an heirloom of the Tell'ani brothers and their decedents until well after it had fulfilled Vabrum's curse on the kings. After that, the blade mysteriously went missing, but has been claimed to exist mounted on the wall of countless armories throughout the realms."

				"You shout the word \"Donnybrook\" in the common tongue into a crowd or group of at least 15 targets. The DM assigns a number on the {@dice d100} at which the spell will be unsuccessful, taking into consideration the average Wisdom of the targets. For example, a tavern full of brigands and ruffians may have only a 10% chance of failing, while a group of nobles at a fancy dinner party may have a 90% chance of failing. If successful, the spell causes all of the targets to immediately attack the closest target to them with whatever non-weapon item they have available. Th ese items include tankards, plates, chairs, stools, etc. Th e spell lasts for up to one minute, or until most of the targets are unconscious save one, standing confused amidst a pile of stricken bodies. The caster is unable to revoke the spell's effects before it has run its course."

					"Thief Slayer It had been nearly two months of hard work: freezing nights on rooft ops and up to his knees in fi lth in the sewers, but it had all been worth it. Th e information he had gathered\u2014watch schedules, rivalries, fears\u2014meant his plan went off  without a hitch. Aft er tonight, Th e Vipers would never take out another bounty on him. Last night was hard, but by sunrise twelve of the highest ranking members of the group lay dead. Aelar had used their own techniques against them, making it look like old rivalries had fl ared, or treacherous deals had been made. Come the morning the bodies were discovered, and the entire gang dissolved into infi ghting factions. Th ose that weren't killed were now in chains and would doubtless face the hangman. Now there were just a few loose ends to clear up. Th ree loose ends to be precise, limping their way through the woods a few miles out from the city: the chief and his last two remaining loyal men.",
					"Aelar had been close on their trail throughout the evening and, now that they had stopped to make camp, he had his opportunity. Th e chief had taken the fi rst watch, staring slumped into the campfi re. Aelar nocked an arrow and drew back the string but, just as he leveled his aim, the chief's face hardened with a sudden resolve. Slowly, he got to his feet, a fl ash of fi re at his belt as his knife left  its sheath. Aelar held his breath, but he was seemingly not the chief's target. Instead, he moved towards his sleeping men, clearly meaning to put to rest any suspicion in his mind that they would turn on him as the others had.",
					"Aelar loosed the arrow; the chief grunted as it pierced his chest, and he sank to his knees. Th e two men awoke, startled, and reached for their weapons but two arrows piercing their wrists put a stop to such thoughts. Th e chief toppled forwards snapping a smoldering log and sending embers fl ying, and the men surrendered.",
					"Aelar left  them tied to a tree by the city's main gate, and ordered them to call for help, \"and when it comes,\" he told them, \"you shall confess your crimes and lead the guard to your camp.",
					"As he disappeared into the night, he had a sudden thought.  \"And tell them Th e Th ief Slayer sent you.\" ",

					"Overview ",
					"Cogrin's father taught him the art of swordplay from an early age, imparting all of his own knowledge to his son. On his sixteenth birthday, he was given a masterfully craft ed greatsword which his father had spent weeks forging, balancing, sharpening, and polishing. It was a thing to behold, and he was grateful. Cogrin's people were natural warriors, but only ever meant to defend what was theirs; their land and their families.",
					"The village lived in relative peace for many years until one day, when Cogrin and his uncle were hunting in the forest for deer and small game, they spied a troop of half a dozen vagabonds, scurrying through the forest with a common purpose: a scouting party, his uncle thought. Th ey were headed toward Cogrin's village, each of them heavily armed and ready for battle.",
					"Cogrin and his uncle intercepted the group and slew every one of them, by bow and by sword. It was the first time his blade had tasted human blood. When they returned to their village they found it ablaze. Their families were either slain or taken, along with anything valuable. Cogrin found his father's body near his forge, pierced with many arrows and laying in a circle of slain foes. His sword was missing, as was Cogrin's mother. ",
					"Personality Traits ",
					"\"Talk is cheap.\" Cogrin judges people by their actions, not their words. He has little patience for folk who speak too much, or refuse to pay other folk proper respect. He does not hide his emotions, expressing his thoughts and feelings without care for who he might off end. ",
					"Ideals ",
					"\"We are all born free.\" He values freedom above all other things in life. Tyrants must not be allowed to oppress people, he will gladly be part of any plan that involves disrupting their schemes. ",
					"Bonds ",
					"\"I will find her. One day.\" He is constantly on the move, searching for any sign of his mother and the villains who took her. He has a deeply ingrained desire to protect those who cannot protect themselves.",
					"Flaws",
					"\"I'll tell you when I've had enough!\" He has a weakness for vices of the city, especially hard drink and easy women. He's been the instigator in more than a few tavern brawls. He uses his great size to intimidate people more oft en than he should, and oft en regrets his actions in retrospect.",
					"Roleplaying Cogrin",
					"Cogrin has two very diff erent personalities. Around men, he is gruff  and quick to accept, or issue, a challenge. He will speak his mind, even going so far as to put another man's reputation and honor into question publicly. Around women, he is respectful and chivalrous. A gentle hulk, whose reputation among the fairer sex may actually be more wide spread than it is among men who either fear or admire him.",
					"He is not above stealing what he needs to survive and rarely has any money to pay for goods and services. He has been known to sneak into a hayloft  for a good night's rest if he can't fi nd a free room in the local inn.",
					"In combat, Cogrin will not back down to insurmountable odds, believing that he will be victorious over evil no matter what. He prefers to meet his enemies head on, but his experience in battle prevents him from passing up an attack of opportunity.",

She sees any attack on her employer's interests as a personal slight, and any long term plans are put on hold to systematically and brutally tear apart the lives of those responsible.  ",

					"Once a hunter and trapper selling furs and game, Mal began his criminal career by accident\u2014he was falsely accused of murder shortly after entering a foreign city. While awaiting his turn at the gallows, he shared a jail cell with two members of a local thieves guild. Although they spoke the common tongue to him, they spoke to one another in a strange language. The night before they were to be executed, Mal was suddenly roused from sleep. His cell mates were conspiring. When they noticed he was awake they motioned for him to stay silent. They spoke in whispers, \"How much do you want to live?\" ",
					"Mal became suddenly frightened, thinking these thieves meant to slit his throat. He was, however, mistaken. Th ey explained that their guild brothers would be unlocking their cell shortly, and, if he so desired, he could go free as well. He was skeptical but desperate. Sure enough, minutes later, the light from a guard's oil lamp came through the small barred window in the cell door. A hushed voice echoed in the chamber just outside and one of the thieves in Mal's cell answered. Th e key in the lock chattered. It was now or never and Mal's cell mates didn't waste time.",
					"On the floor just outside his cell door there sat an oil lamp and a key ring. Mal knelt down to take them, but when he looked up again, the thieves were gone. He was on his own. ",
					"He crept slowly, but not very quietly, through the network of hallways and passages for several tense minutes, trying to recall the exact route that he was brought days earlier. It was hard to remember as he had been badly beaten by the city guard during his arrest, then again as he was brought to the prison and questioned. He thought about slitting the throats of every guard he might meet but, surprisingly, there were none on patrol. The thieves and their guild mates' work, he thought. ",
					"Suddenly he rounded a corner, and there was the flickering of fi relight. He crept closer as quietly as he could, discovering one of many guard rooms. In it were several guards lying in bunks, or sitting around a fire in the middle of the room, but there was no sound besides the crackling of the dwindling fire. Mal approached cautiously to find that all of the guards had been slain with a single slice to the throat. ",
					"He quickly ransacked the room, taking any coin he could lay his hands on, along with arms and armor. He left the oil lamp but kept the keys, exiting the large door to the north. Finding himself in the moonlight of the early morning, he took a deep breath of free air. Having been spat on by the world for attempting an honest living, Mal turned his back on his old life and vowed to bring down the system of \"justice\" which allowed him to be jailed.",

					"Always fascinated, always reading, always learning; Nimh was forever asking questions, fi nding out how and why things worked, even as a child. Th e arthritic dog of a neighbor mysteriously disappeared one day and was found cut into neat pieces in the temple grounds next to Nimh's house. She had just wanted to know why it was broken and if it could be fi xed. Th e fi nal straw came as a teenager, when she 'fi xed' the pneumonia of the farmer's prize sheep by transplanting into it the lungs of his carthorse. Th e townsfolk hid their children and animals as she made her way to the road. ",
					"She moved to a town where nobody knew of her peculiarities and trained as an apothecary, keeping her unusual 'hobbies' to herself. Her intensive study turned her into an accomplished alchemist; observing the eff ects of elixirs on living things mesmerized her. Not satisfi ed with simply viewing their external eff ects, waifs and strays both human and animal oft en found themselves invited in out of the cold, then strapped to a table in her tiny backroom, fl esh and muscle neatly clipped back to reveal their inner workings. If they were lucky, Nimh would let them die fi rst.",
					"Completely ruthless and clinical, she had no reservations whatsoever when mortal representatives of the Demon Lord of the Affl  icted appeared to her and off ered her knowledge beyond measure in exchange for what's left  of those who perish on her table. To increase her body count, she now moonlights as a backstreet surgeon, mostly for the less savory characters of the town, and can easily be persuaded to facilitate a 'tragic complication' if her patron would prefer the patient not make a full recovery. Aft er all, the necromancers get what they want and Nimh can start a new 'side-project'... ",

					"Flaws ",
					"\"People get in the way of my research. I'm better off  without them.\" Nimh's only tie is to her work. She recognizes that her methods are unusual and, even if it weren't, having assistants would only mean having to say her thoughts out loud, slowing the whole process down. ",
					"Roleplaying Nimh ",
					"Nimh is driven solely by the pursuit of knowledge and has no sentiment, no empathy and no moral compass; animals and humans are meat. Although not a natural combatant, she would not hesitate to kill to protect or further her research. However, while worth killing for, her research is not worth dying for. Naturally charismatic when it suits her, such as when persuading lowlifes in off  the street, she is generally solitary and quiet, believing interaction with others to be unnecessary, time-consuming and beneath her.

					"Stanus once had aspirations of being a famous musician, traveling from town to town, making people smile and laugh. It didn't take long for the cruel reality of life to take advantage of a young and naive Stanus. Discovering that bards just starting out are not unquestioningly invited to play at court to those of quality, he resorted to playing for coppers in disgusting taverns and outside inns. He didn't even make enough to rent a room, and oft en slept in dirty allyways and under eaves. Despite his poor lodgings, he maintained his dignity with fi ne clothes and a fantastic hat. ",
					"Late one night, he was playing his lute outside of a tavern in the dim lamp light. His hat, with a handful of coppers and a few silvers, was upturned on a stool in front of him. Unbeknownst to him, he had attracted the attention of a few ruffi  ans who falsely assumed that such a well-dressed fellow would have more than a his fair share of coins and other valuables. They waited until the streets were fairly clear before making their move. ",
					"One of the three ruffi  ans approached casually, bobbing his head to the music before dropping a copper into the hat. Stanus bowed his head to him as he continued to play. That's when the other two ruffians snuck up from either side. He was grabbed and pushed up against the tavern wall. One ruffian quickly grabbed the hat and ran. The other two began to turn out his pockets. He struggled until a swift  punch to the stomach doubled him over. One of them ripped the lute from his hands, breaking the shoulder strap. The other one found his coin purse, \"Where is the rest?!\" He demanded. Another punch to the stomach. ",
					"At that moment, a tall figure opened the tavern door and staggered out. He looked over at the three of them and said, \"Let him go.\" The ruffians chuckled. The figure stepped closer, Stanus looked up to see a dapper sailor with tanned skin and long dark hair. \"He may not be the best musician, but what he lacks in talent he makes up for in determination.\" ",
					"The ruffian who had taken the lute approached, intending to use it as a club. Without a second thought, the man drew a pistol concealed under his jacket and fi red, killing him. The other thief began to run, so the man drew another pistol, took aim, and fired. He fell with a grunt. The stranger looked down at Stanus, \"Care to join me for an ale?\" ",
					"Stanus was shocked and surprised. He had no idea who he had just met, or how this man would change his life, and his views, forever. ",
