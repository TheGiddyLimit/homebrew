But one stands high above the rest: the Hands of Vecna, a covert interplanar organization that uses the magical secrets and artifacts they've amassed to defend the mortal worlds against the horrific elder evils that threatens to tear them apart.",

It is for this reason that He works tirelessly to thwart their efforts.",
										"In fact, Vecna is the {@i only} deity who truly understands what is at stake here. The gods of the Lower Planes wage petty wars and lack foresight and long-term planning, and those of the Upper Planes are arrogant, naive, and myopic to the greater universe around them. At the end of the day, mortals are simply livestock to them, the Material Plane but a playpen for them to create more worshipers and petitioners. Only Vecna, a human wizard turned wandering god of secrets, can see the bigger picture. It is up to us mortals to defend ourselves against the countless horrors lurking beyond the stars\u2014no matter the cost. And with His help, we might just have a fighting chance.",
										"To do this, we need to spread our roots far and wide. Remain ever unseen, and seek out as much knowledge and power as you can. Wielding power without comprehension is worthless\u2014those who do so are not deserving of it. No, the occult magic that the forces of \"good\" would gatekeep from the world are the only way we can ensure our survival - we must take it for ourselves, study it, and weaponize it against these alien threats as best we can.",
										"We deal with rabid cults, alien artifacts, and profane rituals; more specifically, we root them out and neutralize the threat they pose, all while staying out of public view. With misguided servants of light looking to stamp out anything even remotely related to the Maimed God, and omnicidal cultists itching to destroy anyone who opposes the \"higher powers\" that they serve, secrecy and discretion are of absolute importance."

														"\"In today's Hermeneutics session, we shall analyze the Vecnan teachings of the lich Mauthereign, their failings and shortcomings, and the lessons we can extract from them.",
														"In The Scroll of Mauthereign, a dogmatic and idealistic version of Vecna's past is presented to his followers. It claims that Vecna was a being of pure benevolence, a victim of envious usurpers who sought to claim His secrets for themselves. Following this is a call for action, a plea to embrace villainy in His name\u2014supposedly, His enemies have 'forced' our hand, giving us no choice but to commit despicable acts as a reflection of their own evil.",
														"While I am always one to preach tolerance and respect, especially for fellow worshipers of The Whispered One, make no mistake\u2014this organization does not associate with these extremists in any capacity.",
														"Mauthereign's fallacy is simple: he still ascribes to the outdated notions of 'evil' and 'good'. In his twisted mind, he {@b must} be good, because to be good is to be in the right, and his enemies must be evil and thus in the wrong.",
														"But Hands of Vecna do not adhere to this limited worldview. Deities of the Upper Planes have abandoned their followers time and time again\u2014is that not an act of evil? Are we to fall to our knees and praise the baatezu for waging their endless Blood War against the tanar'ri, preventing them from spilling forth into the Material Plane? While these questions are complex and could justify several sessions of their own, do understand that these are but countless examples of the asynchronity between morality as a philosophical construction and as a cosmic force.",
														"I will be blunt\u2014Vecna is indeed what some philosophers would claim to be 'evil'. But is He in the wrong? Not in the slightest. Vecna is not the 'god of evil secrets', for secrets lack the capacity for morality. For good or for ill, secrets are the lifeblood of the Planes, and Vecna claims dominion over all of them. While madmen like Mauthereign may use His secrets to lay waste to the worlds, we use them to {@b defend} the worlds from the machinations of the horrors that lurk just beyond the boundary of what we call 'reality'.",
														"Mauthereign's failings mirror those of the gods themselves. As timeless embodiments of concepts and ideals, they lack the ability to see beyond themselves. With few exceptions, they are slaves to their nature, and their impression on the Planes is only a facsimile of consciousness, a superficial imitation of the mortals they claim to rule over.",
														"In a time long past, Vecna was in fact a mortal, just like you and I. He understood happiness, and despair, and curiosity, and grief, and even love. And even now that He is a deity, Vecna tirelessly wanders the Planes, constantly searching for forgotten secrets and fragments of forbidden knowledge that may He may claim for Himself. And He understands that there are threats beyond mortalkind's comprehension, that in the face of the true horrors beyond the stars, the wars waged by the gods are nothing more than petty squabbles.",
														"So, does Vecna perform evil acts in search of this knowledge? Of course. But with the fruits of labor, He attains a wonderful boon that no other deity can even hope to understand\u2014the ability to {@b change}. Just like us, Vecna is ever evolving, constantly expanding his understanding of the Planes, of mortalkind, and of Himself.",
														"{@i That}, my friends, is the lesson Vecna wishes to impart upon us. Only in the search for knowledge and power can true metamorphosis be achieved. And until the mortal worlds can understand this and finally reach salvation, it is up to us to defend them, to hide in the shadows and fight the battles they cannot. Because if we don't, if we allow even a single elder evil to claim victory over us, then everything mortalkind has accomplished will have been for naught.",
														"And thus, we return to the Scroll of Mauthereign in search of any fragments of this simple truth that he may have accidentally uncovered. In particular, his commentary on the failings of the gods are particularly well-spoken. One sentence in an otherwise inflammatory passage managed to catches my eye: {@i 'Now, these immortal swine have renewed their reign of oppression, crushing the spirits of the people under the heel of repugnancy and false religions.'}",
														"It is our responsibility to not fall victim to the same fallacies as Mauthereign and his followers, to twist The Whispered One's message to fit our own agenda. For it is only through {@b truth} that we have any chance to succeed.",
														"Thus, I conclude my portion of this session with one more quote from Mauthereign: {@i 'The time for benevolent demonstration is over. Vecna's legacy demands true rebellion.'} We must rebel against our true nature, against the lies of 'fate' and 'destiny', against the seemingly inevitable forces of entropy and destruction that threaten to annihilate all that which we hold near and dear to our hearts. It is only through such rebellion that we can enact Vecna's true will and bring about our salvation.",

In exchange, Pazuzu may require a creature to swear utter obedience for a week or more\u2014and takes full advantage of this service. Over time, even the most innocent servants of Good will find that they have been corrupted into bitter, cruel souls that sow discord and destruction wherever they go.",

										"One possibility is that Vecna uncovered a terrible secret about Pazuzu: he was the one who corrupted the angel Asmodeus, who now rules the Nine Hells, and has a secret alliance with him to find the Shard of Evil that lies at the bottom of the Abyss. In retaliation, by acting as The Benefactor of the Splinter Cell, and perhaps with the assistance of the cerebriliths described earlier in this chapter, he hopes to destroy Vecna's most powerful servants and seize the power of The Beholding for himself. In this scenario, Pazuzu serves as a secret villain to be discovered by the party when they join the Splinter Cell and thwarted before he can do any significant harm.",
										"Alternatively, perhaps Pazuzu is simply a bystander in the war between the Hands and the anomalous, and seeks personal gratification by corrupting the organization's few innocent members towards evil. In this scenario, Pazuzu can serve as a beneficial patron even if the party does discover his true nature\u2014as long as he gets what he wants in the end.",

Furthermore, if it is not deactivated or claimed, Vecna will send His loyal servants (and maybe even an avatar) to seize control over The Panopticon once more.",

Depending on their choices, remnants of the Hands of Vecna may end up allying with the party in this battle without any strings attached.",
									"With many of the campaign's narrative threads finally complete and a multitude of allies and upgrades being acquired along the way, defeating The Overseer should hopefully yield a great payoff that makes the party's diversion from their main goal truly worth their while. And while not having any impact on the cosmology of the setting, the party's actions may have a significant impact on future campaigns, the threats that emerge during them, and the daring heroes or conniving villains that rise up to challenge them."

Absorbing the Far Realm's energy only serves to expand its influence throughout the planes\u2014instead, she should be absorbing mortals with potent mental facilities, as well as the bodies of other shardminds whose crystalline mass can be added to her own. Blending elements of the Shard Slayer philosophy with her existing approach, Synarrah proclaimed that she must become the new Living Gate by force.",
