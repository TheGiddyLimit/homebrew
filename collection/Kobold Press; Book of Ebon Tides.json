The hymns praising Hecate in every one of her temples in the Shadow Realm refer to her as She Who Steadied the Tides, and she is indeed the maker and founder of inhabitation of the plane. To make room for her followers among the fey and humans, she conjured white birch groves, tall red pines on the hills, and moon stones. The waters she diverted into gentle ponds and deep lakes to reflect her glory.",
										"When it was to her liking, she shared the place with her most dutiful followers among the goblins, shadow fey, some exiles from the elf lands, and then the bearfolk and a few night-loving humans. Over time, more and more of the land became solid. All around its shores, even now, the shadow has no end, a roiling ocean of raw chaos and deepest night, leavened with moonlight.",

To bind it, I command a priest to invoke the blessing of Hecate and the Road Gods, calling down the deep roots of the moon.

The two moons provide enough light for the realm's rather pale, thin crops and trees to grow, and both have linked phases. When Celene is full, so is Lindar, and when Lindar is new, so is Celene.",

The constellations familiar to umbral peoples are the Dragon, the North Arrow, the Leaping Salmon, the Swan, the Hunter, and the Greater and Lesser Fox.",

Shadow fey nobles capture and tend flocks of steel-winged eala, and the corrupted, unicorn-like shadhavar wander the woods and race across the plains.

Shadow landmarks and natural anchors perform the same function, and as elements of the plane, they do not require arcane power to create. Instead, these features of the land are notable as geographic features: white cliffs, enormous house-sized boulders out on the plains, a beach of pure white sand, a set of purple dunes, or a particularly stunning mountain peak or outcropping.",

Most are associated with names, legends, or associated figures from history. The older and more visited the site, the more resistant it becomes to damage by black water, harsh radiance, or similar natural effects. Natives of the plane call them \"natural anchors,\" places too distinctive to be washed away or to sink silently beneath other terrain."

A new court, for instance, might take a \"properly modest\" name such as Lilypad Manor, the Court of Cherries, or the Court of Three Bridges, ruled by a lord, lady, or keeper. In time, the court might grow and become the Court of Ruby Blossoms or the Court of the Silent River, ruled by a princess, marquess, or count. Such names can be proposed yet fail to become accepted by the members of the court if a ruler judges their own advancement too generously.

The court's position at a planar nexus means that outside forces both strengthen it (when they seek to trade and pay handsomely for goods from far afield) and undermine it (when they seek to seize its position for themselves).",

Archery is a popular pastime, and the court bowyer, Vilhopelli, produces astonishing, sometimes-enchanted bows, arrows, and fletching, using materials from the Golden Oak. However, Vilhopelli always demands great favors or other magical items in exchange\u2014his sobriquet, \"the Generous,\" a bit of an insult as he is notoriously tight-fisted.",

As is tradition in many elven courts, Queen Valda declares the contests, called the Tournaments of Oak and Ash, when the season seems right. She invites all comers to the court to prove their ability as archers, as knights, or as wizards. Sometimes these include particular tests such as jousts, melees, target shooting, shooting on the wing, battle magic, counterspell duels, feats of horsemanship, drawing shadow power, or tilting at a golden ring. At other times, she may include a test of poetry or dancing, merely to show that not all a knight's prowess comes from strength of arms. The contests are the ones the queen declares, and the winners are given prizes and win renown both at the court itself and among other elves, shadow fey, gnomes, and the like."

They bring these souls to the headwaters of the Nightbrook, and in a dark ritual that requires a memory philter (see {@book Chapter 10|BookOfEbonTides|10|Memory Philters}) holding emotions of loss, longing, rage, or bitterness, they twist the souls into hungry shades. Once infused with those hollow emotions, the ladies pour the souls out of their soul bags into the river to join the others.

Rows of great, curving horns jut from the tower's surface, giving it a wicked, serrated silhouette. Beneath these foreboding trophies, shadow-mined gold bands the stone.

Shadow drakes have long lived and died in these caverns, and they maintain a loose, tenuous alliance with the fey occupying the tower. In exchange for the drakes' defense of the tower and occasional service as messengers or mounts to the high-ranking knights, the shadow fey have given the drakes leave to hunt in the surrounding lands. Most important, the shadow fey mine the tunnels for the elusive shadow gold veins that run through them. The drakes take a generous share of the yield.",
								"Shadow gold is in many ways the same as the gold mined in mortal lands, but it holds the essence of shadow within it. Most of the goblins here mine and smelt the metal without pause or holiday, for the shadow fey and drakes require it (while the others maintain the tower and prepare the food, clothes, and tools for the goblin miners and fey knights). In its raw form, shadow gold appears as a mottled mix of gold and black. When the metal is cast or forged and then polished, its color and luster become indistinguishable from normal gold. Only when the metal is molten, nicked, bent, or scratched is its true nature revealed. Any damage to the metal shows the shadow within.",
								"The shadow fey mint coins of shadow gold and trade it generously to mortals in payment or bribery. It is said that with each shadow gold coin one accepts from the fey, one loses a bit more of one's will and soul to them. Greed remains a powerful force, and shadow fey diplomats, emissaries, and spies liberally buy whatever and whoever they need with the tainted coins."

In each great hall boils a cauldron, usually for a stew but occasionally for magic working, potions, and the distillation of souls and essences. A pair of elderly women, human or alseid, is often tasked with stirring, heating, and maintaining the cauldron for a period of time, always taking turns to deliver a fine meal or a well-turned potion to one of the hags or shadow fey who decide each cauldron's next purpose."

Other races from the Kingdom of the Bear have come to the Shadow Realm, initially to maintain contact between the shadow colony and their kin in the mortal world, but eventually many integrated into the existing bearfolk communities. Humans are the most prominent of these newcomer races, but a contingent of reaver dwarves who venerate bear spirit totems found their way here and decided to settle. The dwarves represent an invaluable asset to the Moonlit Glades since they are among the few seafarers willing to sail on the fog-shrouded black waters of Frost Gulf.

The peril they faced was deceptively minimal at first: the occasional shadow or unquiet spirit, predatory beasts that sought their first taste of uncorrupted flesh. These dangers were faced without difficulty, insulated from the most insidious creatures of shadow by their remote location. All too soon, they learned the true danger of the Shadow Realm remains one's own imperfect nature. Their numbers began to feel the force of corruption, and division struck their ranks. Melancholy gave way to paranoia, and that gave way to conflict. As the corruption spread, those who proved more resistant tried in vain to help their fellows, which only added fuel to the fire. Before long, the corrupted bearfolk turned on their own kin, and the blood spilled drew the attention of the umbral vampires. One day they were simply there, arising from dark ruins the bearfolk had never seen before. The warriors fought valiantly, but with their ranks reduced by spreading corruption, they knew they were doomed.",

The umbral vampires slipped through these widening cracks, their timeless nature drawing them to places where shadow bleeds into the world.

										"The greatest cautionary tale of the Shadow Realm is undoubtedly that of the umbral vampires. Once residents of a thriving metropolis, the rulers of this long-forgotten city were powerful spellcasters whose might put to shame even the greatest sorcerers of this current age. They were wise and just and used their power to preserve the glory of their people. And their decline began subtly.",
										"In an effort to prevent the inevitable march of time, the great archmages twisted it and diverted its flow. The entire population of the great city freed themselves of the shackles of age and death. For generations, they existed in this state, developing even greater magic, fine art, and architecture to rival the palaces of the gods. But for all their wisdom and might, they were blind to the danger set before them. As the river of time in the world around the city flowed on, it began to erode the spells holding it at bay. Eventually the spells failed, and the city drowned in all those many years it had denied. In the rush of uncontrolled magic and rampantly fluctuating time, the entire city vanished from the mortal world. Only the barest traces remain because the entire city was pulled into the darkness between worlds. The people of the once-great city felt the ravages of shadow corruption, but they were trapped in chaotic temporal storms. They spent an eternity in that closed loop of time, devoured by shadow, reborn and consumed again and again until finally the timestorm abated.",
										"When the winds of history settled, Oshragora, the City Fallen into Shadow, was born. Great, towering ruins appeared in the landscape of the Shadow Realm. Cobbled streets cracked and twisted, following new paths dictated by shadow's distortions. Buildings that once touched the sky now stand in a frozen jumble of collapse, held in unstable pockets of temporal stasis. These pockets fail, unwind, and reassert themselves at random. Bits of the city crumble or reassemble before an observer's eyes.",
										"The city defies conventional understanding of geography and space, even among other places in the Shadow Realm. While the rest of the plane shifts over the course of months or years, the City Fallen into Shadow seems to change without a predictable pattern or schedule."

										"Oshragora isn't sufficiently organized to be called a city-state, much less a nation. An unknown number of umbral vampires lurk in its crumbled buildings and shadow-choked alleys. Despite repeated attempts, no scouting force or explorer has ever made an accurate estimate of the city's cursed population. Umbral vampires simply slip between the cracks of reality as if they're still shifting through time and space. One half-mad shadow fey hunter raved that she fought and slew the same umbral vampire for weeks while lost in a forest that continually coiled back on itself.",
										"The umbral vampires' motivations remain obscure\u2014or at least prone to chaotic shifts. On occasion, one might be willing to speak with visitors rather than simply devouring their essence, but these conversations always prove frustrating. The vampires mention events out of chronological order and make references to people and places no sage can identify. In spite of this, they give the impression that they understand far more than they're able to effectively communicate. Shadow fey emissaries are certain that a ruling council still exists somewhere in the city, but the place's unstable nature has made it impossible to find. The Queen of Night and Magic has proclaimed that she will trade an emperor's ransom in treasure and secrets for a reliable connection to the umbral vampires' dark council\u2014or at least to Lord Nalgevar.",
										"Despite the difficulty of operating within the city and communicating with the vampires, other creatures exist there. Undead shadows thrive in and around the city (and in the splinters of the city that appear elsewhere), drifting in the wake of umbral vampires. For some reason, the shadows don't attack the umbral vampires, suggesting either some mastery the umbral vampires hold over the shadows or at least a perceived kinship. Ghouls from the {@book Twilight Empire|BookOfEbonTides|7|Twilight Empire} also make frequent trips to the city. Through covert means and interrogation, the shadow fey believe that the Twilight Emperor of the ghouls searches for some lost artifact hidden in the city. Whatever this artifact is, it likely has power over time, and it might even have been a part of the magic that doomed the city in the first place.",
										"Other stranger visitors appear in and around the city and its splinters, such as shadow mages and {@creature Eonic Drifter|ToB1-2023|eonic drifters} (see {@book Tome of Beasts 1|ToB1-2023|5}) who step between the past and future as one might cross into the next room, enigmatic travelers of the aeons.

As a result, the umbral vampires can't readily make use of shadow roads or even those spots where the planes connect to the Shadow Realm. Though much reduced from their former glory, they remain powerful and devilishly cunning. Perhaps their most disturbing talent is the ability to find weak spots in the barrier between the realms. This shadow reflection of the mortal world, where despair, blood, and darkness tear rifts between the worlds, draws the vampires, and their presence seems to hasten the opening of doorways to the Shadow Realm. Thankfully, the umbral vampires seem compelled to remain close to the ruins of Oshragora, so they exist in a limited area.",
										"Just as the city seems to warp the land around it, or at least to move in some fashion, so too does it occasionally shed pieces of itself. These splinters of the city, sometimes as little as a single ruined building and other times an entire neighborhood or district, simply appear elsewhere. As with the other distortion effects of the city, a splinter might emerge miles away and remain for days or weeks at a time. The splinters drag umbral vampires and other denizens along with them, depending on the size of the splinter. A single building might contain one umbral vampire and a host of shadows. A district, on the other hand, might release an onslaught of a dozen or more umbral vampires on the surrounding area.",
										"The bearfolk from the {@book Moonlit Glades|BookOfEbonTides|7|Moonlit Glades} have kept a watchful eye on Oshragora after a few disturbing appearances of splinters within their domain. They grow increasingly worried with each vampire encounter but don't have enough useful information to plan a suitable defense. So far, they've contained the umbral vampires in a dozen splinters until the splinters vanished, but their lack of arcane knowledge hampers their efforts beyond pure reaction. They're quite eager to learn how the splinters function and how to keep them at bay.",
										"The most recent addition to those scrutinizing the city includes the {@book Court of One Million Stars|BookOfEbonTides|6|Court of One Million Stars}. These strange fey drift through the ruins while enshrouded in starlight, which pains the shadows and umbral vampires. They study the city, but they meticulously avoid the areas of distorted time. Only one such creature has engaged in the briefest exchange while about its task. After obliterating a pack of umbral vampires with an incandescent wave of starfire, the luminous creature whispered to the only surviving adventurer, \"The Void calls to the Void. It must not be allowed to answer.\" The adventurer recounted his story to Revich, the blind angel in the {@book Court of Night and Magic|BookOfEbonTides|6|Court of Night and Magic}, before hurling himself from the top of the angel's tower."

While it only requires payment of milk and honey, those who go out of their way to befriend a house brownie find their kindness repaid in unexpected ways."

Green and alive when the bearfolk settled here, the oak was split by dark lightning some decades ago from a darakhul sorcerer locked in battle with the grove's elder. The sorcerer ultimately escaped, the elder died, and the tree never recovered. The bearfolk who train here are educated on the ways of the darakhul and their undead, all the better to destroy them."
										],
										[
											"2",
											"The Banshee-Haunted Grove. This tiny grove rests on the edge of an ancient battlefield. The site was initially chosen in order to watch for any undead, and when a banshee arose, she was immediately destroyed by the druids. However, she rose again the next night and was put down again\u2014only to rise once more the night after that, and the night after that. After more than a week of this cycle, the bearfolk realized she had no intention of harming anyone within the grove if left alone, and they have instead taken to studying her pathways through the forests and fields in the hopes of discovering her origins and putting her to rest."
										],
										[
											"3",
											"The Circle of Song. The natural stone henge of the Circle of Song is a curiosity. Carved by the wind whistling through the hillsides, on a gusty day, the stones of the grove sing as air passes through dozens of holes and passageways. Its strange geography also seems to be a focus for magic, and the druids of the Circle of Song can channel their abilities and shape the natural flow of the Shadow Realm around them with ease. They have learned to harmonize their own singing with the songs of the stones, creating a unique form of ritual."
										],
										[
											"4",
											"The Moonshadow Grove. The druids here are attuned to the shadows and can pass between the pools of darkness with ease. Recently, however, something has infested their grove's shadows, and those who attempt to step between them do not always reappear."
										],
										[
											"5",
											"The Moonfire Circle. In the center of this druid grove stands a brazier filled with cold-burning fire. The flame gives off a hollow white light and no warmth. It is harmless to living creatures from the mortal world but burns undead and those native to the Shadow Realm. Unfortunately, due to its nature, the druids have been unable to get the flame to grow or spread\u2014it does not ignite wood, paper, or other flammables like true fire does. If they can learn how to manipulate it, it would be a powerful weapon indeed. So far, they have managed to keep its existence a secret from other Shadow Realm denizens, for surely such a tool would never be allowed to remain in bearfolk hands if the shadow fey had any say over it. But it is only a matter of time until word gets out and armies descend upon them."
										],
										[
											"6",
											"The Grove of the Three Rivers. This grove is built in and around a fork of three small tributaries that branch off from the Styx and empty into three small pools. The bearfolk tend to these shadowy waters, attempting to commune with the souls trapped within. They have met with moderate success and have thus far \"rescued\" roughly 20 souls, encouraging them to pass on in some cases and sending them off as Stygian shades to discover the manner of their death and the secrets of their life in others. The druids here call themselves shade whisperers and find that violence is not the only answer to the evils of the Shadow Realm."
										],
										[
											"7",
											"The Bent Tree Grove. The druids of this grove have created an intricate, living housing system created by coaxing the trees to grow in certain designs and directions. Though they are patient when it comes to home construction, the druids are merciless in their training of shadow gnawers and have no hesitation when it comes to cutting out the rot of shadow corruption wherever they find it."
										],
										[
											"8",
											"The Circle of the Seven Sisters. Established by seven sisters who arrived in the Shadow Realm from the Arbonesse Forest, the Circle of the Seven Sisters has a tenuous connection to the mortal world. A pool of clear, fresh water stands in the center of the grove. The pool is fiercely guarded, both as a source of untainted water and as a pathway between the realms. Creatures who submerge themselves completely in the pool and swim directly toward the bottom for 1 minute emerge in the mortal world in Riverbend within the Arbonesse. Following the pathway back into the Shadow Realm is trickier however since the way through the river is only open during certain phases of the moon."
										],
										[

											"The Hearthollow Grove. Once a grove with many students and teachers, the Hearthollow Grove is now all but abandoned. Only the caretaker, Umalla, remains, and no bearfolk travel here anymore. Recently, even communication with Umalla has gone silent, and none of the bearfolk know the reason for the loss of this stronghold."
										],
										[
											"10",
											"The Blackwater Grove. Nestled on the banks of a massive lake, the druids of the Blackwater Grove have pulled something curious coffin from the shadowy waters. The box is made of heavy iron and etched with runes, and though it seems old, it shows no signs of rust or other degradation. Still, something is within, and the bearfolk here argue about whether they should open it, guard it, or return it to the lake. So far, Ellar Dannos, the bearfolk leader of this grove, has been content to study it in quiet contemplation for endless hours."
										],
										[
											"11",
											"The Circle of the Gloomflower. Once a massive grove of gloomflowers, a large swath of forest was cleansed by bearfolk druids who established the Circle of the Gloomflower. Though a latent psychic scream still pierces the air periodically, an echo of a memory of darker times in the land, this grove has known relative peace for some time now. Not long ago, however, the patrolling druids discovered some strange silver seeds that buffeted them with corrupting visions when touched. The gloomflower grove may be returning\u2014either through natural means or by someone's hand."
