The diseases described below delve deeper into what a fantasy disease can be, and how it can be implemented into a story or campaign.",
						"While the Medicine skill is always useful when dealing with diseases, some focus has been given to alternative skills to use when diagnosing or treating these diseases. Typically in D&D a disease can be cured easily with magic at relatively low levels. In the examples below, the methods of treated are more difficulty or require additional steps to make the usual remedies effective, not only to make these conditions more dangerous to parties with easy access to disease-curing magic, but also to evoke the tense and dramatic process that medicine can often be in fiction.",
						"In addition, some of these entries serve multiple purposes rather than simply being negative stat penalties to apply to players. For example, applying Blightpus to a horde of weak enemies can make them more dangerous to cleave through in close quarters, while Shroud Vine confers both penalties and desirable boons to those infected. At the end of this section are roll tables of plot hooks for each listed disease to use as inspiration for stories involving them.",

Or perhaps you simply don't want to have the hassle of repeatedly running complex cures that will slow down the pace of the game.

								"What happens when the target of a curse isn't a player? A curse can be a central element in a story. Perhaps the players are tasked with lifting a curse, or the villain of the story is the curse's victim. When not applied to players, you can take greater liberties with how the curse affects its victim. As written, a Rat Lord has no control over the rats that follow them, but you may wish a villainous Rat Lord to have such control. Or a non-player cursed with a Horrid Reflection frightens other people instead of themselves with their reflection. Such abilities could be too strong in the hands of creative players, and thus the curse fail to be a meaningful burden at all. But in the hands of the DM, can enhance the story. Many a curse in fiction comes with great power attached, but usually in such a way that the power isn't worth the price.",

						"There are countless ways of applying the contents of this document in your adventures. One way is to use them to inspire new monsters or as modifications to existing monsters. Sometimes a small twist is all you need to make a familiar foe feel fresh and exciting. Below are a few sample stat blocks to aid you. They are all creatures from the Monster Manual with one or two appropriate alterations. Bear in mind a couple of thing: First, that these are just examples to get you started and don't even begin to scratch the surface of how curses, diseases, hazards, traps, or poisons could be used in a campaign. Second, that non-player characters need not follow the same rules as player characters. Instead of following the rules written here to the letter, your focus should instead be on creating something that makes intuitive sense to the players, and is fun to engage with. For example, Contagious Troll Tumours only grants a very small amount of hitpoint regeneration to an infected player, since regeneration is a very powerful ability, but isn't meaningful when applied to a monster in a combat encounter. Instead, it makes more sense to give that monster regeneration more akin to that of a troll. It's more impactful and makes more sense to the players. Your players can't see the monster stat blocks, and likely won't notice as long as the mechanics remain somewhat consistent.",

				"{@b Symptoms:} This fungal infection causes pustules filled with green or orange ooze to form across an afflicted creature's skin. When they burst, they eject a caustic acid onto anything nearby. These pustules are highly noticeable and extremely uncomfortable.",
				"{@b Effects:} A diseased creature's skin is covered in a large quantity of acid-filled pustules. These pustules are volatile, and will burst if the diseased creature takes any bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage. When these pustules burst, each creature within 5ft must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 6 (2d6) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. The diseased creature automatically fails the save. This effect can't be triggered again for 1 hour while the infection is untreated, after which the acid pustules regrow.",
				"{@b Contracting:} Blightpus is the parasitic form of a fungus known as Bursting Blightpuff (See the Dungeon & Wilderness Hazards section below). Bursting Blightpuff normally grows in damp underground environments, but can be found in other places, coating surfaces with volatile acidic bulbs of either orange or green. These fungal growths, or other infected creatures, can transmit the infection, since the fungal spores are transmitted by the acid.

				"Acid pustules can be carefully drained to prevent them from exploding violently. The infected creature or another creature within 5ft can spend 10 minutes using a suitable sharp instrument to make a DC 13 Dexterity (Medicine) check.

Later stages of the infection involve the afflicted's skin being raw pink, and steam pouring out of the mouth, nose, and tear ducts. When injured, their blood visible sizzles and steams. Creatures killed by this disease seem to boil from the inside out, and continue to be unusually hot even after death, with some giving off the scent of cooked meat. Almost any activity that causes a victim's heart rate to accelerate is painful as their body courses with unbearable heat.",

				"Once 8 hours have passed, the afflicted creature becomes feverish. It has disadvantage on all ability checks, and struggles to rest.

In addition, the creature cannot sleep by normal means, and gains none of the benefits of sleeping.",

The fever intensifies, and the creature has disadvantage on all ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws. The creature can't sleep or gain any benefits from resting at all. Each time it exerts itself significantly or engages in some kind of physically strenous activity (such as taking the Dash action, making a weapon attack roll, or attempts to lift or drag more than their carrying capacity) it must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 1d4+1 fire damage.",
				"A creature imune to fire damage is also immune to all effects of Boiling Blood. A creature that has resistance to fire damage has advantage on all saving throws caused by this disease.",
				"{@b Contracting:} Boiling Blood is primarily transmitted through sweat, but can also be transmitted through other bodily fluids such as blood and saliva, so is usually only a threat to those in close contact with the infected such as family or medical proffessionals, or people who handle the clothes or bathwater of the infected. ",

The Boiling Blood pathogen cannot tolerate cold temperatures, so in extremely cold environments a creature has advantage on this save. ",

An infected creature targeted by a magical effect that cures disease must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a success, the disease is cured. On a failed save, the magic has no effect. ",
				"This disease easily survives heat from cooking or hot water, but cannot tolerate cold temperatures. Thus, icy cold water is best for washing one's hands, and freezing food for 8 hours destroys any Boiling Blood bacteria within it.",
				"A bath of icy water suppresses all effects of this disease. For each hour it spends submerged in icy water, or whenever it makes a saving throw against {@hazard Extreme Cold} or {@hazard Frigid Water} (DMG page 110), it can make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a success, the disease ends.",
				"Short bursts of cold damage as might be inflicted by magic or a white dragon's breath weapon don't affect this disease, only prolonged full-body cooling will be of any aid.",

Madness is often associated with this disease, but isn't an actual symptom of the pathogen, but a result of the mental stress of eating other people or being unable to eat. In animals, they turn more aggressive once they realise they can only eat humanoid meat.",

If not, it immediately regurgitates its meal and gains no nutritional benefit from eating. Neither can it imbibe potions unless the potion is mixed with blood or flesh of a humanoid.

However, the disease can also linger in water sources contaminated by bodies of those infected, and is also know to be incredibly cold-resistant, surviving frozen in ice or still cold water.",
				"In populations of humanoids where cannibalism has been practiced across multiple generation, such as certain tribes of lizardfolk or kobolds, the individuals may be immune to its effects but can still carry and transmit the disease, so conflict with these races can cause outbreaks, however most infections usually come about from wild animal attacks where small populations of predators becomes unusually aggressive and attack humans unprovoked in order to feed. Gnolls are also a know carrier of this disease, they aren't immune but they still seldom notice if they have it.",
				"A humanoid or beast that consumes the flesh of an infected creature or contaminated water, or is bitten by an infected creature, must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw against disease, becoming infected on a failure.",

Thus, someone who hasn't had the opportunity to observe the full effects of the disease can easily misdiagnose it.",

				"Wisdom (Survival) 12 or higher, and cannibalism has been seen to prevent vomiting \u2013 You know that Cannibal Craving is usually the result of infected meat or water, or bites from wild animals.",
				"{@b Treatment:} The disease is unusually hardy to disease-curing magic, perhaps as a result of living endemically in humanoid populations in ancient times. Most attempts to cure the disease using magic will just produce stomach pains. The disease has natural defences against both medicine and magic that would destroy it. The disease must first be weakened with poison. The poison must be mixed with humanoid flesh or blood to ensure that pathogen doesn't reject it, and then the poison must be consumed in order to flush it through the infected creature's digestive system. Once this has been done, magic or medicine will work as normal."

In extreme cases, missing limbs regenerate to become troll-like or the afflicted grows small vestigial appendages. Worse still, these embedded growths of troll flesh can regenerate into an entire troll if the growths kill the afflicted.",
				"{@b Effects:} The afflicted creature regenerates 1 hitpoint at the start of each of its turns, unless it has taken acid or fire damage since the start of its previous turn. If it's missing any body parts, they regrow when the creature finishes a long rest. An afflicted creature doesn't die or make death saving throws unless it cannot regenerate at the start of its turn, although it can still die normally by failing three death saves or through taking massive damage. For every 10 hitpoints the afflicted creature regenerates, or for each missing body part it regrows, the afflicted creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed saved, one green tumour of troll flesh forms on its body. The DC of the save equals 10 plus the number of tumours on the creature's body. If the DC of the saving throw reaches 20, and the creature fails that saving throw, it dies, and the tumours immediately grow into a Troll which appears in the dead creature's space. The afflicted creature automatically gains one tumour for every 24 hours that passes.",
				"{@b Contracting:} Contagious Troll Tumours really stretch the definition of disease. Trolls can regenerate from almost any injury given time, but can be slain. In the process of battling a troll, it and its foe invariably end up covered in each other's blood. This usually isn't an issue, but if tiny parts of the troll's being end up lodged in an open wound, they can adhere themselves as they try to regenerate. Even after the troll dies, these pieces of flesh survive thanks to grafting themselves into the host's circulatory system. This is the start of a troll tumour. Like a cancer, it grows uncontrollably within the host yet is rooted into its basic bodily functions, kept alive by the thing it is killing. Troll flesh regenerates and mutates much quicker than any mundane cancer, quickly overwhelming any immune response. As it grows, small parts of the tumour can break off and seed themselves in other parts of the body, forming new tumours.",
				"Usually only a heavily wounded troll whose regeneration is struggling to keep it alive or whose dismembered limbs are flailing about on their own can inflict CTT, and the only people at risk are those who have open wounds from the troll's attacks and are also attacking it with piercing or slashing damage from within 5ft. Anything that prevents a troll from regenerating also prevents it from spreading CTT. A less common way of contracting it is to eat a troll. Stomach acid usually deals with any potential tumours, but eating enough troll can still cause a tumour especially if one has cuts, bruises, or sores inside the mouth. When a troll dies, the DM determines which if any of the creatures that participated in the fight could have come into contact with troll gore while having open wounds.",
				"Each affected creature must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, becoming afflicted with CTT on a failed save.",
				"{@b Diagnosis:} Green troll flesh growths are easy to spot when they grow externally, but the usual giveaway for this affliction is the enhanced regeneration. Diagnosing the condition is tricky, but trickier still is knowing how to operate on the tumours without them simply growing back. People knowledgeable on giants are more likely to be able to accurately diagnose CTT. A creature that speaks Giant or otherwise has knowledge on giants and their history has advantage on ability checks made to diagnose CTT.",
				"Wisdom (Medicine) 5 or lower - Misdiagnosis. You have cool regeneration powers now. This can only be good for your health.",
				"Wisdom (Medicine) 10 or lower - These growths are out of control and need to be treated, but they heal so fast that you're not sure how to handle it.",
				"Wisdom (Medicine) 11 to 15 - You're not sure what caused these growths, but it seems that they get worse the more the afflicted regenerates from wounds. Using other forms of healing to close wounds before they can regenerate should slow down tumour growth.",
				"Wisdom (Medicine)16 or higher - You've heard of Contagious Troll Tumours, and know this to be caused by small fragments of troll flesh getting into open wounds. You know these tumours can eventually regenerate into a full troll. You believe that physically cutting out the growths is the best course of action, which is best done on a sedated patient.",
				"Intelligence (History) 12 to 16 - You've heard of trolls and their infamous ability to regenerate from almost any injury unless burned with acid or fire. These lumps of green flesh that heal extremely quickly reminds you of trolls.",
				"Intelligence (History) 17 or higher - You know a fair bit about trolls and the most extreme forms their regeneration can take, that even scraps of flesh can regrow into a full troll and that trolls sometimes graft the flesh of other creatures onto their own.",
				"{@b Treatment:} Trolls are extremely resilient even without their innate regeneration powers. CTT is no different. Tiny slivers of troll flesh inside the victim can be destroyed like almost any parasite, with magic that cures disease, but this will fail if any tumours have developed. The large tumours need to be surgically removed as they're too resilient to be magically cured. Removing a tumour requires a fine sharp instrument, and for the surgeon to make a Dexterity (Medicine) check. The surgeon can choose to only remove a selected number of tumours, which they may choose to do on fragile patients who might not easily survive a longer more invasive surgery. The DC of the check equals 10 plus the number of tumours the surgeon is attempting to remove. The surgery takes 5 minutes for each tumour the surgeon attempts to remove. On a success, the tumours are removed. If the total roll was less than 10, no tumours are removed. Otherwise, a partial success is achieved, and only some tumours are removed, an amount equal to the total of the medicine check minus 10. For each tumour removed, the patient takes 1 point of slashing damage. For each tumour the surgeon attempted to remove but failed, the patient takes 1+1d4 slashing damage. A removed tumour regrows unless the site of the tumour is immediately treated with acid or fire, enough to cause at least 1 point of damage.",
				"Unless the patient is incapacitated during the surgery, they are at risk of flinching. For each tumour removed while the patient is not incapacitated, the patient must make a Constitution saving throw. The DC for this save is 10 for a successfully removed tumour, 15 for a failed tumour removal. On a failed save, the patient flinches, and takes an additional 2d4 slashing damage from the tumour removal.",
				"Once a tumour is removed, it can still attempt to regenerate, although it is extremely weak. Unless the tumour is destroyed with fire or acid, roll a d10. On a 10, the tumour grows into a troll after 24 hours. Otherwise, it dies."

				"{@b Symptoms:} Earwyrms are tiny wingless draconic creatures that reside in the ear canal of other creatures. They numb the flesh around them so their presence isn't felt, using poison stinger like those of pseudodragons, but they have a habit of mimicking sounds they hear, especially music, their relatively quiet voices being quite loud enough when their heads are resting on one's eardrum. Earwyrms are harmless, but incredibly annoying. Their compulsive music mimicry can inhibit a creature's ability to hear things properly or sleep, which is especially distracting for spellcasters, and getting them excited or riled can provoke them into singing so loudly that their host cannot hear anything at all. Earwyrms sneak out of their host's ear when they sleep once every three days to search for food.",
				"{@b Effects:} Earwyrms have no stat block. They have a +0 bonus to all rolls, and have the Dragon type. While inhabiting another creature's ear canal, the Earwyrm has full cover against any effects originating from outside the host creature.",
				"A creature infected by an Earwyrm cannot percieve the Earwyrm while it is not making noise. The DM determines the Earwyrm's behaviour, which is erratic. The Earwyrm will repeat sounds it has heard, usually music, but also animal sounds or speech, and will continue to do so while it is awake. The earwyrm sleeps for 6 hours a day. While the earwyrm is awake, an infected creature has disadvantage on all Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing. If the Earwyrm chooses, it can generate noise loud enough to deafen its host.",
				"The Earwyrm is not normally dangerous, but is has a few ways of defending itself if a creature tries to remove it from its host.",
				"An Earwyrm doesn't wish harm to its host, but will retaliate if threatened with direct violence. It can emit a loud screech that deal 1 thunder damage to its host. It can deal this damage no more than once in a round.",
				"If its host is concentrating on a spell, the Earwyrm can unleash a distracting string of noise that forces the host to make a Concentration check with a DC of 10.",
				"Earwyrms aren't very intelligent but do understand that it is in their best interest to keep their host alive. Thus, Earwyrms will interfere on occasion whether their help is wanted or not, in the limited capacity as they are able. A Earwyrm will wake its host if they are sleeping and the Earwyrm percieves danger. They will intentionally deafen their host if the host is charmed by another creature, so that they can't hear any commands and thus cannot obey them. They will also use their screech to deal damage if the host is under the influence of magic such as the {@spell Sleep} or {@spell Dominate Person} spells where the target of the spell can repeat the save or end the effect if it takes damage.",
				"If an Earwyrm inhabits a single host for 10 days, it lays an egg, and leaves its current host to find a new one. The egg hatches into an Earwyrm after another 10 days.",
				"{@b Contracting:} Earwyrms live in all kinds if environments, where they prowl for sleeping prey. When they encounter a sleeping creature, the Earwyrm makes a Dexterity (Stealth) check against the target's Passive Perception score. On a failed check, the creature notices something crawling on them, which feels similar to a large insect, and deters the Earwyrm. On a successful stealth check, the sleeping creature remians unaware and is infected by the Earwyrm. An Earwyrm that leaves its host to feed doesn't need to make this check again when it returns, as it uses its venom stinger to numb its host's sense of touch enough that the light tread of an Earwyrm can't be detected.",
				"Some creatures are known to breed and train Earwyrms for domestic purposes, and intentionally allow themselves to become hosts. They are usually trained to mimic specific music the trainer wants them to repeat. More rarely, they're used for espionage, to act as hidden recording devices, and creatures that frequently come into conflict with mind-controlling creatures such as Illithids keep Earwyrms as rudimentary anti-charm measures. In these cases, the Earwyrms are likely to escape once they're out in the field unless fed frequently.",
				"{@b Diagnosis:} Despite being a relatively rare affliction, it's not hard to diagnose. Most intelligent creatures will choose to simply inspect an afflicted creature's ear canal, and might snatch a glimpse of the Earwyrm. Creatures knowledgeable on dragon type creatures can also know of Earwyrms. They might also roll to see if they know more.",

				"A creature that is targeted by poison-curing magic, or who is immune to poison, is healed of the numbing poison of the Earwyrm. A creature cured this way can percieve the Earwyrm inside their ear canal or when the Earwyrm leaves their body. The Earwyrm must make a new Dexterity (Stealth) check if it leaves.",
				"Earwyrms are difficult to remove by force without hurting the host, as they can dig their claws into the surrounding flesh. An Earwyrm must be Incapacitated, such as by the {@spell Sleep} or {@spell Hold Monster} spell before it can be removed.",
				"Earwyrms cannot speak but understand Draconic. An Earwyrm can be convinced to leave its host temporarily if a creature that speaks Draconic makes a DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check, and has some form of food to use as a lure.",

				"{@b Symptoms:} A creature suffering from Glass Delusion believes themselves to be partially or wholly made of some brittle substance, most commonly glass but sometimes other substances like earthenware or ice. Usually the afflicted creature believes their bones or a single limb to be affected, but full-body delusions rarely occur. This belief persists even in the face of objective evidence to the contrary. Typically a delusional creature becomes paranoid that the affected body part is now exceptionally fragile and takes great measures to protect it from damage, such as wearing incredibly thick padded clothing, restraining the relevant area in a cast, or even refusing to leave a safe place. A less common symptom is the target believing themselves to be transparent and somehow that any lies or secrets are now laid bare for all to see. Most cases of Glass Delusion escalate into extreme paranoia, as the afflicted creature is hounded on all sides by people telling it something it \"knows\" not to be true, which can often make them difficult to approach for treatment.",
				"{@b Effects:} The precise effects of Glass Delusion vary depending on what part of the body is the focus of the delusion. If a creature contracts Glass Delusion, the DM can choose any number of the options below, or roll to determine the effect randomly. Each form of the delusion also has a severe version with harsher effects. For every 10 days that the delusion isn't treated, the DM chooses to either add another focus area for the delusion, or for a severe version of the delusion to manifest in an already affected body part.",
				"{@b Contracting:} Glass Delusion sometimes occurs after a creature drinks a faulty potion. Black market love potions are notorious for this, but other potions that involve transmutation or mind-altering magic are also known culprits. Wicked creatures such as hags sometimes intentionally create draughts that induce this effect and use it to torment their foes. A creature that drinks a faulty potion must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw after the potion's effects end. The effects of the delusion start to appear after 3d6 hours.",
				"{@b Diagnosis:} Glass Delusion appears often in folk tales and historical anecdotes, and its symptoms are quite obvious, so its seldom rare for the condition to go unnoticed or undiagnosed even by those not learned in medicine.

				"{@b Treatment:} The key to treating Glass Delusion is in the mind. Magic that heals diseases doesn't work, although magic that cures indefinite madness does. Other mind-altering magics can also be used to improvise a cure, such as most charm effects. The best method is to use magic to charm someone into thinking they've been cured or that something you are offering them is an effective remedy. For example, using Charm Person to get a deluded patient to trust you and take the medicine or spell you offer them, or using Modify Memory to implant a false memory of being cured. This magically empowered placebo is a good remedy for a magic-caused delusion, but requires a bit of improvisation and creativity.

				"{@b Effects:} A Shroud Vine infection progresses through multiple stages of severity each day that the infection persists. Originating from the point of infection, vines start to grow over the victim until most of the victim's body is covered, at which point the infection is lethal.",
				"Stage 0: For the first 24 hours after contracting the disease, the afflicted creature shows no clear signs of being diseased. The only signifier of being infected appears one hour after contracting the disease, that being a slight discolouration and inflammation at the point of infection. There's no effects during this stage.",
				"Stage 1: First vine growth appears after 24 hours. Attempting to remove the growth causes 6 (2d6) piercing damage to the afflicted creature, and the vines regrow within 2 hours. This damage increases by 6 (2d6) for each stage of the disease.",
				"Stage 2: After 48 hours, the vine growth becomes larger. The afflicted creature can use the thorns to bolster its unarmed strikes using a covered part of its body. These thorns count as a natural weapon, dealing piercing damage equal to 1d4 + the creature's strength modifier. The vine begins to sap the vitality of its host. The creature requires twice the normal amount of food and water, and must spend at least 1 hour in direct sunlight each day to be considered properly nourished.",
				"Stage 3: After 72 hours, the vine growth covers roughly a quarter of the afflicted creature's body. The afflicted creature gains the ability to speak with and understand Plant type creatures within 10ft of it as if they shared a language. Additionally, if the Plant has an intelligence score of 5 or lower, it is nonhostile to the afflicted creature and will ignore it unless provoked. Whenever the afflicted creature regains hitpoints and is not in direct sunlight, the amount of hitpoints it regains is halved (minimum of 1 hitpoint).",
				"Stage 4: After 96 hours, the vine growth covers over half of the afflicted creature's body. The creature gains the ability to communicate simple ideas with nonmagical plants, such as significant events from the last day, any active threats in the area, or whether a plant is toxic. The creature gains no special ability to influence plants in this way. In addition, the creature can cause the vine growth to grow over armour it is wearing when it finishes a short rest in direct sunlight. The piercing damage of its thorns increases by 1d4, and its armour class can't be less than 13. The afflicted creature also has advantage on ability checks to hide in or around foliage. The thorns on its body are now contagious and capable of transmitting Shroud Vine to other creatures.",
				"Stage 5: After 120 hours, the disease finally begins to kill the afflicted creature. Once stage 5 is reached, the target's hitpoint maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the maximum value of its hit die every hour. When the creature's hitpoint maximum is reduced to zero, it dies.",
				"The creature instinctively knows that it is dying, and feels a strange compulsion to rest in areas of direct sunlight. If the creature is in an area of direct sunlight, it refuses to leave that area unless compelled by magic. Once the creature dies, a Shroud Vine bush sprouts from its body after 24 hours in the approximate size and shape of the dead creature.",
				"{@b Contracting:} The only ways to contract Shroud Vine are either through contact with a Shroud Vine bush or a creature in the late stages (Stage 4 or 5) of an infection. In either case, even a light scratch of the thorns can induce infection, with such a superficial injury being easily overlooked until visible symptoms set in. In the case of bushes, since they grow over the corpses of other victims, looters are often scratched when drawn to the belongings of the dead. Shroud Vine bushes appear in rough silhouettes of the creatures they killed, forming eerie shadows or humanoids and beasts. These bushes occur in the forests on the material plane in all biomes but are rare except where cultivated by especially isolated druids, in the feywild where they can form small groves and are weaponised by hags, and even in the Abyss, most notably Demogorgon's realm of the Gaping Maw. A creature scratched by a Shroud Vine must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, becoming infected on a failure. A creature that succeeds on this save is immune for the next 24 hours.",

				"Intelligence (Nature) 15 or higher \u2013 You know this infection is caused by Shroud Vine, and you know that it grows in creature-shaped bushes that grow over the bodies of those who die to the infection.",
				"Wisdom (Survival) 15 or higher \u2013 You've heard of Shroud Vine, and know its transmitted through the thorns and is usually lethal. You also know that people with the parasite go mad, talking to plants and seek to lie in sunlight, and that tearing the growths off does more harm than good.",
				"{@b Treatment:} Shroud Vine has a two-stage treatment. First, the exterior vines need to be removed. This process pulls at roots in the skin, which can seriously harm an afflicted creature, but treatment is ineffective without this first step. Once the vines are removed, ordinary disease-curing magic will instantly cure the affliction.",
				"Attempting to cure the disease without removing the vines simply slows its growth, preventing progress to the next stage for 24 hours, and this technique is used by people who want to reap certain benefits from the disease such as the ability to talk to plants. If a creature's Shroud Vine infection is prevented from progressing for 30 days, it becomes symbiotic, and doesn't progress any further.",
				"Anyone trying to experiment with magic to cure Shroud Vine ought to be careful. Targeting an afflicted creature with magic that increases plant growth instantly causes the infection to progress one stage."
