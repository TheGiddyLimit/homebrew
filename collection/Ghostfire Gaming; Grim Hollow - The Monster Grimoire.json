If anyone among the player characters is an inquisitor, she changes her plans and asks if they could vouch for her so she can return to her post. Regardless, if the player characters agree to assist Abree in keeping her safe from the Inquisition, she happily travels with and fights alongside them."

For as long as the Valikan Clans have told tales, their stories spoke of Gegazol's rage\u2014though none who live have seen her. In the early centuries, Gegazol was a living dragon, many say an offspring of the Prismatic Wyrm Gormadraug. She lived, that is, until she attacked a daemon. The battle was ferocious, as the dragon and fiend fought for life. Gegazol won, tearing the fiend in half, but her victory had a price. As the daemon's ichor flowed upon the dragon, it killed and later cursed her body with the filth of undeath. Gegazol raged at her reawakening and proceeded to tear at and destroy her own undead body, only to reform later near the body of the vanquished daemon. The skull of the demon acts as the dragon's soul vessel.",

								"The bugbears of Etharis weren't always ferocious and violent. When the Arch Daemons appeared in the world, Tormach believed he could make minions of the goblinoids. Bugbear warriors forcefully opposed his efforts to subvert goblin tribes to his will. Tormach commanded his servants to craft a disease that would render defiant bugbears into vicious drones, a grim task those minions completed with great success. Tormach's Rage, as the disease has come to be known, spread quickly. Most bugbears of Etharis are now victims of this mind-altering plague.",
								"The disease causes a bugbear to become more resilient while increasing muscle mass and capacity for aggression. Bugbears infected with Tormach's Rage experience a powerful, instinctive urge to spread their illness. Infected bugbears have enhanced olfactory senses that allow them to smell whether a creature carries Tormach's Rage. When they discover a bugbear without the disease, they fly into a frenzy. The sickness is virulent enough that even if a bugbear survives the fight or kills the infected aggressor, it's unlikely to do so without contracting Tormach's Rage."

The three books form the complete set of books for gamemasters to run dark fantasy and horror campaigns in the Grim Hollow setting.",
								"The Grim Hollow setting takes place in a world known as Etharis, a dark and gritty environment where the vicious, terrible, horrifying monsters that hide in the shadowy alleyways and remote wildernesses are only the start of the peril. As much as the monsters of the world threaten the citizenry, the dark figures that entice those who seek power are just as dangerous. Blood magic, undeath, lycanthropy, fey magic, fell sorcery, and other temptations: would-be heroes are always one wrong step away from becoming the villains they claim to fight."

These rules encourage a type of play that invites characters to make the most of their knowledge and proficiencies, as well as their downtime, in order to have the best chance of surviving the threats they face. The blood, bones, brains, and bile of the creatures they kill might provide characters with advantages later. Weapons, potions, components, and other magic items might not be readily available, but the characters can make their own from salvaged parts of monsters.

Use these checks to dole out important information. Some checks might require characters to do some research, or even face the creature to observe its traits and behavior. Failed checks could result in characters gaining incorrect or partial bits of information, which could lead to dire consequences."

The Churning's remains contain vast amounts of pulverized material, from wood chips to rubble\u2014more than it seems the Churning could contain, despite its size. Magic items survive longer, and some the Churning can't break down. More than one tale of the Churning tells of heroes who temporarily stopped the creature, finding a magic device they needed for further exploits in the remains. It's as if the Churning, as a bizarre force of balance and rebirth, is an instrument of fate in this way."

								"The dark and dangerous world Of Etharis, home to the Grim Hollow fantasy setting, challenges all who live there. And the deadliest challenges to those who trod the adventuring roads of Etharis are the terrifying, bizarre, and fantastical beasts who lurk in the shadows or tower over the cities. Corrupted humanoids bent and twisted by otherworldly forces, enervating undead seeking to snuff out the light of life, malicious fey pursuing their own devious and capricious ends, putrid aberrations serving masters imprisoned in realities beyond the mortal realm: these forces, and more, challenge those seeking peace and prosperity in a hostile world.",
								"Grim Hollow: The Monster Grimoire offers over 400 new monsters, tailor-made for a dark fantasy campaign. The foes detailed in this supplement, ranging from capricious fey to corrupt fiends, can fit nicely into any 5e campaign where the players are looking for a devious and deadly challenge. The monster lore and statistics are just the beginning. Each monster comes with suggested salvage! Monster entries detail methods that characters might use to harvest monster parts to turn into equipment or magic items. Additional material discusses creating characters from some of the monsters, using them to their utmost tactical and narrative potential, and running intelligent monsters as intelligently as possible.",
