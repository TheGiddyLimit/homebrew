If anyone among the player characters is an inquisitor, she changes her plans and asks if they could vouch for her so she can return to her post. Regardless, if the player characters agree to assist Abree in keeping her safe from the Inquisition, she happily travels with and fights alongside them."

For as long as the Valikan Clans have told tales, their stories spoke of Gegazol's rage\u2014though none who live have seen her. In the early centuries, Gegazol was a living dragon, many say an offspring of the Prismatic Wyrm Gormadraug. She lived, that is, until she attacked a daemon. The battle was ferocious, as the dragon and fiend fought for life. Gegazol won, tearing the fiend in half, but her victory had a price. As the daemon's ichor flowed upon the dragon, it killed and later cursed her body with the filth of undeath. Gegazol raged at her reawakening and proceeded to tear at and destroy her own undead body, only to reform later near the body of the vanquished daemon. The skull of the demon acts as the dragon's soul vessel.",

Bugbear warriors forcefully opposed his efforts to subvert goblin tribes to his will. Tormach commanded his servants to craft a disease that would render defiant bugbears into vicious drones, a grim task those minions completed with great success. Tormach's Rage, as the disease has come to be known, spread quickly. Most bugbears of Etharis are now victims of this mind-altering plague.",
								"The disease causes a bugbear to become more resilient while increasing muscle mass and capacity for aggression. Bugbears infected with Tormach's Rage experience a powerful, instinctive urge to spread their illness. Infected bugbears have enhanced olfactory senses that allow them to smell whether a creature carries Tormach's Rage. When they discover a bugbear without the disease, they fly into a frenzy. The sickness is virulent enough that even if a bugbear survives the fight or kills the infected aggressor, it's unlikely to do so without contracting Tormach's Rage."

The three books form the complete set of books for gamemasters to run dark fantasy and horror campaigns in the Grim Hollow setting.",
								"The Grim Hollow setting takes place in a world known as Etharis, a dark and gritty environment where the vicious, terrible, horrifying monsters that hide in the shadowy alleyways and remote wildernesses are only the start of the peril. As much as the monsters of the world threaten the citizenry, the dark figures that entice those who seek power are just as dangerous. Blood magic, undeath, lycanthropy, fey magic, fell sorcery, and other temptations: would-be heroes are always one wrong step away from becoming the villains they claim to fight."

These rules encourage a type of play that invites characters to make the most of their knowledge and proficiencies, as well as their downtime, in order to have the best chance of surviving the threats they face. The blood, bones, brains, and bile of the creatures they kill might provide characters with advantages later. Weapons, potions, components, and other magic items might not be readily available, but the characters can make their own from salvaged parts of monsters. And in some cases, monsters might be nigh invulnerable unless the characters use their wits."

As the daemon's ichor flowed upon the dragon, it killed and later cursed her body with the filth of undeath.

								"This game is, to some extent, a game about resource management: defeat all the enemies in your path before you run out of hit points, spells slots, ki points, rages, etc. Many memorable campaigns make time as valuable a resource as any other.",
								"To make these time-valuable campaigns work, you must integrate the drama of time passing into the unfolding story. For example, it might be necessary for the characters to create a certain item to defeat a looming opponent, but other tasks are also pressing. The decision of whether to create the item, take on the other tasks, or split the party becomes important.",
								"It's of the utmost importance to remember, however, that forcing players to sit out even parts of sessions to watch others play might not provide the most fun. In cases like this, you have options. If two of the characters are needed to create an item, and the rest of the characters go off to perform a task, you have options to keep the players of the crafting characters involved. Companion characters can be hired to join the party for a mission. (A few interesting options are provided in this book.) Players can be allowed to make decisions and roll dice for the monsters the other characters are fighting on their side-mission. Just because the characters are absent doesn't mean the players can't participate in significant and fun ways."

Even better, provide a home base for the party where such characters are not just accepted, but they are welcomed.

								"The dark and dangerous world Of Etharis, home to the Grim Hollow fantasy setting, challenges all who live there. And the deadliest challenges to those who trod the adventuring roads of Etharis are the terrifying, bizarre, and fantastical beasts who lurk in the shadows or tower over the cities. Corrupted humanoids bent and twisted by otherworldly forces, enervating undead seeking to snuff out the light of life, malicious fey pursuing their own devious and capricious ends, putrid aberrations serving masters imprisoned in realities beyond the mortal realm: these forces, and more, challenge those seeking peace and prosperity in a hostile world.",
								"Grim Hollow: The Monster Grimoire offers over 400 new monsters, tailor-made for a dark fantasy campaign. The foes detailed in this supplement, ranging from capricious fey to corrupt fiends, can fit nicely into any 5e campaign where the players are looking for a devious and deadly challenge. The monster lore and statistics are just the beginning. Each monster comes with suggested salvage! Monster entries detail methods that characters might use to harvest monster parts to turn into equipment or magic items. Additional material discusses creating characters from some of the monsters, using them to their utmost tactical and narrative potential, and running intelligent monsters as intelligently as possible.",
								"All this and more await you within this copy of Grim Hollow: The Monster Grimoire."
