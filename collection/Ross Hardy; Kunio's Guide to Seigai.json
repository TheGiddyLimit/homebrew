								"This guide in its inception was intended to inspire DMs to try running D&D in an \"East-Asian\" fantasy setting. I had unknowingly stepped into a controversy I didn't fully understand at the time, and I am very much still learning. Before you get inside the guide, I'd like to mention the topic of Orientalism and the problematic history D&D has had with it.",
								"TSR published {@i Oriental Adventures} for AD&D in 1985. This supplement unfortunately fell foul of all of the tropes of the West-gazing-East. For example, let's take a look at what it says on the back cover:",
								"{@i \"The mysterious and exotic Orient, land of spices and warlords, has at last opened her gates to the West.\"} (Yikes.)",
								"{@i Oriental Adventures} takes Japanese, Chinese, Mongolian, and Korean ideas and uses them to create a land called Kara-Tur, home of a homogenized East-Asian superculture. The supplement leans heavily on stereotypes and presents the people of Kara-Tur as \"violent and savage, uncivilized and in need of foreign saviors and as objects of fetishization\" (Daniel Kwan). The authors encode this fetishization of the exotic via a seventh core attribute named Comeliness, which affects how your character is interacted with, and has bonuses or penalties depending on your character's race. (This attribute appeared solely in {@i Oriental Adventures} and {@i Unearthed Arcana}.)",
								"It is this othering of East-Asian cultures, and a determination to blur the lines between them, that I'm slowly coming to understand more about. While there has been a great deal of cultural interaction and exchange in East-Asia, that does not give license for an alien observer like myself to pool many of these cultures for inspiration, take my favorite bits, sandpaper out any nuance, and thus miseducate people.",
								"For that reason I chose to narrow my scope to late Sengoku-era Japan and its folklore. My goal was to create a mirror image of Japan where the animism in Shinto was fully grounded in reality.",
								"The way I chose to go about this was to fully acknowledge my status as an alien, writing as Lafcadio: a man who made a long voyage, experienced cultureshock, and brought back what they had learned to educate those in their homeland. I wrote this way as it was my lived experience. I recognize however that this narrative device made my guide yet one more perpetrator of othering.",
								"Lafcadio was named after the Greek-Irish folklorist Lafcadio Hearn, who travelled to Japan and spent much of his life there. His writings personally inspired me; however, he was also partly responsible for propagating some of the most harmful Orientalist tropes. Since the first edition I replaced Lafcadio with Kunio, a native Seigai citizen. Kunio is inspired by one of Hearn's contemporaries, Yanagita Kunio, who wrote an excellent collection of folk tales named {@i The Legends of Tono}. I recommend this one to any GM\u2014there are times where it reads like a collection of useful plot-hooks.",
								"Additionally, I made much more effort to educate myself on Japanese culture, holding ideals of accuracy and respectfulness in my writing and art selection. Kunio makes sure to point out the fantastical elements of Seigai, as well as its flaws. I am sure I haven't done this perfectly, so please do send me a note if you find areas that fall short of those ideals so that I can amend them in a future edition.",
								"If you choose to run games in Seigai and you are not Japanese (which is probably most of you!), please approach the games you run with those same ideals. You don't have to do it perfectly! But please do it humbly, and lean towards nuance, rather than stereotype.",
								"I would like to take one last paragraph to highlight two educational resources. Firstly the {@i {@link Asians Represent|http://oneshotpodcast.com/interview-discussion/asians-represent/}} podcast, whose work has been an incredible help in the creation of this guide. Secondly, for help with playing a character of another ethnicity, check out James Mendez Hodes' excellent article {@i {@link \"May I Play A Character From Another Race?\"|https://jamesmendezhodes.com/blog/2019/2/14/may-i-play-a-character-from-another-race}}. Please go and support them, and continue to amplify minority voices.",

								"Seigai, much like Japan, consists of not one homogenous culture, but a number of different ethnic groups and cultures. South of Japan is the Ryukyu island chain, home of the Ryukyuan people. Meanwhile, the Ainu people have called Hokkaido in Northern Japan their home for hundreds of years.",
								"Both of these groups have their own language, religion, culture, and traditions. However, since the Meiji government in the 19th century, these two people groups have faced systematic erasure and forced assimilation with the stated goal of unification in order to create a \"pure\" Yamato ethnicity. Ainu and Ryukyuans still face discrimination to this day. Only in 2019 was a section of the Meiji-era policy unwound with the Ainu Promotion Act, where the Ainu were finally recognised as an indigenous and distinct ethnicity. The Ryukyuan people are not recognised as a minority group at all.",
								"This guide occasionally contains depictions of characters with Ainu and Ryukyuan-inspired heritage in order to broaden your imagination and recognize the wonderful diversity of Seigai, and thus, Japan."

						"It was a September morning in Bōfūshi. The cicadas in the cedar trees sent shrill melancholic calls into the early dawn, and I arose from my bed to walk the boards to the other wing, where I would prepare breakfast for my guest. Xuurth-san had been staying under my roof for many months now, and while I was grateful for the routine, I did wonder when he would finally have all the material he needed to complete his manuscript.",
						"As I passed Xuurth-san's room, I noticed the warm diffuse glow of the lamps inside. Either he had once again fallen asleep at his desk, or he had been up all through the night. I thought about calling on him, however before I could enquire, the screen door slowly slid open.",
						"\"It is complete,\" announced Xuurthsan with a characteristic deadpan expression. He looked even more dishevelled than usual, and I admit I felt embarrassed for him. He paused in the doorway",
						"\"Ah! Good. You must be very pleased,\" I answered.",
						"\"Yes\u2014I suppose so.\" Xuurth-san stared long at the rolls of paper sheets he held. \"I do not think it is very good.\"",
						"\"Oh. I'm sure it is just fine.\"",
						"He met my eyes for the first time. \"No, I believe it needs work. Here\u2014look.\" He nonchalantly dropped the stack and unrolled a scroll. We glanced through the preface together. He was right, of course. If his observations were calligraphy, it was as if he had made all the right strokes, but not necessarily in the right stroke order.",
						"I let out a long sigh. \"Dear friend. You have made a fine go at it. I suppose you may benefit from having access to my writings. They are written with no great imagination; just matter-offact reflections I have made and felt worth recording for posterity. Let me show you to my study.\" I gave him the warmest, most sincere smile I could muster.",
						"He followed me across the walkway to a room at the back. I dragged open the door and beckoned him in.",
						"My study is no great palace. However as Xuurthsan's eyes roamed across the shelves of boundpocket notebooks, I felt a pride grow within me; a feeling of satisfaction at my own discipline. He reached towards the first shelf and gently pulled a book loose, placing it upon my desk, and began thumbing through the pages.",
						"For the next few months we embarked on a great project together, to attempt to describe each others' country of origin to the other, in a meaningful way for cultural study. At the point of completion, we both shared great contentment and felt thoroughly enriched by the exchange of cultures. He returned to his homeland with a copy of this book, {@i Kunio's Guide to Seigai}. He left me with his own work, {@i Limbo for Terrestrials}. (It is a stellar read.)",
						"As I write this, I can once again hear the cicadas from my study, calling me back to that fresh Autumn morning. The entomologist could tell you that as a cicada reaches the end of its larval stage, it emerges from the surface, shedding its husk on a nearby tree, and takes wing. Indeed, I only regret taking so many years to notice their pattern, and follow its example."

						"In the South-East quarter of the Etrican Islands lies the realm of Seigai. The island consists of two landmasses connected by a narrow land-bridge, resembling the gaping maw of the country's famous {@i ō-ryū} dragons. It has always seemed to me a striking silhouette, like some playful flourish by the {@i kami} who built this land in primordial times.",
						"The land that comprises the upper jaw is named Shōjōshima. This land is rich in minerals and dominated by agriculture; however, as the rich farmland is highly prized, this area has seen much conflict, and has only managed to rebuild in the last twenty years.",

						"The remaining portion of Seigai is known as Shōdanshima. This land is less populated than Shōjōshima as the challenging terrain limits travel to the main road, which leads travelers from the capital of Kōtoshi at the neck down to the most remote city of Enfūshi at the chin.",
						"The mountain range known as Seigai's Teeth (Seigai-no-Hanarabi) runs parallel to this main road, with two traversable passages to the city of Akugaku to the North. Shōdanshima receives a large amount of yearly rainfall, giving rise to the region's thick jungles. These are dangerous places inhabited by creatures known as {@i yōkai}\u2014preternatural creatures of both auspicious and calamitous portent.",
						"While the {@i yōkai} are at present the greatest threat to life that a Seiganese citizen may face, this has not always been the case. The land of Seigai is contested by the eight dragon {@i daimyō} who have spent most of the last four-hundred years at war. Now that there is a {@i shōgun} with clear authority again, a window of flourishing and entrepreneurship has presented itself. How long the peace will last, well, one cannot say.",

Its length extends over eight valleys and eight hills, and if one looks at its belly, it is all constantly bloody and inflamed.\"",

Also make a fence round about, in that fence make eight gates, at each gate tie [together] eight platforms, on each platform put a liquor-vat, and into each vat pour the eight-fold refined liquor, and wait.\"",
										"So as they waited after having thus prepared everything in accordance with his bidding, the eight-forked serpent came truly as [the old man] had said, and immediately dipped a head into each vat, and drank the liquor. Thereupon it was intoxicated with drinking, and all [the heads] lay down and slept. Then His-Swift-Impetuous-Male-Augustness drew the ten-grasp blade, that was augustly girded on him, and cut the serpent in pieces, so that the River Hi flowed on, changed into a river of blood."

								"There was a powerful {@i oni} demon by the name of Oniō-sama who lived in the mountains North-East of Kōtoshi. Oniō-sama was a child of Chinushi-sama, born long before Chinushi-sama was defeated by Ran-sama. Over the centuries, Oniō-sama grew in power and ambition, and longed to replace Suinushi-sama as the Emperor of Seigai. He gathered unto himself a clan of {@i oni} and {@i yōkai} both fearsome and mighty, and began a campaign of terror against the citizens of Kōtoshi.",

Knowing Oniō-sama had a weakness for alcohol just like his father, the Emperor also provided a flask of poisoned sake with which to render Oniō-sama incapacitated.",
								"The warriors disguised themselves as monks and allowed themselves to be captured. While in custody, they appealed to the Oni-King's hospitality, suggesting an evening of frivolity and drinking. As the night grew late, the warrior Raikō offered Oniō-sama the poisoned flask, of which he drank.",
								"As the poison set in, Oniō-sama fell into a deep slumber, and his true appearance was unveiled: limbs the size of tree trunks; fifteen eyes adorned his five-horned head; his torso was brick-red and he had limbs of yellow, blue, black, and white.",
								"Raikō augustly unsheathed the Heavenly Sword and sliced off Oniō-sama's head. However, like his father Chinushi-sama, the rage and malice flowing through Oniō-sama gave his severed head supernatural vitality, and he promptly grasped upon the Heavenly Sword with his giant teeth and shattered it into shards.",
								"With this final act, the Oni-King achieved a frightful terror; the heads of his father Chinushi-sama were no longer bound by fear of the sword, and at once they burst forth from Yomi, the land of the dead, where they had been held. At this news, the Emperor fled East to his palace in the sea, where he resides to this day.",
								"The newly freed {@i chinushi-zu} began to divide the land up among themselves, and soon realized that without symbolic authority, their rule would be met with resistance. This authority they claimed by retaining the institution of Emperor, which Suinushi-sama still symbolically holds. They left the capital Kōtoshi and its surrounding lands vacant.",
								"Their centuries-long exile in Yomi had done little to temper the bickering and in-fighting between the heads, and almost as soon as they claimed dominion over Seigai as {@i daimyō}, the border disputes began. Seiganese of low social status were forced to fight for their {@i daimyō} and paid the highest price in these pointless wars.",
								"Three-hundred years of ubiquitous chaos ensued. The land was rent and torn; crops failed; evil {@i yōkai} emerged from the forgotten places and fed on the bodies of the fallen; and most of all no-one felt safe.",
								"During this period, whichever of Chinushi-sama's heads had the most military might at any point claimed the title of {@i shōgun}, the de-facto leader of Seigai. The title changed hands many times, and the cyclical pattern was only finally interrupted by outside influence. When the {@i shōgun} Chinushi Nobunaga of Gunjinban established a trading relationship with a nearby nation and imported large quantities of the matchlock rifle, this delivered a martial advantage to his whole army that had only been achievable through magic up to this point. Chinushi Nobunaga exploited this advantage mercilessly and soon had the other seven {@i daimyō} subdued. Chinushi Nobunaga now controlled the only land-route to the capital and fiercely guarded it with his army of gunners.",
								"To stamp his authority, Chinushi Nobunaga obtained (and most likely faked) a decree from Suinushi-sama to establish a political police force named the Azure Guard, which would be present in every city in Seigai, and loyal to the {@i shōgun}.

						"The people of Seigai are known as the {@i seigaijin}, or Seiganese people. It is an overly simplistic taxonomy; in truth there are many \"societies\" within Seigai. For now, I will speak broadly, else I shall be old and bald before I finish.",
						"Firstly, it is worth noting the racial composition of the Seigai society. There is some variance depending on whether you find yourself in Shōjōshima or Shōdanshima, but you will generally find over half of the population consisting of {@race human|phb|humans}, followed in order of decreasing prevalence: {@race ryūson|KGtSeigai} (humanoid descendants of the {@i ō-ryū}), {@race shapechanger|KGtSeigai|shapechangers}, {@race kappa|KGtSeigai} (tortoise-like creatures), {@race masaru|KGtSeigai} (intelligent macaques), {@race halfling (bunagaya)|KGtSeigai|bunagaya} (orange-haired halflings), and {@race dwarf (korpokkur)|KGtSeigai|korpokkur} (butterbur dwarves). These seven are known as the {@i shichijin}.",
						"In rural regions, beings of the same race often do cluster together in order to maintain their traditions (as carrying the torch is one of the tenets of Seigai religion). Meanwhile, urban areas are hotspots of cultural exchange. One of the quirks of the {@i shōgun's} recent decree that travelers must register at checkpoints during their journey has increased this all the more, as farmers are able to take advantage of foot traffic at these checkpoints to increase their trade. Merchants no longer have to travel into remote areas to make connections; as their trade has grown, they have also grown in power. A merchant group known as Shōnin-ikki has emerged, uniting many merchants under a single banner.",
						"In spite of these new freedoms, everyday life in Seigai is still conducted under the watchful eye of the Azure Guard, the police force of Seigai. The Azure are hard to miss, dressed in their pearlescent blue armor. Anyone can \"take up the blue\" as they say, and join the ranks of the Azure Guard. It is a popular career path for the descendants of conscripts who spent their whole life fighting for their {@i daimyō}.",
						"In addition to the {@i Records of Ancient Matters}, tales of ghost stories, known as {@i kaidan}, are popular among the Seiganese. These precautionary tales are essential lore in Seigai, which can be a dangerous place to live, especially in Shōdanshima if you were to wander outside the safe walls of the checkpoints and towns. It is far safer to travel by sea, but even this is fraught with peril as many {@i yōkai} hide in the depths. Rather than send the valuable Azure to patrol these roads, well-paying contracts are available to capable individuals. Each contract usually requires some proof that a threat has been dealt with, for instance some kind of trophy from a hostile creature. (On some rare occasions, a member of the Azure, or even a {@i samurai}, may join to observe the contract's fulfilment.) Those who undertake these contracts are typically referred to as the {@i rōnin} (see {@book The Life of a Rōnin: Mercenaries|KGtSeigai|6|Mercenaries}).",
						"{@i Rōnin} are paid from the coffers of whatever {@i daimyō} governs the prefecture. (An official once noted to me that, in their opinion, every {@i daimyō} is more than capable of dealing with many of the local threats themselves, as they are dragons of incredible power. The contracts are merely a diversion to give the {@i rōnin} an external foe so that their gaze does not point upwards. This example points to both the cunning and the laziness of the {@i chinushi-zu}.)",
						"The {@i daimyō} will go to any length to present the veneer of stability, peace, and harmony. Those with longer memories will tell you all about the centuries of jealousy and in-fighting that preceded this present truce. The conflict between Daizeihan and Tagūhan is an anachronism; typically of late, rival {@i daimyō} have been known to employ {@i rōnin} for missions of sabotage and espionage, thereby washing their hands of any accountability. These missions are reserved for only the most trusted of {@i rōnin}, but I am told the rewards are quite generous.",

The highest of the {@i daimyō} is the the {@i shōgun}, who commands the loyalty of the Azure Guard, enforcing the peace through his military power.",
						"Despite his strong-arm dictatorship, the peace enforced by Chinushi Nobunaga is a far better state-of-affairs than the centuries of war that preceded it. The optimism and lightheartedness of the people is hardly quashed, and can be observed during the numerous festivals throughout the year. An excuse to celebrate and remember those who fought for the present peace can always be found.",
						"As a whole, the Seiganese people value three things above everything else: to always do your best, to consider others, and to keep improving.

Even a well-skilled daitengu such as the one that lay sprawled out before her could stand little chance against the combined force of six {@i rōnin}. By the time the daitengu had realized he was outmatched, it was too late to call the many kotengu cowering in the cliffs above the temple to his aid. To think, his entire life training for this moment, only for it to be over so quickly. What a waste, Raikō thought.",
								"She tentatively tiptoed down the claytiles of the roof and tossed the daitengu's polearm down below, where her companion Bisuda stood picking grime out from under his claws. As the naginata struck the stone ground, it clanged loudly, and Bisuda leapt into the air startled, landing on all four paws. Raikō let out a squeal of amusement. She had just learned that morning that Bisuda tended to overreact to loud noises, and she intended to use that information well, and often.",
								"The journey up the mountains had been long and exhausting, but such things were to be expected when undertaking {@i rōnin} contracts. They had been sent to investigate strange reports coming from the villagers in the valley below: the bronze bell of the cliff-top temple was ringing in the dead of night. Not that unusual, except the temple was abandoned to the tengu; noone resided there any more.",
								"As a {@i bushi}, a Seiganese warrior mercenary, she knew her inclusion on the mission meant that a violent outcome was highly probable. Apart from a few nuisance kotengu throwing rocks at them however, they had made it to the temple mostly unscathed. She had been beginning to feel shortchanged. She need not have worried.",
								"It was not Raikō's first encounter with tengu by any means. The beaked and feathered humanoids were a common foe along the full extent of Shōdanshima. The daitengu she faced today however was a far more reclusive type. Unlike the kotengu, daitengu had smooth skin, and in place of the beak stood a long proud nose. Kotengu had to grasp their weapons in their talons in order to fly using their winged arms; daitengu meanwhile benefited from two large wings on their backs, leaving their hands free to wield a sword or polearm and, if needed, quickly retreat to an elevated position. This was exactly why Raikō now found herself on the temple roof.",
								"The slaying of the daitengu did not however solve the mystery of the bell, and would not constitute the fulfilment of the contract. Raikō and her companions still had a job to complete, and she now turned her attention to the shōrō outbuilding, where the bell was housed. The primary purpose of the bonshō bell in Seigai was to call the monks to prayer. Bonshō were also designed to create powerful {@i sonon} auras when struck; these were known to frighten away evil {@i yōkai} and ward the temple.",
								"Why, then, would a tengu want to strike the bell? Raikō turned the thought over in her mind, trying to make sense of it. Her companions Taba and the foreigner Faust had already begun to inspect the bell, and Raikō wandered over to join them. Taba picked up a nearby mallet and experimentally gave the bell a light tap. At once the air felt thick and heavy, the {@i sonon} waves pushing it around like an oar in the ocean. Faust pointed up, and the three of them craned their necks to gaze at a shadow in the beams above the bell.",
								"All of a sudden, the ghost pounced. Raikō barely had time to draw her short wakizashi blade. She sliced instinctively as she threw herself on the ground, her sword swishing through the air, meeting no resistance. She felt her hackles raise as the cold ghostly form passed straight through her, and she lifted her head to see the figure walking away from the bell tower. The monk ghost barely walked ten paces before it faded.",
								"Raikō's embarrassment quickly turned to disgust. She had not paid much attention to this before, but now her whiskers were touching the stone floor, she realised it was caked with bird droppings\u2014as was her nice karuta armor. As she gingerly rose to her feet and brushed herself off, the answer came to her. The sun was rapidly descending below the mountaintops, and all that was left was to wait and see if her theory was correct."

Apart from evidence that the daitengu had lived here for a while, the search was beginning to feel like a waste of time. The benefit was that they had plenty of time to waste. At Raikō's insistence, the party had not yet reported the job as complete. It would be typical of the {@i daimyō's} office to cheat them out of their well-deserved pay, even though Raikō suspected slaying the daitengu would put an end to the nuisance. Still, she had doubts. The appearance of the monk ghost poked at the back of her mind. What caused it to linger here, rather than departing to Yomi, the land of the dead?",
								"Her deep thought was suddenly interrupted by a ruckus at the shōrō. A great cloud of feathers began to cascade down from the ceiling, and Raikō began to wonder if a kotengu had managed to slip in unnoticed. She soon had her answer as from the loft of the shōrō descended a drove of dark-feathered doves who darted about, the whirring of their wings breaking the still night air. One pigeon was clearly disorientated as it flew head-first into the bell, and the cacophony was added to by a quiet thump, followed seconds later by a much louder one.",
								"The quieter thump came as the pigeon fell to the ground and brushed itself off as if nothing had happened. The louder thump was caused by the corporealized corpse of the monk, sliding from the beams like a limp snake, now prostrate on the filthy tiles and slowly raising itself up onto its feet. Raikō and her companions watched as the monk made those same steps he had made earlier before he faded; this time, the hum of the bell was louder in Raikō's ears, and it seemed to give the monk ghost enough strength to hold onto whatever it was that was tethering him to the material plane.",
								"In this form, the monk's body looked opaque enough to touch, and Raikō recalled the sensation as he had wafted over her earlier. Clever, she thought. He must have passed through the pigeons to spook them, every night for... how long? How terrible, that he spent so many years desperately trying to get the attention of the village below.",
								"The monk led the party to the edge of the cliff and pointed at the forest below. It looked like some kind of rock-slide had occurred, but they were so high up, it was difficult to truly tell. Raikō realised they were going to have to climb down to get a better look. A foolish task in the middle of the night, but one thing Raikō had realised by working with these {@i rōnin}: foolishness gets you places."

								"Raikō let go of the kotengu's leg and prepared herself for the ground that was rushing up to meet her. She had been aiming for a patch of soft earth but, just as she shifted her body to release, the kotengu lurched sharply towards the cliffs. This was in no way ideal. Landing so close to the cliff wall would make it very difficult to break her fall with a roll. She had managed to disarm the kotengu mid-flight, but she knew it would be right on her as she landed, and if she got this wrong, she would be at the mercy of the kotengu's sharp talons.",
								"She hit the ground hard and tried to soften the impact by rolling, but as she suspected her roll was interrupted by hard rock, and she felt the wind expelled from her lungs. The kotengu lunged downwards, claws outstretched. At the last second, Raikō withdrew into her fox form, becoming a much smaller target for the kotengu's clutches. Its claws scraped across the rock-face, leaving behind a set of sharp grooves across the surface. Raikō darted into the woods, still wheezing from the impact, while the kotengu attempted to work out how it had missed.",
								"A few moments later, she heard the swoosh of an arrow and the thunk as it hit home, lodged in the kotengu's skull. Raikō emerged from the woods and stared up at her savior. The kappa Mafuke stood at the top of the cliff, bow in hand. He bowed in pride at his performance, and a little trickle of water dripped out from his skull, which Raikō traced with her eyes as it fell in the grey pre-dawn.",
								"Her daring stunt had saved a great deal of time, which she now used to inspect the area where the monk had pointed. At first it seemed there was nothing but a pile of rocks. Now she was up close, the picture was much clearer. These rocks showed the signs of a sculptor, although it was difficult to make sense of how they fitted together.",
								"The statue had clearly been jettisoned off the cliff, most likely by the tengu. No wonder the monk had such a strong tether to this world. This was a defilement of the highest offense. She wondered about the statue, and who it had represented. Strange though, she had not noticed any statues missing in the temple.",
								"Of course. This statue was not from the temple building. Moreover, this was not one statue, but two. She picked through the stones until she found the face of the left lion-dog, shortly followed by the right. She had thought it strange that no lion-dogs had been tasked with guarding the temple. This is where they were, then. Two proud guardians, reduced to rubble.",
								"She was joined a short while later by Rin the tanuki, who had found his own way down the cliff by fashioning a parachute out of god-knows-what. Rin and Raikō stood over the pieces and both knew there was little they could do. Maybe, if they could find the right pieces, Rin could go through mending the joins one-by-one. It would be tedious, and it would not necessarily restore the lion-dogs to life. However, it was their one shot at being paid for this job, and so Rin set to work while Raikō stood watch.",
								"It was late in the morning by the time Rin announced he was finished. There before them both stood two majestic lion-dogs; on the left was the a-gyō with his open mouth, and on the right was the un-gyō, her jaw clenched. Cracks were evident over the entire surface of each statue, and Rin shrugged. Neither lion-dog showed much sign of life. Still, Rin came from the tradition of wandering priests known as {@i sō}, and he took a moment to consecrate the statues, satisfied that he had done all he could.",
								"Raikō and Rin leisurely made their way back up to the temple to make their report. Raikō still held the magic slip of paper entrusted to the party by the {@i daimyō's} official. Whether she could remember the folds required to make it work was another matter. Hopefully someone in their party knew. And then, there was the tune you had to hum to bring it to life. How did it go again?",
								"Raikō stopped. She was no closer to remembering the tune, but she had a much more pertinent revelation. She burst into a sprint, leaving Rin in her wake as he attempted to keep up in his cumbersome ō-yoroi armor. They were nearly at the temple, and she needed to know if her idea would work.",
								"She ran straight past her party to the shōrō, and ignoring their questions, she lifted the hammer and struck the bell with all of her might. She felt the vibration course through her bones and she immediately let go of the hammer. As the deafening magic reverberated, translucent forms began to coalesce all around the temple. She paid them no mind. Her curiosity lay in what she might see over the edge of the cliff.",
								"She peered down to the spot where she had landed earlier. Exactly as she had thought. The lion-dogs were gone.",
								"Moments later, a fearsome beast, made of stone with gold cracks like lightning bolts painted across the surface, bounded forth and let out a mighty roar that seemed to increase the bell's intensity even further. A moment later, they were joined by another of the beasts, who joined in the chorus. Lastly, Rin followed behind, wiping his forehead and catching his breath.",
								"The monk ghost appeared at Raikō's side, and with a smile, bowed deeply. He joined a procession of ghostly forms who made their way up the stone steps into the temple, each of them giving voice to a chant that had not been sung in this region for decades. At the gate, Raikō watched as the two great beasts found their posts and settled in place.",
								"The guardians had returned."

Each family of dragons has an elder dragon {@i kami} from whom they all descend; for instance, Chinushi-sama is the dragon {@i kami} for the {@i chiryū} family (Earth dragons), and the Emperor Suinushi-sama is the dragon {@i kami} for the {@i suiryū} family (Water dragons).",
