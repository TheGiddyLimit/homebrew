A scoundrel by nature, sin calls their name, and when whispers of malefic powers reach their ears, they listen. Those powers offer more than temptation; they grant the tools to deceive, steal, and even kill with a precision these rogues never dreamed of.",

In this new afterlife, Phillip provided souls the opportunity  to be reborn as sapient mortal beings to enjoy a second chance at a \"normal\" life.",

However, he finds governance tedious and prefers to enjoy the good life he brought to the afterlife, with all the messy and sinful comforts and indulgences that come with it.",

Even worse, while in the valley, Phillip has none of the supernatural powers that make him the most formidable being in the land.",

While within the confines of the valley, Phillip is very nearly just a mortal man, which will lead to his inevitable destruction.",

His curiosity is stronger than his sense of preservation, and he cannot fathom a scenario where he could be in any real danger. He sees  the presence of the characters as an opportunity  to get to the bottom of what's happening in Wickermoor Hollow while also helping the citizens he's neglected for so long.",

On a failed save, a target has the {@condition Charmed|XPHB} condition, it can understand your commands, and it follows them on its next turn to the best of its ability. On your subsequent turns, you can take a {@action Magic|XPHB} action to issue a new command. On a successful save, a target has the {@condition Charmed|XPHB} condition until the start of your next turn, but you have no additional ability to command it. The howl is audible within 300 feet."

In this section, you will discover the thirteen primary provinces of Druskenvald, the people who call them home, and how the unique aspects of each region affect the nightly life of the locals. In addition to major features and pieces of folklore of each province, you'll gain a deeper understanding of its ruler, the witch of the Midnight Moon that terrorizes its people, and notable locations rife with opportunities for haunting adventures.",

Its sky, water, landscape, settlements, and even its people exist in a grayscale that colors every aspect of their society. The heart of Edwardia is ever pulled between two contrasting extremes, and the balance that its people maintain has allowed them to achieve a level of technological progress far beyond the wildest dreams of most of Druskenvald's inhabitants, with sprawling cities, industrious machinery, and fantastic vehicles all powered by electricity captured from the province's frequent storms. But progress has its cost, and for all the prosperity and comfort the province enjoys, there is just as much hardship and strife.",

These opposing furies have manifested into a curse that marks every inhabitant of Edwardia and hangs over the province like the dense fog from which the wolfen {@race Curseborn|CrookedMoon24}{@sup {@race Curseborn|CrookedMoon14|'14}} emerge. Managing this affliction by maintaining balance is core to life in this province of gloomy hills, moors, and flatlands, with its people divided between a towering metropolis and the quaint countryside.",

Additionally, attempts to spread the technology outside of Edwardia have failed catastrophically. Because endeavors to improve upon its design have brought the doom of the Grey upon many inventors, engineers, and scientists, the technology seems destined to remain at its current level indefinitely."

But in the process of inventing Sparktech, a catastrophic accident annihilated her body and transmuted her soul into raw electricity. Through quick thinking, she was able to bind her soul inside a suit of iron armor before her crackling new form could dissipate. This was the moment she realized that balance could be achieved by embracing both extremes of duality in equal measure instead of walking a middle ground of mediocrity.",

She acts as a ruthless inspector one night, before leading a fiery riot to the sound of raucous electric music the next. She strives to increase the province's quality of life through rampant industrial growth while accepting the sickness and suffering caused by the subsequent pollution. The Iron Maiden takes no joy in the sacrifices that must be made in the name of progress, but she places the blame on the curse that she believes forced her hand."

She seeks to rob every last inhabitant of Edwardia of their color and vivacity to amass an army of emotionless, gray drones that follow her song and spread her suffering to all of Druskenvald."

He lasted longer than any keeper has before or since, but he eventually succumbed to the delusions of the enchantment in the lamp. Hearing a siren's call out on the sea, he swam to meet it and was devoured by a Hungering One. None know what brought him back, but the next night, he returned to shore as a spirit who bore the secrets of the deep and the sight beyond the stars.",

He is typically clad in his eternally weathered captain's outfit and is mostly lucid, though he is occasionally overcome with ravings of superstitions, curses, and dangers on the horizon\u2014all of which are filled with truth and heeded by his people. This eldritch, perhaps cosmic, knowledge has allowed the people of the province to weather the numerous dangers both natural and supernatural, and his leadership continues to be invaluable in their survival."

In the quiet provincial towns that dot the rolling hills, fertile farmland, and humble woodlands, life is quite peaceful, but there is always a lurking fear of making a wrong move and straying from the Silver Path. For within the province's great cities, built from the same stone that the gargoyle-like {@race Stoneborn|CrookedMoon24}{@sup {@race Stoneborn|CrookedMoon14|'14}} are carved out of, the zealous militants of this faith seek wayward and wicked souls to judge and purge swiftly and without mercy.",
                                "Whether the people of the province walk through crowded streets or sprawling fields, they strive to keep their footfalls along the path of righteousness so they might be rewarded ascension to the blinding light of the one true god. In Pholsense society, it is paramount to put the Silver Path above neighbor, family, and self, vigilantly watching for and reporting any transgression or heresy to the inquisitors responsible for dispensing the silver justice. Magic achieved through any means other than faith is deeply distrusted, and casting the wrong spell at the wrong time can ensure a fiery fate.",

Lacking the typical trappings of personification that mortals often attribute to their gods, this deity exists as an imperceivable divine will that upholds the five holy tenets: piousness, temperance, diligence, unity, and sacrifice. There is zero tolerance for sin or apathy that affronts these virtues. Pholsense has suffered far worse from the witchcraft of the Coven of the Midnight Moon than any other province, which has only emboldened their righteous fury.",

All throughout the region, the near-constant ringing of great bells can be heard; the faithful claim this is the voice of the Silver Path and attempt to discern meaning from it. However, members of the hierarchical clergy insist only they can truly decipher the voice of their god, so they act as intermediaries with increasing authority all the way to the head of the church, Archbishop Renault.",

Conversely, it potentially makes them susceptible to other effects, such as the {@spell Protection from Evil and Good|XPHB} spell.
