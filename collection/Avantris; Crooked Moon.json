				"Despite ruling in Druskenvald for many years, he was not always the realm's master. Formerly, it had belonged to the fey goddess Kehlenn, who utilized the reincarnation magics of  the domain to rebirth souls as flora and fauna in a natural world where life was brutal and short.",

He now oversees the domain with his Crescent Court, composed of the thirteen lords and ladies of Druskenvald (see chapter 1).

While within the confines of the valley, Phillip is very nearly just a mortal man, which will lead to his inevitable destruction.",

She set off from home at a young age and eventually discovered a community in the swamp that worshipped Snake Eye Jack and held him as a beneficent spirit who made sure that luck was always on their side. She learned their ways and became a skilled jinxcraft practitioner, using her magical abilities to help the people of the bayou as well as aid her work as a trader.",
				"Now an adult, she has become a shrewd and resourceful businesswoman who has numerous contacts throughout the Drowned Crossroads and a knack for fencing stolen goods that the rogues of the swamp bring her. Her skill in business, helpful magic, and wisdom beyond her years have made her widely respected by all the folk of the swamp, and the Bayou King has appointed her as his chief advisor and emissary."

				"Golub is obsessed with not merely acquiring information, which she primarily gathers through the eyes and ears of her pigeon spies, but in controlling its flow. Every written communication in Wickermoor Village passes through her hands, and she alone decides what is passed on, withheld, or altered. She listens, watches, and whispers from her perch in the Walking Dovecote, choosing whether to deliver truths or lies that aid in her grand designs, even among the Vermintoll Coven and cult of the Crooked Queen.",
				"Preferring the comforts of town and leveraging the close proximity to the victims of her mental corruption, Golub lives among the people of Wickermoor Village disguised as {@area Theodora Mayville, the postmaster|180|x}. To ensure a more reliable and long-term disguise, she wears the skin of the person she impersonates, needing to change bodies every decade or so to avoid drawing suspicion. The one thing she cannot change between personas is the vibrant lilac eyes cast by her bewitching enchantment. When Golub uses a victim's skin, the disguise is flawless and can't be perceived as false, even through magical means, which detect her as a Humanoid. Golub also has {@variantrule Advantage|XPHB} on Charisma ({@skill Deception|XPHB}) checks while in this disguise."

Her unbound curiosity, enthusiasm, and drive, along with an obsession with the spiritual world, drew her to seek out the {@book Ghostlight Express|CrookedMoon|1|The Vagrant and the Ghostlight Express}. It is there she met Phillip, and the two fell deeply in love and were promptly married. She now assists her husband and is invaluable in the governance of Druskenvald."

One of the most prominent and famous landmarks of the city is the Dome of Cygnus, an enormous observatory said to have been built by Lunarium's founder. Numerous enchanted telescopes protrude from the structure, allowing stargazers from across Druskenvald to seek answers from the cosmos above."

But progress has its cost, and for all the prosperity and comfort the province enjoys, there is just as much hardship and strife.",
								"The society that has resulted is one obsessed with dualities\u2014life and death, good and evil, law and anarchy, wealth and poverty, peace and conflict, progress and regression, city and country. These opposing furies have manifested into a curse that marks every inhabitant of Edwardia and hangs over the province like the dense fog from which the wolfen {@race Curseborn|CrookedMoon24}{@sup {@race Curseborn|CrookedMoon14|'14}} emerge.

Those who peer into the rushing waters can see full spectral scenes playing beneath the surface in the fragmented moments of extinguished lives.",
												"This river is also the primary method of travel through Kalero and to the provinces beyond. Numerous ships of all shape, size, and construction navigate the waterways on all manner of voyages from trading to treasure hunting. However, the waters are often treacherous with sudden rapids and whirlpools, hungry river beasts, and the vicious pirates that lurk in the hidden coves throughout the bottom of the canyons."

Crooked, drab streets wind their way through gray, weather-worn buildings that are populated with folk who seem just a little off. Despite the gloomy appearance, sailors, traders, fishermen, and hunters come from all other provinces to make port before seeking the supernatural bounty of the strange tides off the coast.",
												"Amidst the salty markets and docks covered in the blood of lesser sea monsters, eldritch and occult relics, often collected from the countless sunken ruins found in the marshes of the province, are traded behind closed doors and away from prying eyes. Unsettling, rundown chapels can be found honoring the various Hungering Ones that are often surprisingly full of worshipers, driven by equal parts adoration and dread. The most infamous location in the city is the Seven Sisters tavern, known for its seafood stew and the raucous clientele of salty dogs, cutthroats, and bad eggs."

There is zero tolerance for sin or apathy that affronts these virtues. Pholsense has suffered far worse from the witchcraft of the Coven of the Midnight Moon than any other province, which has only emboldened their righteous fury.",

All throughout the region, the near-constant ringing of great bells can be heard; the faithful claim this is the voice of the Silver Path and attempt to discern meaning from it. However, members of the hierarchical clergy insist only they can truly decipher the voice of their god, so they act as intermediaries with increasing authority all the way to the head of the church, Archbishop Renault.",

His curiosity is stronger than his sense of preservation, and he cannot fathom a scenario where he could be in any real danger.

Taking the form of an enormous black goat with three blood-red eyes, The Horned King exists as an incorporeal fiendish spirit bound to the haunted {@adventure Wytchwood|CrookedMoon|17} where the Crooked Queen remains entombed and imprisoned.",

This faith is the standard belief system of the people of Wickermoor Village, and its members believe that adhering to the Old Ways has allowed for their settlement to have survived for centuries and grow to a level of relative prosperity in Wickermoor Hollow.",
												"Highly superstitious, those who revere the Old Ways bow to and seek to appease the protective and destructive sides of nature and its spirit world counterpart. The personification of the Old Ways is a primordial fey entity called the Green Queen who embodies both nature and magic. However, most worshipers do not know that the true identity of their goddess is Kehlenn, who has turned crooked after millennia of hateful imprisonment.",
												"The Followers of the Old Ways believe that survival in a world such as Druskenvald is a privilege and a miracle\u2014and never guaranteed. They accept with open arms nature's blessings as well as the utter destruction and death it can cause.",
												"To them, individual life is a tiny insignificance in the scope of the community; they are happy and willing to sacrifice themselves or others if it means honoring and appeasing the Old Ways and guaranteeing a greater existence and prosperity for the collective whole in the years to come. Most practitioners of the Old Ways perform numerous rituals in their nightly lives and always strive to listen to the elders and the wisest among them.",
												"The majority are not evil or actively attempting to serve the Crooked Queen. Only the most devout and enlightened have formed a secretive cult of the Old Ways that practices malign and forbidden magic to serve Kehlenn, the {@creature Crooked Man|CrookedMoon24}, and the Vermintoll Coven.",
												"This sect manipulates the unaware and more benevolent adherents of the Green Queen to bring about the ascension of the Crooked Queen and the eventual disintegration of all sapient life. These cultists know that they too will die but are seeking a glorious rebirth in the new crooked order of things. As soon as Phillip and Adela Druskenvald arrive in Wickermoor Hollow, they begin to advance their plans toward this end.",
												"On the surface, the benevolent symbol utilized by the general members of the Followers of the Old Ways is a feminine face made from green leaves. However, the more malign cultists who seek to unleash the Crooked Queen recognize each other by wearing or displaying the symbol of an antlered hare. This might be a tattoo, a piece of jewelry, or an actual hare foot kept somewhere on them for \"good luck.\""

There are adherents in many of the larger communities, but most of the practitioners live in remote communes in the wilds.",

They also eschew any dabbling in the spirit world or supernatural realms, considering such a thing a foolish and dangerous invitation for malevolent forces to corrupt the wilds.",
												"Its adherents still perform rituals and rites in honor of the Patient Lady, but they keep them incredibly simple and tied to the natural world around them. This can even take the form of basic meditation outdoors, a walk through the woods and fields with fellow faithful, or the utterance of a song or prayer at harvest time.",

The two older hags conspired to allow the weasel hag to be butchered in the Crooked House, but Stonoga has no idea that she herself was deceived. Golub Graygullet believed the middle sister needed to die too, as whispered by the Crooked Queen with the promise of being elevated within the inevitable crooked court of Kehlenn. Golub will aid the characters in hunting down Stonoga if she can."

But it mattered not; the young satyr had found a purpose more precious and beautiful than even the natural world.",
										"It was not long until Gwenna would pay for her naïve idealism. Less than a year after their first meeting, Farryn found her love on the forest floor, half eaten by a ravenous wolf monstrosity twisted by the malign power of {@area the Crooked Queen|021|x}. The druid drove off the beast, but it was too late. Gwenna had fed the creatures of the wood and would return to the earth, as decreed by the natural cycle. However, Farryn refused to accept Gwenna's fate, overwhelmed with the agony of loss. In this moment of defiance and rejection of the natural cycle, she heard the call of Gorthos."

These putrid remains would not return to the earth, instead enduring decay without end.",

He told Farryn of the lost eons, when {@area Kehlenn|021|x} was pure and untwisted. A time when her realm was green with renewal. Gorthos was captive in his den, just as the Crooked Queen was captive to her misguided desire for vengeance and unnatural, crooked corruption. But an Emerald Rebirth, he knew, could restore him and the queen as they were before. Gwenna would also be restored, and she and Farryn could spend an eternity together in a vibrant world of green.",
										"Farryn shared the dead god's dream and understood what she must do. Over many weeks, she ate his rotting flesh, taking in his knowledge, his power, his purpose, and his name. As she feasted, she rotted, changed, and grew. Each bite of Gorthos's decaying flesh was added to her own form until the stag was no more, and she had become a huge, putrid abomination.",

She laid Gwenna in the waters, a final offering to the god she had consumed\u2014the god she had become. As Gwenna's body submerged, the pool spoiled, spewing forth an explosive bloom of spores that would seed all life in the wood with Hartsblight.",
										"As the rot spread, she retreated to her putrid den and became one with the blight, filled with bitter hope that the death and decay of all things, even the Crooked Queen herself, would restart the natural cycle in an Emerald Rebirth. Then and only then might she see Gwenna again."
