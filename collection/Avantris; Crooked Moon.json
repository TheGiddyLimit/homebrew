In this new afterlife, Phillip provided souls the opportunity  to be reborn as sapient mortal beings to enjoy a second chance at a \"normal\" life.",

However, he finds governance tedious and prefers to enjoy the good life he brought to the afterlife, with all the messy and sinful comforts and indulgences that come with it.",

Even worse, while in the valley, Phillip has none of the supernatural powers that make him the most formidable being in the land.",

While within the confines of the valley, Phillip is very nearly just a mortal man, which will lead to his inevitable destruction.",

His curiosity is stronger than his sense of preservation, and he cannot fathom a scenario where he could be in any real danger. He sees  the presence of the characters as an opportunity  to get to the bottom of what's happening in Wickermoor Hollow while also helping the citizens he's neglected for so long.",

A variety of revelers of song exist, depending on the type of instrument a given reveler plays. Drone revelers play the hurdy gurdy and are surrounded by an accompanying swarm of bees. {@item Drum|XPHB} revelers play drums or cymbals, and the world shakes to their beat. Bell revelers play some variety of bell, chime, or gong, and the ringing overtakes all other sounds.",
