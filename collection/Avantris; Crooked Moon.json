				"Vice clings to Sinners like a second skin—cheating, drunkenness, and games of chance are their bread and blood. A scoundrel by nature, sin calls their name, and when whispers of malefic powers reach their ears, they listen. Those powers offer more than temptation; they grant the tools to deceive, steal, and even kill with a precision these rogues never dreamed of.",

Only the cold comfort of the path of sin remains.",

On a failed save, a target has the {@condition Charmed|XPHB} condition, it can understand your commands, and it follows them on its next turn to the best of its ability. On your subsequent turns, you can take a {@action Magic|XPHB} action to issue a new command. On a successful save, a target has the {@condition Charmed|XPHB} condition until the start of your next turn, but you have no additional ability to command it. The howl is audible within 300 feet."
