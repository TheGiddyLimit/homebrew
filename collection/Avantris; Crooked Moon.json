				"Despite ruling in Druskenvald for many years, he was not always the realm's master. Formerly, it had belonged to the fey goddess Kehlenn, who utilized the reincarnation magics of  the domain to rebirth souls as flora and fauna in a natural world where life was brutal and short.",

He then reshaped the land into  his own design, even renaming it after himself. In this new afterlife, Phillip provided souls the opportunity  to be reborn as sapient mortal beings to enjoy a second chance at a \"normal\" life.",

He now oversees the domain with his Crescent Court, composed of the thirteen lords and ladies of Druskenvald (see chapter 1).

While within the confines of the valley, Phillip is very nearly just a mortal man, which will lead to his inevitable destruction.",

She set off from home at a young age and eventually discovered a community in the swamp that worshipped Snake Eye Jack and held him as a beneficent spirit who made sure that luck was always on their side. She learned their ways and became a skilled jinxcraft practitioner, using her magical abilities to help the people of the bayou as well as aid her work as a trader.",
				"Now an adult, she has become a shrewd and resourceful businesswoman who has numerous contacts throughout the Drowned Crossroads and a knack for fencing stolen goods that the rogues of the swamp bring her. Her skill in business, helpful magic, and wisdom beyond her years have made her widely respected by all the folk of the swamp, and the Bayou King has appointed her as his chief advisor and emissary."

				"Just as it was her sisters' roles to corrupt the soul and body of sacrifices to the Crooked Queen, Golub corrupts her victims' minds through the control of information and magical enchantments she weaves. A malignantly proud creature, Golub views every mortal as merely a pawn, tool, or puppet to help advance her own aims, viewing her tactics of seeking, manipulating, and distributing information as far more tasteful than the more uncouth methods favored by her sisters.",
				"Golub is obsessed with not merely acquiring information, which she primarily gathers through the eyes and ears of her pigeon spies, but in controlling its flow. Every written communication in Wickermoor Village passes through her hands, and she alone decides what is passed on, withheld, or altered. She listens, watches, and whispers from her perch in the Walking Dovecote, choosing whether to deliver truths or lies that aid in her grand designs, even among the Vermintoll Coven and cult of the Crooked Queen.",
				"Preferring the comforts of town and leveraging the close proximity to the victims of her mental corruption, Golub lives among the people of Wickermoor Village disguised as {@area Theodora Mayville, the postmaster|180|x}. To ensure a more reliable and long-term disguise, she wears the skin of the person she impersonates, needing to change bodies every decade or so to avoid drawing suspicion. The one thing she cannot change between personas is the vibrant lilac eyes cast by her bewitching enchantment. When Golub uses a victim's skin, the disguise is flawless and can't be perceived as false, even through magical means, which detect her as a Humanoid. Golub also has {@variantrule Advantage|XPHB} on Charisma ({@skill Deception|XPHB}) checks while in this disguise."

Her unbound curiosity, enthusiasm, and drive, along with an obsession with the spiritual world, drew her to seek out the {@book Ghostlight Express|CrookedMoon|1|The Vagrant and the Ghostlight Express}. It is there she met Phillip, and the two fell deeply in love and were promptly married. She now assists her husband and is invaluable in the governance of Druskenvald."

One of the most prominent and famous landmarks of the city is the Dome of Cygnus, an enormous observatory said to have been built by Lunarium's founder. Numerous enchanted telescopes protrude from the structure, allowing stargazers from across Druskenvald to seek answers from the cosmos above."

But progress has its cost, and for all the prosperity and comfort the province enjoys, there is just as much hardship and strife.",
								"The society that has resulted is one obsessed with dualities\u2014life and death, good and evil, law and anarchy, wealth and poverty, peace and conflict, progress and regression, city and country. These opposing furies have manifested into a curse that marks every inhabitant of Edwardia and hangs over the province like the dense fog from which the wolfen {@race Curseborn|CrookedMoon24}{@sup {@race Curseborn|CrookedMoon14|'14}} emerge.

This prominent waterway forged Kalero, not just by shaping the landscape to its running course, but also by intertwining the region with the essence of memory. The great river's waters contain the lingering memories of souls lost to the Shroud and are all that remain of who they once were. Those who peer into the rushing waters can see full spectral scenes playing beneath the surface in the fragmented moments of extinguished lives.",
												"This river is also the primary method of travel through Kalero and to the provinces beyond. Numerous ships of all shape, size, and construction navigate the waterways on all manner of voyages from trading to treasure hunting. However, the waters are often treacherous with sudden rapids and whirlpools, hungry river beasts, and the vicious pirates that lurk in the hidden coves throughout the bottom of the canyons."
