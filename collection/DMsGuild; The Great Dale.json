The leader of the circle, usually the most powerful or experienced caster, stands within a circle formed by the other casters, who are no more than 10 feet from each other. Up to five casters can aid the leader, though stories exist of powerful Red Wizards employing twice that number.",

This results in the circle leader receiving a final pool of Circle Magic energy totaling (2) 1st, (1) 2nd and (1) 3rd level spell slot.",

The discovery that she could shapeshift came in her early teens when she fell in love with a human girl named Julia.",
					"For a time they were inseparable. They loved exploring their small town together, which was close enough to trade routes that strange travelers would occasionally pass through. One day a drunk visitor followed the two girls as they explored, hoping to rob them. Alyssa somehow knew his intentions and told Julia to run.",
					"Alyssa stood fast as the man demanded her necklace. It was precious to her\u2014it had once belonged to her mother. She was furious that he would demand something that wasn't his. Her mind was a storm of anger and fear; she feared for hers and Julia's safety.",
					"Alyssa's body convulsed. Her physical form transformed into the shape of her father, Lorimar. In this new form, she scratched and kicked at the man who was too drunk to fight back. He stumbled, hitting his head on a rock. He didn't move and Alyssa ran home. As she ran, she realized her body had changed. On arriving home, a mirror in her room shared the truth. She fell asleep cowering in a corner, trying desperately to stay in control.",
					"Later that night she awoke to loud banging. A glance in the mirror revealed her normal appearance. Her father, Vanovar, opened the front door to a visitor, who claimed Lorimar was dead at the hands of bandits. The bandits had attacked Lorimar, claiming he had killed one of their own. Though Lorimar denied he had done this, they refused to listen and killed him.",
					"The visitor said the bandits were known as the \"Thirsty Dogs,\" and that they terrorized travelers on the roads leading to Thay. The visitor said he was from Thay and had lost someone dear to him as well to these thugs. He promised Vanovar and Alyssa that he would hunt the bandits down and make them pay for what they had done.",
					"Alyssa believes it was her fault that her father died and has never forgiven herself. It is a secret she keeps to this day.",

					"When Myth Drannor was first constructed, Lossarwyn was a powerful elf druid who viewed the spread of humanity as an evil taint upon Faerûn. He traveled the Realms seeking out places afflicted with the plague, where his vast knowledge and medical expertise helped save many lives. Secretly, his true aim was not to cure the sick, but to find a virulent plague that would cleanse the land of humanity.",
					"After years of research he appeared to be nearing a breakthrough that would create a deadly disease, finally eradicating humankind. However, a jealous rival discovered his secret and Lossarwyn was forced to flee from a trio of powerful druids who sought to end his madness. His pursuers finally trapped Lossarwyn within the icy caverns of a glacier. After a terrible battle, they killed Lossarwyn trapping him beneath impenetrable ice. Before Lossarwyn died, he whispered a dread pact with fiendish forces and was transformed into an undead creature.",
					"Centuries later, Lossarwyn was freed from his icy prison within the glacier. He continued his quest to find the plague. After joining with an evil cabal of wizards, they too discovered his secret, and though they could not defeat the elvish lich, they trapped him within the confines of the Dire Wood, free to travel within, but never to escape to the rest of Faerûn.",
					"Recently, members of Eldreth Veluuthra discovered the lich's location. After much effort, they succeeded in circumventing the arcane protections trapping the lich by having him travel through the Abyss to arrive within one of the many demoncysts buried beneath the Great Dale. Though Lossarwyn still cannot set foot within Faerûn outside of the Dire Wood, he is free to travel to any of the demoncysts under the ancient lands of Narfell. Lossarwyn is now invigorated and working feverishly with the Eldreth Veluuthra to create the disease that has eluded him for so long."

The hagspawn was an oppressive ruler for many years until the Year of the Sceptered One (1404 DR) when the hero of Spearsmouth Dale, Lord Abraer Thellblade, arrived with his companions to dispose of the tyrant. Unfortunately for Lord Abraer, he woefully underestimated Vosthor and his collection of ruffians. In the course of a tenday, the hagspawn had killed Lord Abraer and gained control of Spearsmouth Dale as well.",
					"Vosthor was careful to avoid offending the Circle of Leth and thus ruled both dales with an iron fist for decades until his fear of mortality changed his focus. Seeking ways to extend his existence, he became a follower of Orcus, hoping to learn the secret to surviving as an undead being. The demon lord was happy to gain a new powerful thrall and transformed Vosthor into an undead creature under his control.",
					"Once transformed, Vosthor retreated from public view, handing control of Spearsmouth Dale and Mettledale to one of his bugbear lieutenants. Seeking long-term stability, Vosthor directed his lieutenants to ally themselves with the Shadowmasters of Telflamm. The criminal organization was happy to oblige, and have helped the hagspawn control the region in the years since.",
					"Behind the scenes, Vosthor now follows the directions of Orcus and seeks to set up new cults to the Lord of Undeath across Thesk and the Great Dale. Orcus would like nothing more than to utterly eliminate the Demon Lord Eltab, who is currently trapped in Eastern Faerûn. He may direct Vosthor to seek out powerful heroes, warn them of the dangers Eltab presents to the region, and guide them in their task in destroying one of Orcus's rivals."
