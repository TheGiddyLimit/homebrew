First, by extending the life of the halflings by a hundred years or so, hoping that this extended time would ease their pain before the unending sleep. To their dismay, it only prolonged the inevitable. The Aspects continued to experiment, extending the life of dwarves, gnomes, elves, and lastly the wyverians far beyond that of humans, but they found it was not within their power to extend the life of the first races indefinitely, but they could mold it. Death was not the end, but instead it was the beginning and end of a cycle. When a creature died, the Aspects welcomed the first races and all other creations of the five to the Outer Planes where they remained until they were infused with new life and returned to the material plane. This is commonly referred to as \"The Wheel.\"",
										"But the Wheel was flawed. Unknown to the Aspects, the twisting and contorting of the Five's original creation had corrupted it. This corruption slowly seeped into the pores of the Outer Plane, forming the Fatalis, the lord of the newly formed Lower Planes. Thought to be created by the mixing of energy between Limbo, the Abyss, and the Nine Hells the Fatalis sought to destroy and recreate in its own image. In the beginning it started small, first influencing small monsters making them rabid and territorial. The harmony of nature had been broken, but the Aspects did not take notice. their concern for the first races blinded them to small changes in the world. As the wheel turned, the Fatalis grew in power and began twisting and contorting the monsters under its command into the first demons.",
										"Next it moved its sights to the first races, offering power and knowledge to the weakest of them. The ones who accepted the Fatalis's offer became the first devils. The ones who attempted to resist the Fatalis but failed, were twisted into the monstrous races like the orcs, goblins, or kobolds.",
										"The Aspects looked on in horror as these abominations to nature invaded the Five's creation. Monsters and humanoids alike were being slaughtered, forests were burning, mountains were demolished, and seas became sand. The War of the Ancients had begun."

They taught them how to harness the nature around them to fight, how to bend the earth to their will, use the bodies of fallen monsters to strengthen themselves,harness the destructive power of the magic they possessed, and work with the uncorrupted monsters of the world. A century went by, but inch by inch the monsters and first races forged ahead together.

With hope wanning, the first races once again turned to the Aspects again, praying for assistance.",

In doing so they would weaken themselves, but it was what was required. And so, the Aspects called upon the most faithful, wise, and powerful of the first races and ascended them to godhood. These lesser pantheons of gods took to the battlefield against the Archdevils and Demonlords pushing them back into the Nine Hells and the Abyss. The Aspects themselves took the fight to the Fatali's lair where they sealed Fatalis away, preventing it from ever physically leaving its lair for eternity, but at the cost of the first Aspect Io's life.",

Whenever one side would win a battle, the other would counter attack somewhere else, canceling out the territory each gain.

After much discussion and a bit of influence by Fatalis, the decision was made to begin hunting the monsters throughout the world. Waiting for them to die was too slow and would only ever be enough for repairs.",

Because of this, many of the species were left on the brink of extinction. This wanton destruction of the their kin angered the dragons. No longer would they sit idly by and let their kind be killed or be used as mere cattle. It was time to break away from the ancients who had forgotten the rules of nature, and destroy them.",

In an attempt to weaken the Aspects army, Fatalis sent an aspect of itself to destroy the kingdom of Schrade. The material plane became the battle field for all sides.

This began a long, violent war between the ancients, dragons, devils, and demons that spread worldwide, leaving behind mass destruction just about everywhere.",

Besides hunting, some wyverians became merchants and began to take requests from people to do certain things, such as gathering mushrooms or mining for rare ore. The main reason why the wyverians started hunting is because the other races were defenseless against the harsh monsters that haunted many areas, due to the Platinum's Court decision to limit the knowledge they passed down.

To dragonborn, honor was more than a word and was often considered more important than life itself. Cowardice was not simply undesirable among dragonborn, it was considered outright repulsive.",

The draconic nature of dragonborn gave them a strong self-consciousness and a tendency for strong emotions. Both of these combined to make dragonborn particularly wanting for the approval of others. Dragonborn placed great value on the skill of an individual, including themselves. Failing at a task was anathema to dragonborn and as a result they could sometimes push themselves to unhealthy extremes of effort. This aspect of the dragonborn mind meant few of the race took a laid-back approach to any skill or ability, striving always to become the masters of a particular skill, and dragonborn respected those among other races who approached life in the same manner. As a result, most dragonborn adventurers came to their way of life through a desire to prove themselves and win respect from their brethren."

										"Power hungry, unworthy, untrustworthy scoundrels, and abomination are many of the words that the races of the world used to describe the ancient tieflings. Created when a cult of teostra, shunned by the gods for their power hungry nature, began experimenting in an attempt to ascend by themselves. After numerous failed attempts, their leader cried out to the gods every night, begging for an answer, until he finally received one. Unknowingly under the guidance of the newly manifested Fatalis, the cultist succeeded in their endeavor, but not before killing their beloved teostra and completing the ritual by injecting its blood into their veins.",
										"These first tieflings had a more beastial look similar to the teostra. They had a fiery coloration, thick horns that curve backwards, large fangs, and a tail that ended in a clump of fur. The males had long flowing red hair and a beard that resembled the teostra's flowing mane. Female tieflings' hair varied in length and the hair between their horns was varying shades of yellow.",
										"Though they had ascended, they had committed an unspeakable act. Killing an elder dragon during this point in history was tantamount to attacking one of the Five themselves. The tieflings were forced to live as outlanders in small communities, or as hermits, but their allure of ascension brought those who felt ignored by the gods to their ranks. The tieflings continued to experiment with other elder dragon blood on the humans that came to them, creating new tieflings of all different colors and abilities. Their continual killing of the elder dragons did not go unnoticed. The Fifth Aspect, Eldath, sensed the blasphemy and the growing threat of the tieflings. So with the help of the other 4 Aspects, the tieflings were banished to the Lower Planes and the ritual was lost to the ages.",
										"The tieflings did not return to the material plane until the Great Dragon War. Their time in the Lower Planes had changed their appearance to the commonly known demonic look of today. Many of the tieflings fought in the archdevils armies, but tieflings were no longer predisposed to evil or power hungry as they once were. Those that sought to defect took the chance to escape and fight on the side of the Platinum Court and Wild Lords, who allowed them to remain on the material plane after the war had ended.",
										"Although their evil ancestors could be many generations removed, the taint lingered. Tieflings tend to have an unsettling air about them, and most people are uncomfortable around them, whether they are aware of the tiefling's unsavory ancestry or not.",
										"When these prejudices were put aside, the tieflings' cunning and personal allure, which made them excellent deceivers, also made them inspiring leaders. Members of other races find that once they demonstrate friendship and trust towards a tiefling, it would quickly be reciprocated in full. Once that bond was forged, it was rarely broken."

								"With all the information you have read above, let's give an example of what you might see at the start of your game and how it all works.",
								"Conrad is a level 2 fighter who has just killed his first {@creature great jagras|MHMM} (p.68 MHMM) He is currently wielding a common {@item great sword|AGMH}, wearing {@item chain mail|PHB} (that he got with his starting equipment), and has a tiny silver icon of a raven (his {@item Trinket|PHB}) attached to his belt.",
								"Being excited over his first kill, Conrad attempts to carve the great jagras to obtain some materials he might be able to use. The GM then looks up the great jagras in the Monster Hunter Loot Table PDF to see how many carves Conrad will get to attempt on the creature. In this case we can see the great jagras's loot table below. Looking at the top of the table, Conrad gets two attempts at carving this creature (He would have also gotten two rolls on the capture table should he have captured it).",
								"Next we need to determine the DC of the carve check. In this case the difficulty is a DC 12 (10 + 1/2 of the creatures CR rounded down). So Conrad makes his first Wisdom ({@skill Survival}) check and rolls a 13! A success, and on a success we roll a d20. Conrad rolls a 14 which we compare to the carve chance section of the loot table. A 14 gets Conrad a Great Jagras Mane which is an armor material that makes it so you no longer need to eat or drink.",
								"On Conrad's second carve attempt he rolls another Wisdom ({@skill Survival}) check and rolls a 9. With the carve DC being 12 he fails the second carve attempt. Just because Conrad failed, doesn't mean he does not get anything, instead a failure results in you rolling a 1 on the creature's loot table. For his second item Conrad gets a great jagras scale which gives a +2 bonus to {@skill Intimidation} checks when placed into an armor slot. With the hunt complete, Conrad returns to the guild and reports his success.",
								"At the guild he wants to make use of the materials he has just obtained, but he realizes there is one issue. Both materials he gathered are both armor materials and his common chainmail only has 1 slot. He has to choose which material to place into his armor. After some thought and deliberation, Conrad decides to place the great jagras mane into his armor, so that he no longer needs to eat or drink while he is attuned to this armor.",
								"He then places the great jagras scale material into his trinket, because it can hold either 1 armor or weapon material in it. This way he can always have the great jagras scale effect when he needs to be a bit more intimidating. He can also then replace the great jagras scale with a stronger material once he finds one he prefers.",
								"{@i Hopefully this walkthrough of the process helps answer any questions you might have. The one thing I will note is that the great jagras is a lower CR creature and as such most of its materials have common magical effects, but as you start to kill stronger and more difficult creatures you will begin to see more powerful materials that you can socket into your armor, trinket, and weapons.}",

												"Yes, and at that moment, I spied the gently swaying stalks of a Dragon Seed plant between tall plumes of volcanic smoke! I took some and combined it to make Dragon Ammo. I remembered what you said, Instructor, that no matter how strong they are against dragon element, if you shoot between the plates of its shell... This was our last shot!",
												"Gunfire, explosions, roars... It's all a big blur. But the next thing I clearly remember is all of us walking back into camp. Wounded all over, we piled into the boat that would take us home. I took this time to further examine the ancient stones I'd found. There is a sort of ancient text carved on them, but I have no idea what it says.",

That's why I've decided that from now on, I will go on research trips and practicals with you, and only you, Instructor. Carpe diem!",

Khezu feet lack claws, and instead have suction pad-like toes to assist them in climbing and hanging from cave walls and ceilings. Spending most of their lives in the dark, their eyes have regressed greatly, though they make up for this with a superb sense of smell. A layer of fat helps to keep them warm and prolong the time they can spend hunting for food. Khezu have an extendable neck which allows them to grasp and ambush prey from afar, such as from a cave ceiling. Khezu are hermaphrodites, which means an individual is both male and female. To reproduce they paralyze a creature and inject their young, known as Whelps. The Whelps grow inside their victim until it dies, or when they are strong enough to leave.",
					"Although Khezu are cave dwellers, they go out when they please, or when food inside grows too scarce. While Khezu outside a cave are vulnerable to larger Wyverns like Tigrex, inside caves Khezu have the advantage. In addition to being unhampered by the dark, they can cling to the ceiling and attack from above.",
					"A Khezu's habitat is often located near active sources of water; some sources claim this is because the water is excellent for conducting electricity into their prey, while others speculate that Khezu may need the dampness for their moist skin. Such areas include swamps and oceanside caves."

I didn't have Zuri make a perception check to find the fruit, instead the Strength check either allowed her to gather as many as she wanted for the meal or perhaps on a failed save, they aren't ripe, already rotting when she gets to them, or they are on small thin branches preventing her from getting more than few of them. Most importantly, passing or failing on a single check does not matter. What matters is if Zuri succeeded well enough overall to pass the meals check DC.",

Say she failed on her strength but succeeded on both the intelligence and constitution checks. Narratively it could be described as Zuri struggling to find enough fruit for the meal, but made up for its missing component by adjusting the recipe and taking the meal off the fire a little earlier than normal to deal with this challenge.",
						"On a failed check, Zuri was unable to create the meal as she had planned, this could be due to a lack of fruit she was able to obtain, her recipe was incorrect, or perhaps she removed it from the fire too soon.
