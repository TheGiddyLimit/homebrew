				"This necromantic concoction looks, smells and tastes like an average quality wine, albeit with a faint hint of decayed flesh.",
				"If you examine the wine carefully, a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals the faint hint of decayed flesh tainting the wine. A DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check reveals that the wine has signs of necromantic magic. A successful DC 10 Intelligence (Alchemist's Supplies) check as part of an analysis of the wine will reveal it contains poison and some other elements. An {@spell identify|PHB} spell will reveal its true nature.",
				"Ten minutes after you drink the zombie wine, which typically comes in a wine bottle holding six doses, you must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw (per dose consumed). On a failed save, you take 6 ({@damage 1d12}) poison damage and are Poisoned for 24 hours. On a successful save, you take half damage and are not Poisoned.",
				"If you die within 24 hours of drinking zombie wine, your corpse animates as an uncontrolled zombie. Zombie wine is believed to have been first distilled by a priest of Durakor who was a vintner before his conversion."
