The meat is tough enough to dull typical iron knives, and so many pre-cook the meat in a slow cooker to tenderize it, then grill it afterword. This is also done because the temperatures needed to properly cook the meat is higher than most, near the melting point of iron, and as such it is often cooked in blacksmith's furnaces. However once properly prepared it is a delicious and rich smoky flavor which 'tastes like chicken'. Care is needed in cooking. If undercooked the eater suffers as if they had been exposed to the achaierai black cloud ability.

In addition, the drinker loses all memory of events that transpired during the 10 minutes directly following consumption of a draught of icecap ale; a successful DC 18 Constitution save negates this memory loss. Additional doses of icecap ale imbibed during the hour following an initial dose cause the drinker to become poisoned for 10 minutes (instead of gaining a bonus to Strength and Constitution) and to suffer all the negative effects of icecap ale."

Failure to meet this immediately puts the consumer into a state of complete agony where they temporarily suffer moderate to large penalties to all attributes depending on how cruel the GM feels like being (and probably how much they tried to drink) and also take physical damage based on how badly they failed.
