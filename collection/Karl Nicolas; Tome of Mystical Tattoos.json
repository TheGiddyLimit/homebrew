Five stakes have already been torn from the ground. While anchored to the floor, she is restrained. A creature can spend one minute to make a DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check, removing a stake on a success. The magical chains can be disarmed with dispel magic or by using the key, which is held by Bayo, the {@creature mage|MM} on the rooftop (area 13). While bound in shackles and chains, Asseo cannot wield weapons, however, she can use the Shield Bash action by shoulder-checking creatures.",

										"The practice adopted by tattooists for distributing their magic tattoos is simple and permits them to benefit from their work, while still allowing for tattoos to be widely accessible. Magic tattoos are initially sketched within the pages of an enchanted sketchbook by a tattooist. After the design is drawn on an enchanted sketchbook page, any individual may extract that tattoo into an empty needle using tattooist's tools. This allows designs to be more easily distributed or acquired. The page is empty once the design is extracted, but a special needle is now ready to be applied.",
										"The creator's whims often drive the initial design, but this can be steered by other individuals requiring a particular result. Some would say that this is what sets magic tattoos apart from other magic items. The degree of control that tattooists have over their designs while applying their artistry and magics often yields truly remarkable results, limited only by their skill and imagination."

The chisel contains a simple mechanism that can twist to clasp onto needles of various widths. The hammer can act as an activator when it strikes the chisel, temporarily applying a magnetic property unique to magically-imbued inks into the needle.",
										"One of the main uses of tattooist's tools in regards to magic tattoos is extraction. An individual holds the chisel affixed with an empty needle against an {@item enchanted sketchbook|ToMT} page or skin upon which a magic tattoo is applied. The wielder then taps the opposite end of the chisel, drawing the tattoo design inside of the affixed, empty needle.",
										"The tattooist's tools also include plenty of needles and medical supplies for sterilization. This is necessary in case the tattooist's tools are used to apply mundane tattoos as well. For non-magical tattoo applications, the chisel's needle can be dipped into the appropriate pigments and then hammered against an individual's skin, scales, or feathers to ink a tattoo."

										"The design slowly flows from the needle into the skin upon contact, molding itself to suit the individual's body. An applied tattoo appears as it did on its sketchbook page, retaining the visual properties of the ink used when it was sketched. In this way, the design transitions from page to person through a needle.",
										"For unusual skin types, the tattoo will often take on a different form. As an example, a creature covered in fur or feathers might witness the tattoo take shape as markings as it leaves the needle. A creature with a metallic exterior might see the tattoo engrave itself onto their shell. As a tattoo is simply another form of magic item, this can be interpreted as the attunement process.",
										"The process to end attunement to a magic tattoo is different from the process to end attunement to a normal magic item. A creature other than the one to whom the tattoo is applied must use tattooist's tools and an empty needle to extract the tattoo from the skin, as it was once extracted from a tattooist's sketchbook page."

You will find that tattoos ranging drastically in rarity and power can be of the same proportion.",
										"Also of note, magic tattoos that are applied on the same body part can coexist. All magic tattoos can be layered upon each other, with individuals not having to fear for their properties being tainted or diminished. Magic tattoos are sketched with purpose, and are not so easily disrupted simply by their proximity to one other.

In response, Quid began to focus on a younger audience, knowing that children would bring their parents, and the parents, their purses. Unfortunately, the demands of entertaining children who constantly asked to hear the same songs and stories repeated ad nauseum was a wearying task. The magical properties of this tattoo allowed the bard to have his music repeated with no effort on his part, aside from passing around the collection plate."

Instead of devouring the child, they took pity on her and brought her to the oldest tree in the forest, where she was given a gift. A seed was placed in her mouth, where it sprouted vines that wrapped and twisted around her neck. Once set, they allowed her to feel the consciousness that flowed through all living things. As she grew older and eventually left the woods, she would give birth to a child who bore the same mark, eventually catching the eye of a curious tattooist."

					"There was once a young boy who enjoyed collecting rocks. One day, he found a piece of volcanic glass made up of twenty equal facets. Moments afterwards, a group of older boys approached and began to bully him. He wished that he was bigger and stronger than all of them, and was instantly transformed into a giant. The other boys ran away in fear, but soon returned with a crowd that carried pitchforks and bows. The boy then wished for a tougher skin to defend himself and found his skin turning to stone. The crowd, more frightened than ever, readied for attack. Anticipating this, the boy held the rock tight and wished to be the king, and as he changed in front of their eyes, he used his newfound confidence and appearance to convince them all to leave him be. Making one more wish, he asked for the rock to be bound to him forever. Years later, a historian who discovered a portrait of the king would bring the artwork to a mystical tattoo parlor\u2014noticing a large mark upon the king's chest."

Delighted at the discovery, he recorded the symbols suspended in this way. After sharing the symbols with his trusted colleagues, they experimented with transcribing them into various other formats. Rendering them into tattoos proved to be most successful, allowing bearers to briefly tug on the strands of time and alter fate."

					"Legend speaks of a wealthy noblewoman named Valeria Holliver who lost her husband and son when their ship was attacked by ruthless pirates. The noblewoman, upon hearing of her family's demise, sold her home and most of her worldly possessions. She used her earnings to hire a crew and buy a ship with the goal of enacting vengeance upon those who took her loved ones away.",
					"The crew was an eclectic array of seafarers, among which was an old tattooist-sailor. The ship, which came to be known as the Howling Maiden, spent several years sailing the seas, defending smaller ships from pirate attacks, rescuing sea creatures in harm's way, and protecting the ecosystem. Sea life flourished under the watchful eye of the Howling Maiden, and slowly Valeria's heart warmed to a new purpose: to protect those who could not protect themselves.",
					"After many years as captain of the ship, Valeria commissioned the tattooist-sailor to create a design that she could bear as a symbol of her commitment to the seas. Inspired by the good work they had done, the tattooist made a full-body suit to symbolize Valeria's strength and guardianship. He would later remark that it felt as though his hand was being guided as he crafted the tattoo. Once applied, Valeria quickly realized the tattoo came with divine properties, blessed in recognition of the noblewoman's stewardship over the goddess' domain."

The warrior soon discovered that his markings came with great power, and eventually, a union was granted between the son of the ocean and the daughter of the sky."

The mother managed to join the ranks of the port's street merchants and earned a living weaving baskets, while her growing son took on odd jobs from street vendors, adventurers, and passing sailors.",

He became a fond fixture at the port as he grew into a young man, making friends with several vendors, one of whom was an aging tattooist. One day, the street merchants were being harassed by bandits hired by the mother's old clan. The corrupt clan was attempting to assert themselves as \"keepers of law and order\" in the area, and demanded that the port inhabitants start paying a tax for their protection. As the merchants weighed their options, the tattooist was visited by Alo himself. He directed the tattooist to give \"the boy of pureness and brass\" his mark and blessing. The tattooist convinced Brun to take on the markings of Alo, and Brun's eyes glowed once more. He stood up to the bandits and the clan, using the tattoo's power to defend the port from their advances whenever they grew too bold."
