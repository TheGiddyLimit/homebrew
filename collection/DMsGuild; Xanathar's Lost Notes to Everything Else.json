It bears foul cargo: intellect devourers that he plans to smuggle into the villas of Nyanzaru's merchant princes, starting with Jobal, the merchant prince he bribed for safe passage into Nyanzaru. One by one, the devourers will take over the minds of the princes, turning them into puppets of the Xanathar Guild.",

				"This silver ladle was created by a dwarven cook named Tromberd, who acted as a cook for a successful adventuring party. As an acolyte of Moradin, Tromberd combined his divine, metalworking, and culinary skills to take his profession to new heights. He created a magical ladle that imbued the meals it made with magical healing properties. While the name and exploits of the adventuring company was lost to the ages, Tromberd's magical ladle has survived and continues to serve astounding and magical meals.",
				"When the ladle is used to cook a pot of soup or stew for at least 2 hours of constant stirring, the meal becomes magical food that can feed up to 8 creatures. The meal must contain at least 20 gp worth of ingredients, including rare herbs and spices. If the meal is eaten as part of a long rest, the number of hit dice recovered by the creatures eating the meal at the end of the long rest increases by 2 (to the creature's normal maximum). The creatures also gain 10 temporary hit points at the end of that long rest. Once used, the ladle's magic can't be used again until a week passes. The creature who cooks the meal can't gain the magical benefits of the food."

Recruiting one is an entirely different matter, as most deal exclusively with other genies and extraplanar beings. Yet, it is possible for a diligent mortal to gain one's trust and obedience, and their patience is greatly rewarded in both friendship and power.",

Such gen take pride in their association to the warlock as much as, or more than, the warlock might. Should their warlock miss the first opportunity to introduce their gen, it will likely take the next instant upon itself.",

In fact, each gen believes that their power grows faster the more they accomplish with a single entity, and thus the greater each ascension may be.",

All things important to the gen hinge on this relationship, as each hopes that someday they may grow to know absolute power and prestige, rivaling the gods, as only a true noble genie can."
