If the object is being worn by a creature (like a helm or a chain shirt), the creature makes the same Strength saving throw but has advantage on the roll. On a failure, the creature is pulled up to 60 feet toward you if it is Medium-size or smaller.",

				"Once you have moved an object to your space with this spell, you have advantage on saving throws and opposed rolls against effects that would cause you to drop it, and creatures seeking to move the item from your space have disadvantage on rolls to do so.
