								"Amphibios is a swampy, low-lying valley covering approximately 100,000 acres (156 square miles) of territory between two small, human-dominant kingdoms. Most of Amphibios' settlements consist of minority amphibious and reptilian races such as frogfolk, kobold, lizardfolk, serpentfolk, and toadfolk. Although humans call the land Amphibios, its residents know it as Laterreprosp.",

										"Laterreprosp's history started long before the human kingdoms claimed the lands to the south and north. Thousands of years ago, a trio of three green dragon brothers settled the area between {@area Vasteloc|location-vasteloc|x} and Lake Lebonke, the two significant bodies of water that comprise most of the region. Each dragon built and managed its stronghold, dividing the land into three sections.",
										"Entixiir, the strongest of the three brothers, built his lair on the northern shores of {@area The Murk|location-murk|x}. From this site rose the frog and toadfolk city of {@area Oudaarde|location-oudaarde|x}, which is still the largest settlement in Laterreprosp today.",
										"Joshtinovivesh, the most charismatic of the three, built his lair just east of The Murk in a muddy hollow called Dragontooth Burrows. Dragontooth Burrows still exists today and is inhabited by Joshinovivesh's greedy, diabolical grandson, Acridaethruix.",
										"Dralzos, the wisest of the three, built his lair in the foothills of the valley's western edger, an area now known as the {@area Chatsdown Slopes|location-chatsdown|x}. Dralzos terrorized the region from this lair, which he named the Labyrinth of Skulls, for a few hundred years before a band of adventurers entered the Labyrinth and slew him. Today, brutish cliff giants claim the Labyrinth as their own.",
										"As the three dragons' hoards grew and lairs expanded, they used sorcery to develop servitor races. They used the local wildlife, particularly the reptiles and frogs common in the area. Entinxiir transformed the frogs and toads at the north end of Laterreprosp into roobles (frogfolk) and ruglunks (toadfolk) (see the appendix). And Joshtinovivesh created rangols (see the appendix), an almost alchemical hybrid of kobolds, toads, and frogs capable of withstanding sunlight. Roobles, ruglunks, and rangols are collectively referred to as ruun (pronounced the same as \"rune\"). Dralzos attracted traditional kobolds and serpentfolk to his mysterious lair, modifying them only slightly to withstand his poisonous exhalations.",
										"Eventually, Dralzos died, scattering the loyal serpentfolk and kobolds who served him. Few traditional kobolds and serpentfolk remain in Laterreprosp and typically survive meagerly as mad cultists or hermetic druids that still worship Dralzos as a god.",
										"Entixiir grew bored of overseeing a kingdom and fled, seeking new interests. He left the roobles and ruglunks to fend for themselves. In the absence of their tyrant, the roobles and ruglunks built Oudaarde into a grand city.",
										"But for every rooble or ruglunk are three rangols, who remain primarily in The Murk in eastern Laterreprosp. The rangols are almost universally devout followers of Joshtinovivesh and, by extension, his grandson Acridaethruix. As a result, the rangols are more than happy to help carry out the final green dragon's ambitions of claiming all of Laterreprosp as his own."

										"When Dralvos died and Entixiir fled Amphibios, Joshtinovivesh wisely laid low for hundreds of years. The dragon feared adventurers would seek him in his burrow, slay him, and steal his hard-earned treasure, much like they had to Dralvos. He used his rangols to create false haunts all over the realm to distract and annoy would-be heroes. In time, history forgot Joshtinovivesh; the dragon died fat and forgotten. Joshtinovivesh had six children, each with their own lairs and holdings in other parts of the land. Those who survived to adulthood had spawn of their own. And from one of those nests came the dragon Acridaethruix, one of the nastiest, serpentlike dragons ever to set foot in the land. Curious about his ancestry, Acridaethruix sought his grandfather's domain, a quest that took the dragon over 50 years. Eventually, Acridaethruix discovered Dragontooth Burrow, his grandfather's withered corpse, and the massive treasure lode hidden within. Acridaethruix also discovered the rangols, who, despite being dozens of generations removed from Joshtinovivesh's rule, immediately recognized their new master.",
										"With newfound wealth and power, Acridaethruix set his sights on Laterreprosp other ancient dragon kingdoms, those belonging to his great uncles. However, in the time since Entixiir left Amphibios, Entixiir's minions, the roobles and ruglunks, became a power unto themselves. The roobles and ruglunks of {@area Oudaarde|location-oudaarde|x} used forgotten tomes hidden in Entinixiir's abandoned libraries as a guideline for humanoid society. They developed agriculture, currency, government, technology, and trade. Today, they practice a form of feudalism, where a Royal Court claims Laterreprosp as its domain. As soon as Acridaethruix set his minions out to claim Amphibios, he found his efforts swiftly repelled by the well-organized Ourdaardians. The conflict continues between the dragon and the Ourdaardians, evolving from simple martial engagements into battles of intrigue and politics which those in the know nicknamed \"Croaks and Hisses.\""

The people of Oudaarde adopted the feudalistic ways of the older kingdoms, believing that it was the best way forward for their people.",

Curved canals crisscross throughout the city, connecting the upper city's most important buildings. Tall, foundational pillars extend from the bottom of Lake Lebonke up to the surface, allowing structures to be built above and below the waterline using them as a base. The Oudaardians offer ways for non-swimmers to move throughout the upper city. Long gondolas woven from swamp reeds slip through the waterways with ease while ferries built upon the backs of the city's giant geese travel along the lake's banks, their warning honks heard for miles around.",

The palace rises from the bottom of the lakebed to extend high above the water's surface, creating a central structure at the city's center.

Heroes offer their services for adventuring needs while bodyguards offer to protect warehouses holding valuables. Because there are no laws preventing illegal products, it's also a good place to store and trade items other settlements would deem \"black market\" goods.

Happy to continue their age-old games, Duvra humors the venerable pirate and tricks the old man by transforming into various gulls, rats, and even fish that whisper nonsensical riddles to him when no one else is there to see. Some wonder what old Huik would even do if he caught the dragon. Would he actually try and kill Duvra? Or would he turn the other way, recognizing that Duvra might be the only purpose driving him in his twilight years?

Half-dryads, being the result of intense love affairs, are exceedingly rare; no two are alike, though many have an innate tendency toward romance, having witnessed firsthand their parents' love for one another.

A dryad discovers a wandering druid in her grove, and follows them out of curiosity, having never seen such a creature. Though the details vary, the theme remains the same: where the weed of fear is torn, radical love emerges. Sproutlings are the manifestation of that love.

Sproutlings born of the archfey's curse tend to stay closer to home than others, forgoing their humanoid freedom to aid their mother in the forest's protection. Quests of vengeance, too, are not uncommon: a dryad may have a child not out of love, but out of a vicarious desire for freedom and revenge, and groom them into a fierce warrior for that expressed purpose.

Their skin retains moisture easily, allowing them to thrive in drier environments better than roobles. Naturally, this combination of patience and fortitude lends itself to finding meaningful work as farmers, masons, blacksmiths, and other similar crafts. Ruglunks that can navigate the egos of others often find slow, but enduring, success in political and social endeavors, as their natural reservedness prepares them to be excellent listeners and problem solvers. They take insults quietly and rarely forget them, but do, with time, forgive. In general, actions speak louder than words with ruglunks."

Born from an almost alchemical fusion of kobolds, horned toads, and poisonous tree frogs, these ruun have some of the most distinct markings and color among their kind. Yellows, greens, blues, and reds peek through their horned exterior, and their sharp claws offer a unique bounty of helpful uses. Because of their toad and kobold ancestry, rangols have little need for moisture, but are still less adapted to the dry and sunny weather than their ruglunk relatives. Rangols are quick-witted and cunning, having needed to survive the constant threats that their home\u2014and fellow kin\u2014pose to them, as life in the servitude of a dragon is rife with danger. When given the opporunity, rangols enjoy sharing trivia and light-hearted jokes, but may have trouble finding the chance to do so among rooble and ruglunk society. Depending on the world you're playing in, their position in Laterreprosp culture may still in flux, as many roobles and ruglunks may struggle to separate them from their ancestral conviction to Acridaethruix. However, the Amphibious Court of Oudaarde supports the rangol refugees and defectors that escape the dragon's influence."
