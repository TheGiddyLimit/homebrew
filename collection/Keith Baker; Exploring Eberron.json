						"Wizards of the Coast announced the Fantasy Setting Search in 2002: a call for a new world for Dungeons & Dragons. They received thousands of entries, including my world--which would ultimately become Eberron. I worked with James Wyatt, Bill Slavicsek, Christopher Perkins, and many more to develop my original idea into Eberron as you know it today.",
						"I'm extremely proud of the world we've created. However, there are elements I love that I've never had the opportunity to explore in an official book. When first designing the world, I included aquatic nations--considering the civilizations that the merfolk, sahuagin, and other intelligent undersea species might build. We developed a unique system of planes for Eberron, something with a very different flavor than the well-established Great Wheel. We presented the idea of a proud empire of goblinoids that ruled Khorvaire long before humanity arrived. But there are only so many pages in any sourcebook, and these ideas had to be trimmed down--or in some cases, cut entirely--in our original {@i Eberron Campaign Setting.} The planes exist, but there was never enough space to describe them in more than a paragraph apiece, which isn't nearly enough to understand what makes Fernia different from the Elemental Plane of Fire, or how you might set an adventure in Mabar. From canon material, we know the sahuagin exist and have ambassadors in Stormreach, but nothing is revealed about their civilizations.",
						"From the very beginning, I hoped that we might see a {@i Planes of Eberron} sourcebook, but it never came to pass--and when Eberron returned in the fourth and fifth editions of D&D, sourcebooks needed to prioritize the key foundations of the setting, and didn't have space to explore these hidden corners. So while I've always had dreams of Droaam and the planes in my head, Eberron is the intellectual property of Wizards of the Coast, and only they could publish new Eberron material. That all changed in 2018, when Wizards of the Coast worked with me to create the {@i Wayfinder's Guide to Eberron}, a PDF supplement released on the Dungeon Masters Guild website... and with that release, they made it possible, for the first time in Eberron's history, for anyone to create new content for Eberron through the Dungeon Masters Guild. The next year, in creating {@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW}--the official fifth-edition hardcover--the design team expanded on the story of the Mror dwarves. But once again, there wasn't enough room to focus on their conflict with the daelkyr and the mystery of the Realm Below.",
						"That's where Wayne Chang, who works with me on the podcast {@i Manifest Zone}, entered the picture. Together, we sketched out a plan for a book that delves into many of the topics I've always wanted to explore--the planes, the Dhakaani, and undersea nations--as well as a few more recent developments, like the Mror. And so, this book was born!",
						"As it turns out, writing a book of this size is a {@i tremendous} amount of work. Laura Hirsbrunner accomplished herculean tasks as both editor and layout designer, while Will Brolley developed immersive monsters, magic items, archetypes, and more. Since working in a vacuum is a good way to die of asphyxiation, I'm incredibly grateful to Laura, Wayne, and Will for being a constant source of feedback and inspiration.",
						"We also worked with a host of artists to develop original art for this book. From Katerina Poliakova's wonderful portrait of Tira Miron, which opens chapter 3, to Marco Bernardini's amazing planar map with its miniature views of every plane, it's been thrilling to see these unexplored aspects of the world come to life. In some instances, to convey a concept to an artist, I put my own limited artistic skills to work. Below is my first draft of a sahuagin city built around one of the slumbering kar'lassa--and in chapter 4, you can see how Vincentius Matthew made sense of my sketch!",
						"I'd be remiss if I didn't also call out the community of Eberron players, DMs, and creators who are all keeping Eberron alive--including our excellent playtesters! And, of course, my brilliant wife, creative partner, and co-founder of Twogether Studios, Jennifer Ellis--who is always willing to have a conversation about undercover shark people or tourist attractions on the Plane of Peace.",
						"Before I lay this book before you, one disclaimer: This is a vision of Eberron as I run it at my table. You'll find a few details that don't align with previous sourcebooks; it's up to you to decide which to use. But remember that there's always a third option: using {@i your} answer. From the beginning, nearly two decades ago now--when we chose not to present the cause of the Mourning or reveal the powers of the Mark of Death--we wanted Eberron to {@i inspire} players and Dungeon Masters, not to limit them. This is a book of ideas for you to build upon--and some, you might even ignore. This presents {@i my} Eberron, but I'm always thrilled to see people making the world their own.",
						"And now--Eberron awaits!",

The purging of lycanthropes early in the ninth century strains relations between humanity and shifters.

In some accounts, Xoriat once encompassed everything; some cults of the Dragon Below assert that the daelkyr are simply trying to restore the original balance of reality. Others contend that there was nothing before creation--that the Progenitors descended from a higher level of reality, the same unknowable realm that lies above and beyond Dolurrh. But almost all cultures agree on the forces that brought reality into existence.",
										"Three beings wove the planes into existence, then used these concepts as the foundation of the Material Plane. The giants assert that these three beings were some form of titan, but the common interpretation is that of the Progenitor Wyrms: three vast, cosmic dragons. Regardless, the tale ends in conflict. After completing the creation of the Material Plane, Khyber struck without warning and tore Siberys apart, leaving his remnants drifting in the golden Ring of Siberys around the world.",
										"Knowing she couldn't defeat Khyber, Eberron coiled around her, becoming the world itself and binding Khyber within a living prison that holds to this day. Thus, the world as we know it is made from the intersection of Siberys, Eberron, and Khyber: the Dragon Above, the Dragon Between, and the Dragon Below.",
										"While this tale is known to all, some traditions give it more weight than others. In the Five Nations, most consider it a simple metaphor for sky, earth, and the monsters that lurk below. Even those who consider it literal truth (as do many druids) don't worship the Progenitors in the same way as they might the Sovereign Host. Siberys is dead, and Eberron is the world itself; she's the source of all life, but doesn't actively intervene in any way. However, a few cults (notably among the kobolds of Khorvaire) do worship the Progenitors directly.",
										"Whether literal truth or metaphor, the battle of these mighty Progenitors took place in the distant past. Its impact upon the present is most importantly this: that there {@i is} a present. As this act of creation brought all things into existence, scholars of Khorvaire have yet to find any relics or records of this time before time. If a story involved an object from a deeper past, it would likely possess vast power and be of tremendous scholarly interest."

Believed by some to be dragons, by others, gods--or perhaps something else entirely--these rebels raised an army of dragons allied with the couatl, native celestials said to embody the last light of Siberys. As the immortal overlords couldn't be destroyed, countless couatl sacrificed themselves, their spirits combining into a prison of pure celestial energy that could bind the overlords.

												"The Age of Demons ended a hundred thousand years ago, long before the foundation of any civilization that exists today. But the time lingers in myth and continues to shape modern life. It's commonly believed that the deities of the Sovereign Host walked the world during this time and physically battled the overlords. However, many scholars assert that these myths are actually based on the deeds of heroic dragons--for example, the myths of the Sovereign Aureon might be inspired by the deeds of a dragon named Ourelonastrix. It's up to the DM to decide the truth, but it could be possible for adventurers to find places or relics tied to the Sovereigns from this age. You might find the lance Dol Arrah used when battling Katashka the Gatekeeper, or the site where she and Dol Dorn flayed the Mockery for his treachery. Whether tied to gods or dragons, these sites and relics still hold power.",
												"While the overlords may have been defeated, they cannot be destroyed. Each overlord is bound in a Khyber dragonshard and held in its prison by the power of the Silver Flame. Though bound, an overlord can influence the world in the region around its prison... and there's no official list of all of the overlords or where they are bound. So if a story calls for a region where the restless dead rise and prey on the living, this could be the prison of Katashka the Gatekeeper. If a region is suddenly overcome by ice and snow, perhaps the shard-prison of Dral Khatuur has been brought there.",
												"Each overlord can only be freed if a particular passage of the Draconic Prophecy comes to pass. The fiends known as the Lords of Dust work to discover and enact these prophecies, while the dragons of the Chamber try to stop them. Both sides frequently use mortals as pawns, so adventurers can easily find themselves caught up in these schemes. As they reach higher levels, adventurers might even become active participants in this struggle instead of mere pawns. Though few mortals are aware of it, this is a constant cold war that determines the fate of the world.",
												"Dungeons from the Age of Demons are rare, few surviving the passage of time. Any remaining sites would be infused with fiendish or celestial power. A vault created by the couatl could hold a deadly artifact tied to an overlord. An obsidian fortress might be imbued with Rak Tulkhesh's power, and people who settle there are consumed by homicidal rage. One of the best documented sites is Ashtakala, an ancient city in the heart of the Demon Wastes said to be the sanctuary of the Lords of Dust."

										"In the wake of the Age of Demons, the dragons were the most powerful force in Eberron. Some dragons helped guide lesser creatures, including the giants of Xen'drik, in their mastery of arcane magic. As the dragons' increasing dominion caused a surge in the Daughter of Khyber's power (see chapter 3), the dragons were forced to withdraw to isolation in Argonnessen. They remain there to this day, in hopes of preventing her power from increasing further.",
										"Multiple nations of giants arose on Xen'drik. The Sulat League specialized in elemental binding and magebreeding. They created the drow as living weapons to deal with rebellious elves, and it's thought that fire giants are remnants of the Sulat. The Group of Eleven was an alliance of eleven city-states, each led by a powerful empyrean mage. Their diverse culture valued internal and external competition, believing it drove evolution. The Cul'sir Dominion was ruled by mighty empyreans and sought to dominate all reality. They explored the planes as well as the world; it's not known whether the Cul'sir attacked Dal Quor or whether the quori of the time sought to invade Eberron, but the two powers fought an extended war. The giants ended the conflict by destroying one of the moons of Eberron with cataclysmic magic, damaging the planar connection between Dal Quor and the world. Since then, the quori have been unable to physically travel to Eberron, and there are no longer any manifest zones to Dal Quor.",
										"These actions had devastating repercussions for giant civilization. In the upheaval, many Cul'sir subjects used the opportunity to rebel, but the largest uprising was that of the elves--both those oppressed by the Cul'sir, and warrior elves who had never been conquered by the giants. When the Cul'sir threatened to draw on their most dangerous magics once more to destroy the elves, the dragons emerged in force from Argonnessen. They utterly devastated the civilizations of Xen'drik, giant and otherwise, then laid curses on the land that are beyond the comprehension of the modern age. To this day, the scourge of the land prevents any advanced civilization from rising again. The Traveler's Curse warps space and makes travel in Xen'drik unreliable. The curse known as the Du'rashka Tul--\"the madness of crowds\"--causes civilizations that become too advanced or widespread to collapse into madness. Draconic curses are believed the reason the giants devolved from mighty titans into hill giants and the other giants known today. The full extent of these draconic curses is unknown, but the impact is unmistakable.",

Elemental airships and the development of the warforged were both inspired by discoveries tied to the ancient giants, and a new find could be just as important. A race to recover a Cul'sir artifact could easily drive an adventure, and Sulat weapons could shift the balance of power in Khorvaire if they fell into the wrong hands.",
												"While Xen'drik's many curses make it nearly impossible to colonize the land, that doesn't stop people from trying! The city of Stormreach is an outpost on the edge of the unknown, a gateway through which powerful artifacts, unknown magics, and exotic creatures flow into Khorvaire.

On Khorvaire, the goblinoids rose to prominence, founding the Empire of Dhakaan approximately 16,000 years ago. Over the course of the next ten thousand years, it expanded to dominate all of central Khorvaire.

One of these eroded the connection to the goblinoids' shared dream that united Dhakaani civilization (see chapter 4). Within generations, the ancient empire collapsed into civil war.

										"The first aberrant dragonmarks appeared soon after the true dragonmarks. At the time the dragonmarked houses joined together as the Twelve, aberrant marks were spread across the Five Nations. Some members of the Twelve truly saw aberrant marks as abominations; others considered them a convenient scapegoat to unite the houses and strengthen their position. House propaganda and whispering campaigns amplified the perception of aberrant marks as dangerous and uncontrollable. Fear progressed to violence, and in time, to squads of Deneith soldiers, Vadalis trackers, and Medani inquisitors \"protecting communities from the aberrant threat.\"",
										"Aberrant dragonmarks of the time were generally more powerful and dangerous than those of today. The Twelve took true stories of innocents harmed by uncontrolled marks and amplified them--superstition and fear did the rest. The title \"War of the Mark\" implies two even sides, but this was more of a purge than a struggle of equals. Toward the end, however, a few aberrant-marked champions rallied others and challenged the houses. The most infamous were Halas Tarkanan and the Lady of the Plague, who seized Sharn and declared it a haven for those with aberrant marks. Eventually, the forces of the Twelve laid siege to the city. When Tarkanan and the Lady saw victory was impossible, they unleashed the full power of their marks. Tarkanan's mark gave him power over the earth, and he shattered the towers. The Lady of the Plague called vermin up from the depths and spread vile diseases in the ruins. Both the aberrants sheltering in the city and the armies attacking it perished, and Sharn remained in ruins for centuries before Galifar I finally reclaimed it.",
										"Aberrant marks were almost completely eradicated during the War of the Mark. When they reappeared in later centuries, they were far weaker than Halas Tarkanan's earth-shaking power, but fear and prejudice linger. Over the last century, with no explanation, aberrant marks have begun manifesting with greater frequency and power. The criminal organization known as House Tarkanan has begun organizing and training those with aberrant marks, fearing another purge could lie ahead.",

But everyone knows that Halas Tarkanan shattered the towers of Sharn, the Lady of the Plague destroyed her village as a child, and the Dreambreaker was a monster who drove people mad as amusement. As a character with an aberrant mark, you bear the burden of centuries of superstition, stories encouraged and exaggerated by the Twelve. And the leaders of House Tarkanan point to the War of the Mark as a possible path the future might take. If you have an aberrant mark, will you join House Tarkanan and prepare to fight the Twelve?

Galifar didn't just want power--he wanted to build a better world, and on many levels, he succeeded. He abolished slavery and instituted laws that promised justice for all. Over time, the kingdom would promote public education and the rise of the merchant class. It can be argued that Galifar stumbled in giving the dragonmarked houses too much economic power; while the Korth Edicts prevent dragonmarked heirs from holding lands or titles, they also lay the foundation for the near-monopolies the houses hold today.",

By this tradition, the children of the reigning monarch served as governors of the five provinces, with the eldest governing Cyre. The previous governors served as regents until an heir came of age, at which point they were expected to step aside.

										"Before the ninth century, lycanthropy was largely just a fearsome legend. Lycanthropes were known in the wilds of Khorvaire, but few people had ever seen one; most commoners thought lycanthropes and shifters were the same thing. Early in the ninth century, something changed--the curse of lycanthropy became more virulent, and its victims were driven to ever more extreme behavior. Werewolf attacks and wererat infestations became an increasing problem in western Aundair, and by 830 YK, some feared that an apocalyptic threat was brewing in the Towering Wood--that any day a horde of lycanthropes could sweep across the land and destroy all civilization.",
										"In 832 YK, Keeper of the Flame Jolan Sol declared that lycanthropy corrupted the soul itself and must be completely eliminated. An army of templars was dispatched to Aundair, and servants of the Flame across Khorvaire were ordered to be vigilant and root out lycanthropes in hiding. And so they did.",
										"The Silver Crusade lasted for nearly fifty years. The first two decades were a brutal, bloody campaign. The lycanthropes were massing in great numbers on the edge of the Towering Wood (now part of the Eldeen Reaches), driven by some unknown evil; most sages believe it was an overlord on the verge of breaking its bonds. The templars were outmatched. The lycanthropes were cunning and could quickly replenish their numbers, and they intentionally stirred up conflict between templars and shifters. But after decades of bitter conflict, the tide slowly turned in favor of the templars. And somehow, the power of the curse was broken. Lycanthropy continued, but its effects weren't as strong, its victims not so driven to darkness.",
										"While the true threat was dealt with, the peasants of Aundair had suffered through decades of terror and sought a greater revenge. The next thirty years saw an ongoing inquisition as zealous converts to the faith--later classified as an extremist sect, the Pure Flame--sought to hunt down every remaining lycanthrope. In the process, many innocents--including a great many shifters--were tortured and slain. So the Silver Crusade began as a selfless act that may well have saved Galifar, but ended up as an outlet for paranoia and hatred.",

It highlights that the goals of the Silver Flame are to protect the innocent, but fear, greed, and anger can lead reasonable people astray. It's the origin of the Pure Flame, an extremist sect whose narrow vision of the Flame is as a ruthless weapon with which to burn evildoers. It has created a deep rift between shifters and followers of the Silver Flame, and hurt the reputation of shifters everywhere.",
												"In the wake of the Silver Crusade, lycanthropy is considered to be a serious public health risk. Templars deal with any confirmed lycanthropes--when possible, they seek to apprehend and cure them, but lethal force is always an option. Lycanthropes can find a safe haven in Droaam (especially with the Dark Pack), and there are still a few scattered 'thropes in Stormreach, Q'barra, Darguun, and other frontier nations.",

In crafting the map of the united kingdom, Galifar declared that Cyre would be the heart of the realm. His daughter would govern the province and have all that she needed to pursue her vision. The crest of Cyre is a crown and bell on a green field above a hammer and bellows--the seat of the crown, the bell that rings in change, and the tools to build the future. Cyre's motto captures the heart of this nation and its people: \"What our dreams imagine, our hands create.\"",
										"The provinces of Galifar largely retained the cultures and traditions of the nations they had once been. In many ways, their differences were reinforced and celebrated. Each nation was given one of the pillars of the united kingdom: the Arcane Congress in Aundair, the King's Citadel in Breland, Rekkenmark Academy in Karrnath, the Grand Temple of Thrane. Cyre was the exception. Rather than building on the existing culture of Metrol, Cyre drew experts and artisans from across Galifar. Instead of being the center of any one discipline, Cyre was the nexus where all of these things came together--the best of what Galifar could be. When the Arcane Congress perfected the {@item everbright lantern|ERLW}, Metrol was the first city whose streets were lit with them. Soldiers trained in Rekkenmark, but the finest warriors served in the Vermishard Guard. While Metrol was the showpiece--a city of wonders--this principle was applied across central Cyre. With education, art, even agriculture, Cyre displayed the best of what Galifar could accomplish.",
										"This continued and evolved over centuries. Karrns are tough, Thranes wise, Brelanders industrious, Aundairians clever. The people of Cyre can trace their roots to all of these nations, believing they share these strengths; and beyond that, Cyrans strive to be creative, innovative, and artistic.",
										"Cyre's artistic (and, some might say, whimsical) temperament was balanced and sustained by the presence of House Cannith, based in the great city of Making. Many of Cannith's greatest forgeholds were spread across Cyre, providing a practical industrial foundation that supported the wonders of Cyre. And those wonders took many forms. Where the Arcane Congress of Aundair focused on the practical applications of magic, the Wynarn Institute of Cyre explored the artistic potential of the arcane. Metrol was a city of light and marvels. Visitors could speak to illusions of past heroes and kings or watch reenactments of historic moments. It's said that no one ever went hungry in Metrol nor felt the bite of winter. Cyrans say that this reflects the generosity and selflessness of the Cyran spirit; critics point out that these social projects were only possible because of the taxes paid by the people of other provinces. Certainly, Cyre held the wealth of Galifar and had a standard of living higher than any other province. Was this decadence? Or was it a work in progress, a model that could have someday been applied to all nations? There's no way to know. Cyrans mourn what was lost; the people of other nations criticize the Cyran lifestyle as parasitic. \"What our dreams imagine, our hands create,\" but bitter outsiders point out that while Cyran hands may have built, they used resources gathered by the hard work of others.",
										"This bitterness was further fueled by Galifar's traditions of succession. Following the example of Galifar I, the monarch's children served as governors of the five provinces. The eldest governed Cyre, and on the death of the monarch, they would take up the crown and their children would take over the governing positions of each province. The prior governors would serve as regents until children were of age, and after that, as advisors. When a monarch lacked five children, the previous governors would maintain the posts. But the principle was simple: Cyre was the heart of Galifar, and all else would shift around it.",

But in the old kingdom of Metrol--which covered an area roughly the size and shape of the modern Mournland--the old systems and rulers were pushed aside to make room for Cyre's dream. Some of the noble families of Metrol embraced this new path. Others were resettled by Galifar, granted authority over regions that had previously existed as independent frontiers.",

The region had first been settled by immigrants from the Khunan region of western Sarlona. Galifar I wanted the lands of old Metrol, so he instead gave its nobles authority over Eastern Cyre, setting them as the feudal overlords of the Khunan settlers. The Blade Desert served as a physical and cultural divide, and after granting the nobles their lands, Galifar largely ignored them. The noble families thus held to the old traditions of Metrol rather than embracing the new culture of Cyre. Many were petty and proud, dissatisfied with the arrangement, and cruelly took it out on their Khunan subjects. Some wonder why it was so simple for the elves to seize control of Valenar; first and foremost, it's because the Khunan people had no love for their Cyran rulers (generally called \"thrones\"), and many feel they are actually better off under the new regime."

										"Following the death of Jarot, the kingdom of Galifar spiraled toward war. Initially, Cyran morale was high. Queen Mishann had centuries of tradition behind her. Everyone knew that Cyre had the best of everything: the finest wizards, the best soldiers, the foremost artificers. And on one level, this was true, but a single unit of exceptional soldiers means little when set against the martial cultures of Karrnath or Thrane. Cyre's finest wizards were artists and theoretical scholars, whereas Aundair had long worked on magic as a tool of war. And the expert artificers were largely tied to House Cannith, which remained neutral in the war. If you consider the nations as characters, Thrane is a paladin, Karrnath is a fighter, Aundair is a wizard, and Breland is a rogue. In this party, Cyre is the bard--elegant, clever, and doing a little bit of everything... but best when working with others, not prepared to stand alone against a powerful foe.",
										"Cyre adapted; it had to. Initially, it relied heavily on mercenaries, as it was the seat of Galifar's treasury and had the gold to spare. But as time passed and the scope of the conflict became clear, Cyrans devoted themselves to war. Cyre lacked the martial spirit of Karrnath or Thrane, but its people were sustained by the absolute belief that they were in the right. Beyond that, in the eyes of the people, Cyre was Galifar. It embodied the ideals of the kingdom, the best of what it could be--and that was something worth fighting for. Nonetheless, the struggle dealt a tremendous blow to the Cyran psyche. For centuries, Cyrans had seen themselves as the stars of the show, beloved by all; now all hands were raised against them, and some, at least, could see their former beliefs as arrogance and narcissism. Cyre had indeed had the best of everything, but because it was freely given. Now the Arcane Congress devoted its knowledge purely to the good of Aundair, Rekkenmark trained only Karrns, and the King's Citadel served Breland. Yes, Cyre had echoes of all these things. Its wizards were still a match for any nation other than Aundair, and the Vermishard Guard formed the core of Cyre's new military academy.

This reflects the founding principles of Cyre--to gather the best aspects of Galifar and to build upon them. Cyrans believe there's no single perfect path; diversity is a source of strength, but there's always room for improvement. Cyran culture is thus a strange chimera--a blend of familiar elements from across Khorvaire combined with a steady, ongoing evolution. A Cyran musician might play Karrnathi funeral dirges in the style of a Thrane devotional; it's a puzzle where the pieces are known, but they're constantly being arranged in new ways. Some citizens of the other nations believe this is appropriation--that the Cyrans are carrion crawlers who steal from others while arrogantly believing they can do better.

In addition to clothing like gloves, boots, and cloaks, jewelry and other accessories are important parts of Cyran fashion.

The typical soldier in the armies of the Five Nations would use the {@creature guard} or {@creature bandit} stat block, both of which have 11 hit points.

The high hit points of exceptional individuals--such as player characters--reflect their role as heroes, people who somehow avoid a deadly strike or who can grit their teeth and persevere through damage that would send a lesser person into shock. When designing weapons and battle magic, the mages of Arcanix and artificers of the Twelve were using the typical soldier as the baseline, not a player character.",

This is designed for an elite squad fighting against exceptional foes: it deals high damage with a significant area of effect. But imagine you're fighting 120 guards with longbows, who start shooting at you once you enter their long range of 600 feet. You may never get close enough to cast your {@spell fireball}. Even if you do, the damage output is far greater than you need (an average of 28 damage against enemies with 11 hit points). {@spell Fireball} is an excellent tool for a small squad engaging powerful foes, which describes the typical party of adventurers. But on a battlefield of common soldiers, it proves inefficient, as range and radius are more important than high damage output. The {@object siege staff|ExploringEberron} may not inflict as much damage as a {@item staff of fire}, but it hits more enemies and from farther away.",
														"This impacts how scenes unfold when your player character is on the battlefield. In the interests of story, the DM doesn't want your party to be wiped out by the first blast of a {@object siege staff|ExploringEberron}; how is that a compelling adventure? Instead, that blast might deal only 12 points of fire damage. It drops half of the soldiers accompanying you (who failed their saving throws), but you and your companions take shelter from the worst of the blast and keep pressing forward. {@damage 3d6} damage may feel low because it won't kill a player character. But it can kill commoners and typical soldiers; the fact that adventurers can keep going under fire shows how remarkable they are."

Regardless, they believe in the importance of change, taking on many personas during their wanderings. Tinker, bard, courier, and priest are common roles, and the changeling might well be quite talented at their trade. Traveler priests can preach a sermon to the Host in the morning and lead Flamesong in the evening. As they conceal their true changeling nature, Children are usually invisible to the people around them; they use a secret language of tattoos and scars to identify one another, along with a set of shared personas.",

Others assume that because changelings have the uncanny ability to change their faces at will, that they will use it for malevolent ends, cheating honest folk before moving on. Changeling traditions predate Galifar and its laws, and indeed, some deem it fair to \"obtain\" another's possessions as long as they're replaced with a gift of equal value. And a few travelers assert the Traveler's blessing is their license to prey on the \"single-skins\"--a term for races lacking the changeling gift for shapeshifting. However, travelers are no more innately dishonest than any other people--whether dragonmarked heir or Gatekeeper druid--though those that respect local customs are still subject to much suspicion due to their shapeshifting abilities and nomadic preferences.",

The Gray Tide principality of the Lhazaar Principalities is a nation of changelings with a strong mercantile tradition; some say that the Gray Tide engages in a great deal of piracy, using their shapeshifting gifts to shift the blame to other princes. In Droaam, changelings are said to have a stronghold in the city of Lost.

When you adopt the trappings of a faith, you feel a connection to it. You've had visions tied to every faith, and the magic flows through you.

When you expect to be going into battle, shift your trappings to Dol Dorn. Fighting lycanthropes? Turn to the Silver Flame. About to speak to the dead? Time to call on the Blood of Vol. In taking on all these faiths, you are deeply empathetic, you accept all beliefs as valid, and you seek to help people of different faiths understand one another. Another possibility, if your DM likes the idea, is that you can receive divine visions based on the faith you're currently embodying. Adopting Onatar's trappings won't give you the mechanical benefits of the Forge domain, but you may receive a vision from the Sovereign. Again, this is purely a story idea--and it's always possible that your divine visions are just deep-rooted delusions!"

But the dead guide and protect the living. When remarkable elves die, they are preserved beyond death. Most are tied to {@i spirit idols}, statuettes that preserve the soul and prevent its dissolution in Dolurrh. But others are raised as deathless, undead similar to mummies but sustained by positive energy. Deathless soldiers guard the catacombs and temples, and deathless sages and councilors share their knowledge and wisdom with their descendants. Over time, the deathless can rise to an even greater state, becoming beings of pure spirit with little need for a body. These sprits, known as ascendant councilors, reside in the great city of Shae Mordai, and it is when their spirits join together in a mystical gestalt that they wield divine power.",

But the Undying Court refers to {@i all} the undead guardians of the island, from the soldiers to the {@i spirit idols}. You may not expect to become an ascendant councilor--this is a process of evolution that typically takes thousands of years--but you can aspire to join the Undying Court after death.",
												"As an Aereni, you have a keen awareness of the duty you owe to the Undying Court. The deathless are sustained by positive energy; this can be drawn from Irian manifest zones--such as the one in Shae Mordai--but it is also generated by love and devotion. Unlike many religions in Eberron, the Undying Court doesn't rely on faith; there's no question whether the Court exists. But it does depend on devotion. Your prayers and your faith are the offering you give in exchange for all that the Court has done for you and your people--from protecting your land from invasion, plague, and natural disasters to guiding your leaders and training your young. Your ancestors protect you, but they also need your devotion to survive."

While dormant, the spirit within the idol is unaware of the outside world or the passage of time, existing in an ongoing trance--a dreamlike existence built from memories and personal experiences. A {@i spirit idol} can be awakened with the {@spell speak with dead} spell, though some remain conscious indefinitely and can be found serving as tutors, provosts, and judges.",

An Aereni artisan can spend multiple human lifespans perfecting their craft. Even while trancing, an elf may be contemplating their work. However, Aerenal lags behind Khorvaire in industry and innovation. The Aereni aren't trying to find better ways to do things; an elf artisan's goal is to match the skills of past masters rather than find new techniques. Challenging the past would be an insult to those ancient masters--and in Aerenal, they're still around and still teaching their techniques. An Aereni artificer can produce a very rare magic item no Cannith forge can match, but it's a handcrafted work of art that takes years to produce, while the Cannith forge is churning out a host of common and uncommon items, and constantly searching for ways to innovate. The Five Nations may not match Aerenal today, but over the last thousand years it has evolved dramatically, while Aerenal stands still.

Wererats and werewolves are cruel killers... but Grandmother Wolf doesn't encourage savagery, and Grandfather Rat doesn't urge murder.

										"The Silver Crusade began when a dark power surged in the Towering Wood, amplifying the power of lycanthropy. The curse became more virulent. Victims fell prey to its power more quickly, guided by some dark power beyond the common evil of the curse. Within the Towering Woods, tribes of shifters fought their corrupted kin. Beyond it, the farmers of Aundair were tormented by raiding wolves and boars.

Meanwhile, among the shifter tribes, scouts warned of atrocities committed by the foreign soldiers. In fact, the demagogues on both sides were wererats working to ensure that these possible allies would instead become bitter enemies... and the trick worked. Frightened templars and paranoid mobs slew many innocent shifters, and to this day the extremist sect known as the Pure Flame claims all shifters are servants of darkness.",

The unknown force responsible was likely also behind the surge that caused the Silver Crusade--and it could rise again. One logical contender is the daelkyr known as Dyrrn the Corruptor. It's said that Dyrrn created doppelgangers by twisting changelings; it could have used this same technique to create lycanthropes from shifters. Or it could have been the work of an overlord, an archfiend of the Age of Demons; some texts speak of the Wild Heart, an overlord who destroys civilizations and feeds on primal cruelty. Ultimately, it's up to the DM to decide if the answer will be revealed, and if so, what it is.

Or maybe the shared faith of the tens of thousands of people who believe in the Sovereigns has created wells of power in the collective unconscious, and the paladin draws on this powerful force instead. In a practical sense, the truth is irrelevant; regardless of its nature and source, the power exists. And this is where science fails. The Silver Flame is a source of divine power, a force that has held demons at bay for millennia. Those who seek to defend the innocent and fight supernatural evil can draw on its power.

Practically speaking, this means the spellcaster has to be able to speak and use their hands, and that these are somehow tied to casting a spell. But where a wizard may recite a complex incantation, the verbal component of divine magic could be the simplest of prayers: \"Dol Arrah smite my foe!\" or \"Stand revealed in the light of the Flame!\" Or it might be more complex, perhaps singing a hymn or reciting a passage from an ancient text. In both cases, the verbal components are statements of conviction and intent. Just as arcane magic is more than words and gestures, divine magic likewise has a mental component.

Is it a warning that he's an agent of Rak Tulkhesh? There is no clear answer; it's up to you to interpret it. The divine power is telling you something, but can your mortal mind make sense of it? As with unreliable magic, visions should be rare and remarkable. Such a vision is a reminder that you are in touch with a higher power, but you should never take this gift for granted or come to expect it."

												"Divine magic and arcane magic are the two most common forms of spellcasting, but they're far from the only paths. Primal magic draws on the ambient power of the natural world, and is commonly used by druids and rangers. The verbal components of a primal spell might include a bird call or invocation of an animal spirit; somatic components might mimic the motion of a beast or spreading roots. Psionic magic uses the focused power of the mind, and chapter 2 includes suggestions for adding psionic flavor to kalashtar characters. A warlock might say that they are directly channeling their patron, acting simply as a vessel for that power."

										"Faith is a part of everyday life in the Five Nations. The people of Galifar were devoted to the Sovereign Host, and this echoes through its institutions--marriages are sanctified by Boldrei and judges swear oaths to Aureon. The Sovereign Aureon is the patron of wizards and magewrights, and Cannith artificers look to Onatar and the Traveler for inspiration. Many dragonmarked heirs assert that their marks are divine gifts.",
										"So faith remains widespread, and there is no inherent clash between arcane and divine magic, but most commercial magical services are provided by arcane magewrights, not divine adepts. Priests can often cast {@spell thaumaturgy} or {@spell ceremony|xge}, but rarely wield other forms of magic. The job of the priest is to provide spiritual guidance to their community; if you're looking to fix your injured leg, you go to a Jorasco healing house, not to a temple.",
										"As a result, people are well aware of divine magic, but it's not taken for granted in the same way arcane magic is. The people of Eberron understand that divine magic isn't necessarily reliable, as discussed in the \"Gifts in Time of Need\" sidebar. A paladin player character will never lose their class abilities, but an NPC templar might gain divine power only when fighting supernatural evil and be unable to produce those effects at other times.",
										"People with the abilities of clerics and paladins are usually found serving as champions of their faiths. They are exorcists, templar commanders, inquisitors, and missionaries venturing into dangerous lands. You wouldn't just go into a temple of Boldrei and demand to be healed. Clerics and paladins are remarkable, and people will assume that you were given your powers for a special purpose.

While some say this proves the existence of divine intervention, others assert it's simply that deep devotion allows anyone to channel divine power under the right circumstances. In some cases, divine power can be temporarily granted by an immortal entity, as the paladin Tira Miron was strengthened in her battle against Bel Shalor by a couatl guardian.",
												"Player characters rarely have power stripped away; their core abilities should be reliable unless the player and DM agree to add uncertainty to their abilities. But NPCs could receive temporary divine gifts; the old smith described above could be a vital ally in a battle, but at the end of the adventure, his powers leave him. In the case of a player character, any character with faith could temporarily receive a boon (as presented in the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}) tied to a particular quest or purpose. That purpose might be made clear--gifted by a spiritual guide like Tira's couatl, or revealed in a divine vision--or it could be a mystery. Such a gift is temporary, and will be lost when it has served its purpose. This sort of gift should be especially rare and remarkable; Tira and the couatl is a legendary event, not something taken for granted. But it is something that can happen if it fits an adventure."

In a Seeker community in Karrnath, you may find skeletons animated by the local priest tilling a field. A devout blacksmith might cast {@spell magecraft|ExploringEberron} by calling on Onatar instead of learning it from Cannith--but unlike with arcane magic, this devout blacksmith can't teach the spell to an apprentice. Divine spellcasting is a gift, not a job; an apprentice might earn that gift with their own devotion, but it's never a sure thing.",

										"Divine magic is real. For a player character, it's reliable, and under fifth edition rules, clerics and paladins don't risk losing their powers if their actions aren't perfectly aligned with their faith. As discussed in the \"What is Divine Magic\" section above, there are many ways to reflect the importance of faith and what makes playing a divine spellcaster feel distinctly different than playing a wizard.",
										"But what happens when that faith falters? A DM and player could work together to reflect the evolution or even loss of faith by an equally dramatic mechanical change to a character. Consider a paladin who discovers or does something that deeply undermines their faith. If the character simply loses their class features, no one will have fun. But you could redesign the character as a fighter of the same level, reflecting the idea that their divine abilities are gone, but they're still a tough, hardbitten warrior. Or in reverse, you could start a campaign playing a fighter as a former paladin who lost your way; if you find redemption or new faith over the course of the campaign, you could eventually redesign the character to be a full paladin.",
										"Similarly, a character's beliefs might evolve rather than be lost entirely. Tira Miron began as a paladin of Dol Arrah but later embraced the Silver Flame. It's equally possible for a cleric of the Sovereign Host to have a journey that leads them to embrace the Blood of Vol; this sort of character evolution can be a remarkable story, and be reflected mechanically by the DM and player working together to swap their class archetype.",
										"These mechanical changes might require some suspension of disbelief, as the paladin who becomes a fighter might suddenly be a significantly better fighter, and the cleric who swaps domains might lose proficiencies and have to throw away their armor. This is an imperfect process, and it's up to both player and DM to find ways to push past this and explain them within the story: {@i \"My armor was a prison. Now that I've embraced the light, I can't bear to carry the weight of war on my shoulders.\"} It's important to maintain game balance, even if it means overlooking a few blips in the story. But changing beliefs can be a good reason for a dramatic mechanical shift within a character. Ultimately, your beliefs--or lack thereof--don't have to be limited by a class choice you made at 1st level. Whether it's ultimately strengthened or abandoned, questioning and exploring faith can be an interesting path for any character."

The Church of the Silver Flame is a practical, pragmatic faith founded on active public service.

The church doesn't inherently challenge the worship of the Sovereigns, and the two faiths have coexisted peacefully throughout history.

Brelish and Cyran templars would quickly unite with Thranes if a supernatural threat arose in the midst of a conflict; if demons from Shavarath appeared on a battlefield, all templars would unite against them.

If it's possible to eradicate a threat without violence--such as curing a lycanthrope rather than killing it--that's acceptable, even laudable.

Thus, it wasn't her own words that established most of the church's traditions and doctrines, but the words of those who fought alongside her during that year.

While it's a focal point where the Silver Flame's power bleeds into the world and a conduit for those who seek the guidance of the Voice of the Flame, the Silver Flame itself is far more than a spark in one cathedral--its power stretches across Eberron, binding overlords on every continent. The Church of the Silver Flame celebrates the Keeper of the Flame as being both the vessel of the Voice and the channel for the power of the Flame.

In the church's eyes, these northern orcs are a curiosity and their unusual beliefs don't threaten the faithful of the Five Nations. Likewise, the Council of Cardinals has taken no action to suppress the extreme beliefs of the Pure Flame, even going so far as appointing the puritan Archbishop Dariznu as governor of Thaliost. In part, this is because the Pure Flame came into its own over the course of the Last War, and the cardinals of Thrane had little ability to enforce their will over the faithful of Aundair. Dariznu's appointment was an effort to ensure that the followers of the Pure Flame would accept the authority of Flamekeep. Despite the church thus far taking no action against the Pure Flame, Keeper Daran is deeply troubled by this sect and is considering the best way to address the problem.",

In 497 YK, a peasant woman calling herself Melysse Miron challenged Keeper Kyra Danth for control of Flamekeep and the Church of the Silver Flame. Melysse claimed that Tira Miron had revealed she was Tira's direct descendant and the rightful Keeper. She challenged many church doctrines and claimed it had strayed from its path. And like Keeper Danth, Melysse was shockingly able to wield the power of the fountain of fire in Flamekeep, performing miracles no lesser priest could match. This triggered a deep schism that lasted for years, until Melysse was finally revealed to be the chosen hand of the Shadow in the Flame--it was not the Silver Flame, but rather the overlord Bel Shalor, that strengthened her in Flamekeep. Because of the fear that her death would allow Bel Shalor to choose a new AntiKeeper, Melysse wasn't killed; instead, she was petrified and placed in Dreadhold, where she remains to this day.",
										"More recently, the church was divided in 914 YK when Keeper Serrain was invested with temporal authority over the nation of Thrane. While many celebrated the idea of a kingdom founded on the noble principles of the church, there are many--even some in Thrane itself--who believe that investing cardinals and Keeper with political power distracts the church from its proper mission and serves as an invitation to corruption. This served as justification for the foreign templars who fought against Thrane in the Last War; they argued that they continued to respect the spiritual authority of the Keeper, but that the church shouldn't rule a reunited Galifar. The priests of Stormreach went so far as to condemn the theocracy and Keeper Serrain. In the wake of this division, Stormreach was formally severed from Flamekeep; it receives no support and Flamekeep doesn't acknowledge its priests within the church hierarchy. As such, Stormreach has become a haven for those who believe in the principles of the Flame but question its doctrine.",

You could be a ranger who trusts in the Flame to sharpen your aim even though you have no formal role within the faith. Most of the commoners of Thrane fall into this category: people devoted to the faith, but not part of its structure. What role does the Silver Flame play in daily life?",
												"A few basic tenets guide the faithful masses. As a farmer, you may not have the strength to fight alien evils, but you can always guard against the evil within and help those around you to choose light instead of darkness. Church doctrine urges the faithful to act with empathy and compassion, seek to understand the troubles of those around you and to lighten their burdens, resist responding to anger with anger, and turn to violence only as a last resort. Not everyone can live up to these ideals, and the Last War was an inherently violent time. But the faith still urges everyone to resist the evil within, and instead to embrace the virtues of generosity and compassion.",
												"As discussed earlier, the church also emphasizes unity against supernatural threats. The world is a dangerous place, and those who have strength should always use it to defend the innocent. Every village in Thrane maintains a militia prepared to defend the community from the unnatural. Archery is a common devotional practice among the faithful; some say the rainbow-feathered arrows represent the couatl defending the innocent, but they also reflect the practicality of remaining as far away from danger as possible.",
												"The Church of Thrane believes in the value of hierarchy, but the church can't grant the divine powers of a cleric or paladin--these come through faith and noble intent. As such, you can play a character who draws power from the Flame without having any formal tie to the church itself. The primary question is why--if you are a paladin, why have you made the decision not to become a templar? Do you feel the hierarchy is corrupt? Or do you simply feel you're called to follow a different path?"

												"Backgrounds are an easy way to create a character with an established place in the hierarchy of the Church of the Silver Flame. Ministers and friars would typically take the acolyte background, while the Military Rank feature of the soldier background can reflect your rank as a templar. Are you still an active agent of the church, or have you been released from your duties after serving with distinction? {@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW} presents the templars as an option for the religious order group patron, exploring the idea that your entire group of adventurers could be fighting evil on behalf of the church. However, you could also serve alone. Friars of the Silver Flame are charged to wander the world and combat evil through acts of compassion and charity; if you're a friar with the powers of a paladin or a cleric, that would certainly encompass protecting innocents from supernatural evil wherever you encounter it. You could be a retired templar who continues to fight evil as an adventurer, or you could be a templar given a specific mission that coincides with the goals of the adventurers. Or you could be tied to the Argentum, an order which began with the mission of finding and destroying dangerous magic items, but that has since come to serve as the espionage arm of the church.",
												"In making a character with ties to the hierarchy, consider which branch of the church you call home and how this affects your outlook. If you were trained in Flamekeep, you're most likely a strong supporter of the cardinals and the theocracy. On the other hand, if you're from Breland, you might be more pragmatic, if not entirely corrupt. As a cleric who served in Sharn, you could potentially take the criminal background instead of acolyte; you no longer have significant influence in the church, but you still have friends in low places."

However, many also distrust the cardinals of Thrane, and should the Keeper make a proclamation that goes against their beliefs, they're quick to attribute it to the corrupt cardinals putting words in her mouth. A movement in Thaliost urges Archbishop Dariznu to rally forces and seize Flamekeep in order to \"liberate the Keeper,\" though the Pure Flame doesn't have the forces, resources, or training to pull off something like this.",
												"Members of the Pure Flame are intolerant, bigoted, and violent, rejecting the compassionate principles of the faith and denying that all are equal in the light of the Flame. However, because of their fanatical devotion to the fight against evil, they might offer adventurers assistance against a real supernatural threat. Purists are generally NPCs, not player characters, as their uncompromising and intolerant nature will likely cause clashes with other adventurers. That being said, a player character might be a former Purist seeking redemption for their vile behavior, or perhaps a young Aundarian rebelling against a Purist upbringing and broadening their horizons."

Rather than venerating the Flame itself, serpent cults honor the countless couatl whose sacrifice brought it into being. A common myth says that the couatl were formed by the last breath of Siberys, unleashed to contain Khyber's evil. These cults maintain that the Silver Flame was formed when the couatl sacrificed their individual existence and bound their celestial energy together to bind the overlords; research suggests that this is true, though it's not in the common doctrine of the church. Rather than revering a Voice or Keeper of the Flame, the serpent cults listen for the guidance of couatl themselves. A few couatl did remain separate from the Flame in order to serve as guardians or carry out specific missions, and it's also possible for couatl to temporarily serve as spiritual guides; this was the case with Tira Miron, and could also be the case with an aasimar tied to the Silver Flame.",

If you're tied to a serpent cult, work with your DM to determine its size, origin, and influence.

												"Human settlers to Khorvaire brought the faith of the Sovereign Host with them, but the Blood of Vol is indigenous to the continent. The line of Vol was a noble line of Aerenal, as described in chapter 2, with a long tradition of necromancy tracing its roots back to Xen'drik. When members of the line of Vol developed the dragonmark known as the Mark of Death, they undertook a risky series of experiments designed to unlock its full powers. This ended when the Undying Court and the dragons of Argonnessen joined forces to eradicate the bloodlines that carried the Mark of Death. In the aftermath of this brutal purge, those elves who had supported Vol but didn't bear its blood were given the choice of exile or swearing fealty to the Sibling Kings of Aerenal. This resulted in a wave of exiled elves settling in the Lhazaar Principalities and spreading west into the lands that are now Karrnath.",
												"These exiles brought the knowledge of necromancy along with stories of how the heroic family of Vol had sought to attain godhood, only to be destroyed by the jealous gods. The people of the region knew nothing of Aereni traditions or dragonmarks, and they blended this story with their own experience of life in a harsh land, local tyrants, and the empty promises of Sovereign priests. And in the process, they somehow discovered something real. The line of Vol had never sought the divinity within, but these first priests found it, drawing divine power from their own conviction and their own souls.",
												"So despite its name, the religion was never practiced by the line of Vol, nor by the infamous Erandis Vol herself, who was in hiding during the period in which the faith evolved. It is a faith born of the blending of elf and human myths and traditions. While the faithful believe that \"Vol\" was the first person to find the divinity within and challenge the curse of mortality, the faith is based around the divinity within each of us, not the worship of this mythical Vol. Even devoted priests of Vol do not know Erandis Vol's identity, though they respect the name of \"Vol\" as author of their core texts, believing that this Vol challenged the Sovereigns, then was subsequently destroyed by these jealous gods--a martyr of the faith. Modern Seeker scholars debate the origins of the name, whether Vol was an individual or a group of people, or related to the elven line at all. So if Erandis Vol were to proclaim her true identity, many of the faithful would be impressed by her lineage, but her bloodline alone wouldn't give her divine authority."

The tyrannical leaders asserted that the Sovereigns blessed their bloodlines and their rule. By challenging the benevolence of the Sovereigns, these early Seekers were also challenging the despots of the time. As time marched on and those petty tyrants fell, the Sovereign Host remained the dominant faith of humanity in Khorvaire, and the philosophical divide between Seeker and Vassal only grew.",
												"The Seekers were also shunned for their use of necromancy, generally considered taboo and said to be condemned by Aureon and Dol Arrah. This prejudice grew worse with the rise of Galifar and the Church of the Silver Flame, which asserted that undead are inherently anathema and drain the life from the world by their very existence. In turn, this caused people to blame plagues and blights on the Seekers. However, the Blood of Vol is a faith grounded in the principle of an oppressive universe, and it endured in spite of this prejudice and persecution. But it never spread far beyond the harsh lands where it began, and Seekers are often still met with fear and suspicion today."

As a paladin, you are calling on the power of your own blood when you heal your allies or smite your enemies. The visible manifestations of magic of the Blood of Vol typically involve crimson energy, as if luminous tendrils of blood are flowing from you. But it's not simply your power. Consider the Seeker priest who casts {@spell commune}; how can they gain information they don't already know? The answer is that the divinity within is something far greater than you. It is a god, possessing celestial power you can't understand or imagine--but it is still in its chrysalis, waiting to be born. When you cast your spell, you awaken a sliver of its power; once the spell is done, it returns to its rest.",

Scholars of other faiths argue that the Seekers are deluded, that their powers are simply drawn from some other source, the same kind of delusion that allows a warforged cleric to draw magic from their devotion to the Lord of Blades.

												"The Blood of Vol emerged from collaboration with Aereni necromancers, and the undead have always been associated with the faith. First and foremost, this link is born out of practicality. Seekers have no reverence for corpses; the divinity within is tied to life and to the soul, and once those things are gone, what's left is just meat and bone. As an extension of this, most Seekers want their corpses to be put to use. The faith is driven by the idea of serving a community--why let your corpse go to waste when it can help your friends and family? As such, mindless undead are commonly seen in Seeker communities serving as guardians, performing manual labor, and completing other simple tasks.",
												"However, a common misconception is that Seekers want to become undead. Some do, driven purely by the fear of oblivion, but undeath is a miserable half-life, not a triumph. The divinity within is bound to your blood and your soul, so Seekers believe that the souls of undead are trapped in their corpses, the spark of divinity lost to them. Those who embrace undeath are seen as martyrs, and generally expected to protect and serve their Seeker community. One of the most public of these champions is the mummy lord Malevanor, the high priest of Atur. The former high priest of Atur was the mummy Askalor, who held the post for over four hundred years--but he was weary of his long undead existence. When Malevanor was grievously injured during the Last War, Askalor transferred his power and his undead existence to his apprentice. This raises an interesting question: if the divinity within lies in the blood, how does Malevanor cast divine magic? The answer is that Seeker communities ritually draw their blood and share it with these champions. Vampires drink this blood, while mummies or liches may bathe in it. Through this, undead priests draw their power from the blood of the living faithful.",
												"Another factor in the long association between the Blood of Vol and necromancy is that Seeker communities have often formed in or near manifest zones to Mabar. While such areas are often inhospitable or dangerous, over the course of many centuries, Seekers have learned how to tap the energies of these places. Because Mabaran manifest zones are usually blighted, outsiders often accuse the Seekers of causing blights. In reality, the Seekers often perform rituals that limit the negative effects of the manifest zones--so instead of causing the plagues and blights associated with Mabar, they often prevent them."

												"If the power of the Blood of Vol flows from within, who answers when a cleric conjures a celestial or invokes {@spell planar ally}? One simple answer is for the DM to use a being who has the statistics of a celestial or fiend, but that is formed from blood and magic; it's a manifestation of your own divine essence and fades away when its work is done. This might seem a strange match for {@spell planar ally}, a spell that normally requires payment to an external force, but even an ally of your own essence might demand a service in return. This could be seen as a request from your subconscious--a demand that you do something you know you should do, but that you've been trying to ignore. On the other hand, it could be a mysterious task with no discernible purpose; this ties to the fact that your Divinity Within is something beyond mere mortal understanding, and you don't fully understand what it needs or wants.",
												"Another possibility is that you're drawing on the Seeker community rather than reaching to the planes for assistance. One principle of the faith is that champions become undead so that they can help other Seekers. When you cast {@spell planar ally}, rather than calling a celestial or fiend, you might summon an undead champion of your faith; this could be anything from a vampire to a mummy lord or a death knight. In this case, the payment they demand for their service would likely be a tithe to the Seeker temple they are bound to.

Toward the end of the war, Regent Moranna turned on the faith and the Blood of Vol became a scapegoat for all of Karrnath's troubles. Moranna claimed that the famines and plagues the people had suffered were caused by the Seekers. Its nobles were stripped of their lands. Chivalric orders of Seekers were disbanded. Some--notably the infamous Order of the Emerald Claw--refused to surrender, but most Seekers remained loyal to their nation even when it betrayed them.",

Kaius III has sealed most of his undead forces in the crypts below Korth and Atur, but he isn't willing to entirely surrender this strategic advantage. Fort Bones and Fort Zombie remain bastions of loyal Seekers. But the faith is no longer celebrated, and the old warlord lines still mutter that they would have won the war if only they'd relied on skill and steel instead of foul magics. In playing a Karrnathi Seeker, do you support the crown and believe that Kaius III is only doing what he has to do to maintain the support of the warlords, or do you despise Kaius III and Moranna for betraying your faith?"

Variations of the Sovereign Host can be found across Eberron in many different cultures--the Pyrinean Creed of humanity, the Rushemé faith of the giants of Xen'drik, the Cazhaak traditions of Droaam. Precise names and groupings change, but the faith's basic principles remain the same.",

You don't expect to meet Dol Dorn because you know he is with you every time a blade is drawn, ready to guide your hand. Aureon watches over the wizard studying magic and the judge presiding in court. The Devourer is present in every storm, and you can't fight him any more than you can defeat an earthquake with a sword. A true Vassal doesn't need proof of the Sovereigns' existence for the world itself is the proof.",
												"With that said, many myths depict the Sovereigns in the flesh, performing heroic acts and setting particular elements of creation in motion. These myths are set during the Age of Demons, and Vassal doctrine maintains that the Sovereigns defeated and bound the fiendish overlords. As the overlords previously ruled reality, once they were defeated, the Sovereigns ascended to fill that role. So there are stories of Dol Dorn performing tremendous feats of strength, and you might find an artifact said to be Onatar's hammer; but these date back to a mythic age when they were champions, not yet true Sovereigns.",
												"Every culture depicts the Sovereigns in different ways. The giants depict them as giants while the Pyrinean Creed (discussed in a later section) depicts them as humans. Many cultures use draconic imagery to represent the Sovereigns. But since the Sovereigns don't manifest physically, any representation of them is purely symbolic. Dol Dorn is the Warrior, Onatar is the Smith--any image that clearly depicts these concepts will do."

A large community generally has an eight-sided temple to the Sovereign Host, staffed by full-time priests. In smaller villages and towns, there might be an untended shrine or a local person who is considered to be especially close to a Sovereign and performs ceremonies. In the town of Riverford, the innkeeper Dara is said to speak with Boldrei's voice; she's the pillar of the community, and people come to her with their problems and disputes.",
												"A Sovereign priest's role isn't simply as an intermediary to the divine; anyone can talk to the Sovereigns. Instead, priests offer guidance and clarity, helping you understand the path you're on. A temple or priest often serves another function beyond their religious duties; the Great Hall of Aureon in Sharn is a library as well as a temple, while you might find a shrine to Kol Korran at the center of the public market. Priests serve as teachers, mediators, and guides, but they are often also subject matter experts in the path tied to the Sovereign they serve.",

You should follow the laws (Aureon) and value the traditions of your community (Boldrei). Industry (Onatar) and commerce (Kol Korran) are encouraged, though greed (the Keeper) is not. On the battlefield, you should fight with courage (Dol Dorn) and honor (Dol Arrah), while not engaging in needless cruelty (the Mockery). You should trust in Aureon's laws and not take vengeance into your own hands (the Fury).",

Many people aren't devoted Vassals and don't actually believe the Sovereigns are guiding their every action. But even such pragmatists recall the names of each Sovereign, know many of their songs, and will celebrate Wildnight or Boldrei's Feast. By and large, if you live in the Five Nations, it's assumed you're a Vassal unless you specifically say you're not."

Hunters in Aundair give thanks to Balinor, but orcs in the Shadow Marches invoke Baalkan the Beastlord, while the Talenta halflings tell stories of clever Bally-Nur.",
												"Some of this is a natural process of syncretism. The Marcher orcs blended their original beliefs with the traditions of human settlers. But the Talenta were telling their stories before they ever encountered humanity. Though scholars debate the reason why, most agree that the more similar a tradition is to an archetypal Sovereign, the easier it is to draw divine power from that faith. A culture that invokes a deity of the hunt is more likely to produce clerics and paladins than a culture that worships a giant salmon of the same name--and if the deity's name is similar to \"Balinor,\" the connection to divine magic will be easier still. Vassals sages assert that this proves the existence of the Sovereigns, while skeptics say it could simply be a numbers game--it's easier to draw power from a shared belief, and belief in the Sovereigns has reached critical mass.",
												"Because of this diversity, Vassal priests are rarely concerned with heresy. Those who follow the Pyrinean Creed may attempt to correct what they see as flawed beliefs, but ultimately, most just smile at the ignorance of the Marcher orc, content in the knowledge that {@i they} know the proper names of the Sovereigns. Likewise, while player characters and NPCs may choose to follow one of the paths described below, you can always develop a unique twist on tradition or introduce a new cult that worships a specific grouping of Sovereigns. This openness is also reflected in Vassal interactions with the Church of the Silver Flame. The Pyrinean Creed asserts that the Sovereigns defeated the overlords at the dawn of time; if the Silver Flame is what keeps the overlords bound, presumably the Sovereigns created it. So there's no inherent conflict; rather, a Vassal will simply shrug and say, \"But why do you worship a cage?\""

In creating a Sovereign cleric, you can assert that you have a close tie to a particular Sovereign and primarily speak on their behalf; in this case, use the domain associated with that Sovereign. For example, the {@class cleric||Life|life} domain is a good option for a cleric who speaks for all Sovereigns equally, as it provides a general ability to protect your allies and community; and the {@class cleric||Knowledge|knowledge} domain makes sense for a priest who's more scholar than warrior."

They hold the unorthodox belief that mortals can ascend to become Sovereigns themselves--that by emulating a particular Sovereign, a mortal can eventually take their place. Popular rumor holds that the founder of the Library of Korranberg, Dorius Alyre ir'Korran, built the library as part of a quest to assume the mantle of Aureon. While this Sovereign ascension is believed to occur after death, some priests teach that devoted members--especially those who donate great sums to the temple hoard--can actually become dragons in life.

One of a priest's most important duties is helping bereaved choose appropriate grave goods or sacrifices sufficient to distract the Keeper and ensure the deceased's soul reaches Dolurrh.

The Restful Watch believes that if Aureon knows that a dead hero will be needed in the future, he has the Keeper snatch the soul before it reaches Dolurrh, so it can be restored when the time is right. Thus, while the Restful Watch primarily reveres Aureon, they also understand and respect the Keeper, and believe that he serves a vital purpose.",

You may have been sent out in the world to watch for signs that this conflict is coming to pass; this could require you to investigate the Mournland or clash with the Lords of Dust.",

This could be one of your fellow adventurers--and as an acolyte or sage of the Restful Watch, you've been assigned to follow this person around, chronicling their life and making sure to perform the appropriate rituals when they die. \"Don't mind me, I'm just going to follow you around until your heroic death.

The Shadow whispers that there is no common good--all that matters is what you need and what you can do. Why should you make sacrifices for others instead of doing what's best for yourself? Why should you give when you can take?",

But how far will you go in pursuit of your ambition? What--or who--will you sacrifice? Priests who embrace this aspect of the Shadow call themselves Mentors, emphasizing that they can show you how to achieve your full potential; others call them Tempters, as they will always drive you down the darkest path.

The Shadow can also serve as a warlock's patron, likely in the role of the {@class warlock||Fiend|fiend} or the {@class warlock||Hexblade|hexblade|XGE}. While the Shadow won't interact directly with a warlock, they could receive visions like a priest; they could interact with a fiend who claims to speak for the Shadow; or they could be mistaken about the nature of their patron, and actually be bound to the overlord Sul Khatesh.",

Priests of the Shadow can sometimes be found working as fixers in the criminal underworld; how much are you willing to pay for the knowledge you seek?",

Both those who fear the Traveler and those who revere it agree on one thing: whatever gifts the Traveler gives, they always lead to chaos. If the Traveler gives you knowledge, it's because the revelation will force you to reevaluate everything you have known. If it helps you deceive, it's because your actions will introduce chaos and crisis--whether into your life or the lives of others. Onatar will teach a swordsmith to make a better sword; the Traveler might show them how to make a bomb, changing the face of warfare. The Traveler isn't here to satisfy your greed or to grant your ambitions. Instead, it will set you on paths you never thought to try. This may sometimes grant you good fortune, but when you call on the Traveler, you're inviting the unexpected into your life.",

Those who invoke the Traveler know that its gifts will surely have a cost and could shake the foundations of civilization, but they still yearn for that grand discovery. Many in House Cannith believe that Aaren d'Cannith--the inventor of the warforged--was a Traveler cultist; others assume that the Mourning may have been the work of a Cannith heir following the path of the Traveler.",

Guides seek to challenge established traditions, laws, or institutions--not necessarily to destroy them, but to ensure that they haven't outlived their usefulness. Still others are wanderers, embracing a life of constant change. The changeling travelers described in chapter 2 fall into this category, believing that as long as they remain in motion, the Traveler will guide and protect them. Ultimately, the Traveler will throw your life into chaos--for it's by adapting to this chaos that people grow."

								"The title \"Cult of the Dragon Below\" is a blanket term used to describe any sect that serves a malevolent power or has bizarre beliefs that defy rational thought. But no member of such an organization would call themselves a \"cultist of the Dragon Below.\" As a true believer, you might be a blessed eye of the All-Seer, a pilgrim on the road to the Inner Sun, or a warlock in the court of the Queen of Shadows. If you're a member of one of these three cults, you don't see the other two as allies, for they're clearly dangerous and delusional. And while outsiders may be able to guess what force is behind the cult--it doesn't take a Korranberg sage to guess that the people growing eyes on their hands might be tied to Belashyrra--only a fraction of the cults of the Dragon Below knowingly serve a daelkyr or overlord.",

The structure defines the shape and scale of a cult, while the power is the malevolent force behind it, usually a daelkyr or fiendish overlord.

And he produces revenants, innocents who wake up convinced they are reincarnated soldiers with a duty to complete unfinished battles. This is common--most overlords and daelkyr have multiple cults, each completely unaware of another. While each cult is unique, most fall into one of the following three categories.",
										{

											"name": "Corrupted",
											"entries": [
												"Members of these cults are united by shared delusions, the reality of their minds corrupted by a horrifying alien force. Sometimes the delusion infects those who take part in the rituals; other times the ideas first leak into people's minds, then draw them to the cult. This is why the cults of the Dragon Below can never be wiped out, and why they can appear anywhere--you never know when or where an irrational idea can take root, twisting the thoughts and beliefs of innocent people.",
												"While a corrupted cult's beliefs and actions may seem irrational to outsiders, to members of the cult they make perfect sense. A revenant truly believes they are a legendary hero reincarnated. A Vigilant Eye cultist believes they've been given blessed vision that reveals evildoers who must die. The fact the cultist has grown a new eye doesn't seem strange to them--{@i it's a blessed eye! Others are just jealous they don't have one.} Corrupted cultists may see the world differently than people around them. A group of revenants could be working with a mind flayer and dolgrims, but they see these aberrations as loyal knights tied to their ancient order. When encountering a corrupted cult, player characters will face the challenge of making sense of the delusion--understanding what the cult members believe they're trying to accomplish, and how it relates to what they're actually doing. These delusions have nothing to do with mental illness and cannot be treated at a Jorasco healing house. This is a form of supernatural influence with a specific cause--a corrupting alien entity--and with a specific effect; corruption can take hold of anyone at any time, and cultists may otherwise appear perfectly healthy and sane.",
												"Corrupted cults rarely last long. They typically come into existence with a clear purpose, a specific scheme that somehow benefits their guiding power. After this scheme succeeds or fails, the driving force often abandons the survivors. The question is whether this releases cultists from the delusion, or whether they are simply abandoned--or even driven toward destructive acts. A second important question is whether it's possible to free a cultist from their delusion while the cult is still active. This could require magic, such as {@spell greater restoration}. But it could simply require the cultist to be isolated from their allies and deprogrammed, or perhaps separated from an item that is reinforcing the delusion. If this powerful delusion can be broken, perhaps the cultist's original identity can reassert itself.",
												"The power behind a corrupted cult isn't always obvious. Loyalists know the power they serve and often proudly proclaim it, but many other corrupted cults aren't aware of the power behind them. Vigilant Eye cultists could mistakenly believe that their blessed eyes are a gift from Aureon, while a revenant might believe Dol Arrah has returned them to the world. Even if the cultists themselves don't realize who they serve, the trappings can be a giveaway. Belashyrra's cultists often deal with eyes or beholders, Dyrrn employs illithids and doppelgangers, and Kyrzin's cults usually have something to do with oozes and slime. But sometimes a cult can appear perfectly innocent. Are you absolutely certain that revenant {@i wasn't} restored by Dol Arrah?"

Their strongholds are in desolate regions--the Demon Wastes, the Shadow Marches--but immigrants have carried these beliefs into the Five Nations. The members of these cults have been raised to believe that the traditions of their faith are normal. {@i You remember when your grandmother was consumed by the gibbering mouther in the basement. What's wrong with that? It was her time and her passage to immortality; you've heard her speaking to you in the whispers of the mouther. You hope that you'll live long enough to join her in its bowels.}",
												"Traditional cultists are typically less volatile and extreme than corrupted cultists; surviving long enough to become a tradition means avoiding reckless behavior and learning to keep your faith hidden from strangers. Many traditional cults can seem harmless; for the most part, Whisperers have no interest in harming or interacting with outsiders. However, traditional cults provide a lurking support network that can be activated when needed. {@creature Rak Tulkhesh|ERLW} has loyalists hidden throughout the armies of the Five Nations, always ready to escalate violent situations. And a town could be filled with followers of the Transcendent Flesh who appear completely harmless and mundane--until the Night of Six Moons, when they all attach their symbionts and tear apart any outsiders unlucky enough to be in the town that night.",
												"Traditional cults are less extreme than corrupted ones, but they still see the world through a strange lens, despite knowing the power they're bound to. Some traditional cults believe their patrons are simply misunderstood--{@i Dyrrn seeks to elevate humanity, not to corrupt it!} Others celebrate the destructive or chaotic aspects of their patrons, either believing that this corrupt world deserves to be torn down, or that the faithful will be elevated in the next age. Even a cultist who reveres {@creature Rak Tulkhesh|ERLW} may not be evil; they could believe the corrupt world must be washed in blood to cleanse evil, and aside from their duties to the Orphan King, they may be gentle and altruistic."

Daelkyr can provide symbionts and physical transformation, while the Lords of Dust can provide wealth, influence, or ancient artifacts to their loyal agents. As a result, transactional cults often begin as secret societies. People join of their own free will, eager to obtain whatever it is the cult has to offer. But even if someone joins for the most rational of reasons, the influence of a daelkyr or an overlord is difficult to resist; the longer someone remains in the cult, the more power it will have over them.",
												"Consider the Court of Shadows cult, tied to {@creature Sul Khatesh|ERLW}. A wizard has a fascinating conversation with a colleague, discussing a spell unlike anything they've seen before. The colleague explains that the spell is from Ashtakala's vaults, and if the wizard joins the Court, they'll discover many amazing things about magic and history. So they go to a meeting and are impressed by the scholars and warlocks they meet. Soon they're initiated into the cult, swearing an oath to the Queen of Shadows and being invested as the Knight of the Forgotten Library. It seems like a game, and they're gaining access to fascinating new spells. But as time passes, they become ever more obsessed with rising in the Court of Shadows. The political interplay in the Kingdom of Shadows feels more real, more relevant than the mundane politics of Khorvaire. They pursue missions for the Queen, yearning to win her favor. And they hope that someday the Queen will rise from her slumber, for then, the Kingdom of Shadows will truly become real.",
												"Transactional cults can be found anywhere on this slippery slope. A transactional cult might use symbiont weapons but otherwise be quite rational. Or, while you can still see how they stumbled into this mess, they could be completely pulled into the warped reality espoused by the cult.",
												"Transactional cults are typically small, but can be widespread. A coven of the Court of Shadows may only have a few members, but the Court itself is spread across Khorvaire. Often, members of transactional cults know who they are dealing with, but greed or curiosity overrides concerns. However, it's also possible for people to only know part of the story; a warlock might believe that the Queen of Shadows is a mighty warlock or perhaps an archfey, not realizing she's actually an overlord."

All of the malevolent powers described in this section have loyalists, cults that are devoted to releasing their lords from Khyber or helping their agents (be they Lords of Dust, mind flayers, or rogue dragons) with whatever they require. But beyond the loyalists, cult goals can be a little more exotic.",
										"Corrupted cults usually have some sort of immediate goal that drives the formation and expansion of the cult. {@i The Vigilant Eye is hunting down \"demons\" hidden in the community, which can only be seen with their blessed eyes! The revenants have to re-enact a brutal massacre that occurred five hundred years ago today!} The goals are often terrible things that must be stopped, but it's not always obvious how they are helping the power behind the cult; these schemes may have nothing to do with the seals of the daelkyr or releasing an overlord. In the case of an overlord, the archfiends gain strength by driving mortals down their paths. For {@creature Sul Khatesh|ERLW}, getting mortals to use magic for malevolence strengthens her regardless of what they actually do; likewise, {@creature Rak Tulkhesh|ERLW} revels in all violence. Meanwhile, the daelkyr are truly incomprehensible. They certainly enjoy experimenting with their preferred mediums; one of {@creature dyrrn|ERLW|Dyrrn's} cults could enact a ritual that causes dragonmarks to come to life and attack their bearers, with no purpose beyond satisfying Dyrrn's curiosity. As the daelkyr experience time in a nonlinear fashion, it's also possible that what seems like meaningless chaos could have a unforeseen future--that there will come a time when a living dragonmark unleashed in the cult's bizarre rampage ends up being the vital element needed to defeat one of the Lords of Dust. The key point is that cults of the Dragon Below--particularly corrupted cults--may not have long-term plans; their schemes can and should often appear nonsensical.",
										"Traditional cults are religions. They aren't driven by short term goals, but instead provide guidelines on how to live your whole life. Traditional cults can be peaceful and innocuous... until they aren't. A particular alignment of moons, a vision sent to the cult leader, a critical mass of outsiders arriving at the same time--any cult could have a set of circumstances that trigger bloody rituals or brutal sacrifices. This is where the absurdity of a traditional cult rises to the surface. The people of Lowholt couldn't be kinder--until the flesh barn runs low on spleen and they have to harvest your organs. {@i It's a real shame, stranger, but our grandparents have to have that spleen}--the \"grandparents\" in this case being the gibbering mouther in the basement.",
										"Transactional cults are often initially driven by the desires of the members. Someone joins a transactional cult because they want the power to do something--to take revenge on their enemies, to overthrow a tyrant, to destroy a local criminal gang. But the patron always has a price, and this can eventually follow the same model described for corrupted cults earlier."

If the cult has inhuman allies, are they fiends, aberrations, or other monsters? What sort of treasures and magic items does the group use? These magic items aren't necessarily direct gifts from the patron; a cult of Kyrzin may have many potions because the high priest is an alchemist, or because a strange fountain in the temple secretes mystical fluids. In the case of loyalists and traditional cults, the connection to its patron may be quite obvious, whereas corrupted cults can be challenging to identify the hidden manipulator. Regardless of whether cultists know the identity of their patron, the power behind a cult has many effects.",
										"As a broad rule, cults tied to overlords (Rak Tulkhesh, Sul Khatesh, Katashka, Bel Shalor, the Daughter of Khyber) are either directly helping the Lords of Dust or trying to drive behavior that strengthens the archfiend. The daelkyr (Belashyrra, Dyrrn, Kyrzin, Orlaask, Valaara) are more enigmatic. Their traditional cults may continue strange patterns of behavior handed down for generations, performing sacrifices or mysterious rituals when the planes are aligned. But they can also engage in dramatic actions with no clear benefit to anyone. There's no clear reason for Orlassk to turn citizens of Sharn into gargoyles; it could be an experiment, or simply a form of art.

Its most widespread cult calls itself the Hive; members of this sect surrender their individuality to serve the collective, with mammals acting as if they're insects.

								"There are sources of divine magic that are concrete and clear--the Silver Flame is a pool of energy that binds the overlords, and spellcasters can divert its power for other purposes. There are other sources that are less certain--are the Sovereigns the deities their followers believe them to be, or is the power of a Sovereign cleric simply drawn from the power of collective belief? And then there's a third kind of source, where divine spellcasters draw power from devotion to forces that clearly are not divine and have no obvious way to grant such power. How is it that a warforged paladin can draw power from their devotion to the Lord of Blades when the Lord of Blades doesn't wield such power himself? Is a cleric of the Dragon Below actually receiving their power from a daelkyr, and if so, how?",

										"The most common theory advanced by theologists in Eberron is that people with exotic or implausible beliefs who wield divine magic are actually drawing that power from another source without realizing it--that their faith is so strong that an actual existing power answers the prayer. Phthaso Mogan of Sharn has written a treatise in which he describes a man who performed miracles based on his fanatical devotion to his own shoe. Mogan concluded that the man was actually receiving his power from Kol Korran, the Sovereign of Travel. But while it's possible to draw spells from worshiping a shoe, this would be extremely rare. Though the cause is debated, scholars recognize that the more similar your target of worship is to an archetypal Sovereign, the more likely you are to be granted divine magic. And thus, over the ages, civilizations have gravitated toward worshiping a variation of the Sovereign Host.",
										"Mogan also proposed that clerics of unusual faiths may actually receive their spells from the Traveler, who might support such ideas to cause chaos and undermine faith in established traditions. Korranberg scholar Dravo Den Talas has proposed an alternate theory: that if there is any truth to the beliefs of the Blood of Vol, {@i all} divine magic could be drawn from the mystic spark of the caster. According to Talas, the actual belief is irrelevant; it is purely the strength of faith that matters.",
										"Regardless of what they conclude, the various theories generally acknowledge that a paladin who worships the Lord of Blades doesn't actually have to draw their power from the Lord of Blades himself. The power might come from within the paladin, it could be ultimately drawn from Dol Dorn or Onatar--or even be a gift of the Traveler."

A kalashtar cleric could present their {@spell command} as psychic ability, while a paladin from a cult of the Dragon Below could describe Divine Smite or Lay on Hands as being empowered by a disturbing symbiont that encases the arms of the paladin. Warlocks and barbarians might seem more thematically appropriate for many of the cults of the Dragon Below, but the same concept can be applied to clerics or paladins; while they are driven by their faith, their powers are based on gifts, physical mutations, or otherworldly revelation, as opposed to coming as a literal answer to prayer."

This bold claim considerably extended the territory held by the preceding nation of Wroat--but it was nothing more than a claim. The Brelish people had no need of the lands to the west, nor did they want them. The Barrens--their name for everything west of the Graywall Mountains--were known to hold foul swamps and barren plains, an untamed region filled with all manner of deadly monsters. Explorers to Breland's newly acquired territory soon confirmed these tales. The plains were filled with goblins and hungry gnolls. The mountains were home to harpies whose songs could lead the unwary into deep chasms, where trolls slept on piles of bones. The Barrens had nothing the Brelish believed worth fighting for, and so it was left alone. Occasionally, questing knights or bold templars would cross the Graywall to battle giants and slay ogres, but the region was largely ignored.",

Castle Arakhain became a favored royal residence in the eighth century, bringing new prosperity to Ardev and Shavalant. However, the ensuing wave of western settlers was met by fierce raiders crossing the gap between the Graywall Mountains and Silver Lake. Bloodied settlers brought back tales of bellowing minotaurs, orcs, ogres, and goblins lurking in every shadow. An attack at Castle Arakhain led to the brief Westward War, the might of Galifar driving the raiders back across the Graywall and obliterating many of the marauding bands. The fortress Orcbone was established as the gate between the people of Breland and the monsters of the Barrens, and the king founded the Westwind Riders to patrol the border. The Riders held the line throughout the ninth century, and Brelish settlers even staked claims along the Graywall. This period peaked with the founding of the fortress-town of Stubborn in the foothills (now known as Stonejaw). Then the Last War changed everything.",

Some believe it was the original homeland of the goblinoids, a theory supported by a significant number of Dhakaani ruins along and below the mountain ranges, as well as below the Great Crag itself. In the Graywall Mountains, a set of thousand-foot statues commemorate the six kings who came together to form the ancient Empire of Dhakaan. But while this region may have once been important to the dar, it was utterly devastated in their war against the daelkyr, compounded by the return of forces long held at bay by the empire. Vicious gnolls swarmed south from the Towering Wood. Fierce orcs emerged from the western swamp. Trolls and ogres came down from the mountains. Those dar that remained were infected with daelkyr curses; instead of standing together against the invaders, they turned on each other, and centuries of chaos and bloodshed followed. By the time it was done, all that remained of Dhakaan was ruins. Hobgoblins and bugbears had been eradicated in the region, and goblins were scattered and divided.",
												"The region was dominated by anarchy from then on--some believe this merely follows the natural instincts of the region's inhabitants, while others point to the lingering influence of the daelkyr. There were a few bastions of civilization--the Venomous Demesne, the hidden village of Lost--but the people of these communities had no interest in expanding their culture; they were either fortified, hidden from the outside world, or both. Across the rest of the Barrens, history was marked by the rise and fall of countless mighty chibs. Chib is a Goblin term sometimes translated as \"chieftain,\" but it literally means \"boss\" or \"big person\"--and in the Barrens, the chib was often just the biggest creature around. Typically a band would form around an ogre, ettin, or troll--a creature powerful enough to assert their will over goblins, kobolds, or lesser creatures of their own kind. But while powerful, these creatures lacked the ambition or drive to build anything that could last. Occasionally a more intelligent leader--a minotaur warlord, a charismatic oni--would build a greater force, perhaps even establish a dynasty that would last a generation or two before being overwhelmed by the relentless, brutal tide."

Not all of the Westwind Riders were Brelish, and with Wroaan's coronation, soldiers returned to serve their home nations, and Wroaan needed all the troops she could muster.

With forces tied up to the east, it was up to the commanders of Orcbone and Stubborn to protect the west.

However, it was utterly unprepared for the force that struck it in the last decade of the war. A typical band of raiders might include a single troll or a handful of ogres, but in 986 YK, the soldiers of Stubborn found themselves facing phalanxes of armored trolls fighting with deadly skill, and squads of ogres acting with discipline and coordination. Stubborn's defenders leapt off the walls in pursuit of harpies' songs, and the walls were shattered by hurled stones.

												"To the people to the east of the Graywall Mountains, it seemed that the Daughters of Sora Kell appeared out of nowhere--and it felt much the same to the chibs of the Barrens. But evidence suggests that it was the culmination of years, or even decades, of planning. How long did it take to train the trolls and ogres now known as Maenya's Fist? How did the Daughters acquire the armor and weapons wielded by this force? Some say that Sora Maenya assembled her troops in a forgotten Dhakaani fortress deep below the Byeshk Mountains, and that she oversaw the forging of their weapons in this ancient foundry. Sora Maenya calls the soldiers of Maenya's Fist her children, and some scholars believe this might be literally true; both her war trolls and skullcrusher ogres are smarter and more capable than their common cousins. But how long would such an endeavor take? Melian Mit Davandi of the Library of Korranberg has advanced the theory that demiplanes may have been involved--that Maenya's lair in Khyber could exist outside of the normal flow of time, allowing the schemes of the Daughters to be both a recent development and the work of generations. Sora Teraza approached the Queen of Stone and the lords of the Venomous Demesne in 985 YK, and the Daughters brokered the services of fully half of the Znir Pact mercenaries in this time. No one knows just how long the Daughters spent in preparation--but 986 YK is when they made their presence known.",
												"Leading up to the attack on Stubborn, the Daughters spoke with--and dominated--the greatest powers of the Barrens. The chibs of the plains only understood force, and the Daughters displayed it; the scattered bands of raiders were forced to submit, and those who refused to bow to the Daughters of Sora Kell were executed in gruesome ways.",
												"In 987 YK the Daughters of Sora Kell summoned the region's most powerful leaders to the ruins now known as the Great Crag. There, Sora Katra presented the blueprint for the new nation, appointing warlords and specifying their responsibilities and regions. Work began on the greatest cities of this new nation: Graywall, the Great Crag, and the port city of Vralkek. The old fortress of Stubborn was repurposed and renamed Stonejaw. While some of the raider bands were left to follow their old ways, many were absorbed into the new nation. Thousands of goblins and kobolds were freed from their oppressive chibs and given opportunities in the new cities. This new order was maintained by gnoll peacekeepers of the Znir Pact. When that proved insufficient--when a chib refused to release their captive subjects or defied the Daughters--Maenya's Fist would descend to destroy them. The message was simple: Change was coming. You could find your place in Droaam, or you could choose obliteration.",
												"The Daughters' ambitious plans were strengthened by an alliance with House Tharashk. For Tharashk, this provided access to the rich mineral resources of Droaam and the services of monstrous mercenaries, which opened an entirely new path for the house. For the Daughters, it tied them to a force with a legitimate voice and influence in the East. Tharashk agents convinced the Twelve to open up trade to Droaam--at least to the new city of Graywall. The house helped to organize laborers and build the new cities. Through Tharashk, the denizens of Droaam began to appear throughout the Five Nations, though tensions continued in the vicinity of Orcbone. Gargoyles and harpy couriers found a niche in Sharn. Ogre laborers could be found in Fairhaven and Wroat. In Sharn, the Gargoyle replaced the Bat in the Race of Eight Winds. Today, many citizens of the Five Nations are still uncomfortable around these creatures, but their presence is slowly becoming less remarkable."

In exchange for loyalty and service, they receive sustenance, shelter, and pride--driven in part by the knowledge that they are defying the arrogant nations of the east.

The people of Droaam know that the Daughters of Sora Kell are legends, that they possess untold powers, and that Sora Teraza knows what the future holds. Most truly believe that Droaam has a grand destiny, that they'll defy the expectations of the world, and that together, they'll build something glorious.",

												"Droaam has several exotic languages, from the chattering of the Znir Pact gnolls to the medusas that communicate with each other through the hissing and weaving of their snakes. However, this region was once dominated by the Empire of Dhakaan and Goblin has long been the common language of trade. Almost every Droaamite speaks, or at least understands, Goblin.",
												"When using stat blocks for a Droaamish creature, you should generally substitute Goblin in place of Giant or Orc. The ogres and trolls of Droaam have no ties to Xen'drik, where the Giant language was spoken. The Orc language was largely eliminated from common use thousands of years ago, and it's nearly extinct in Khorvaire today, though there could be a community of Gaa'ran orcs that still speak it.",
												"Common is used as a trade language, and in modern times, many creatures speak it in addition to Goblin. Even before the arrival of the Daughters, the people of the eastern Barrens often knew a little Common from interacting with Brelish settlers and the Westwind Riders. Today, the Daughters are encouraging the spread of Common, and have even begun providing regular classes in the language in Graywall and the Great Crag, as understanding Common is useful for commerce and for creatures who could serve as Tharashk mercenaries. Ultimately, it's up to the DM to decide if a particular creature should speak Common--and if so, just how much it speaks. It's possible that an NPC may only know a few specific phrases in Common, or that a player character will have to make a Charisma ({@skill Performance}) check to convey their meaning to a creature that understands little of the language.",
												"Literacy is common in the more civilized regions of Droaam. Medusas, tieflings, and changelings are generally literate, as is anyone who works as a merchant or envoy. But at the moment, much of the general populace is illiterate, in contrast to the Five Nations, where education has long been considered a basic right.",
												"While Droaamites speak Goblin, they aren't dar like the Dhakaani discussed later in this chapter; they have no interest in {@i muut} or {@i atcha}, and don't use many other words integral to Dhakaani culture. Notably, they don't use the terms {@i chaat'oor} or {@i gath'dar} to refer to humans and their kin. Instead, they use {@i aravaat}--easterner--to refer to people of the Five Nations, and more generally, to refer to humans, halflings, dwarves, elves, and similar species. Most Droaamites don't bother to learn the names of the different nations of Khorvaire. The West is the Shadow Marches, home to Tharashk and the former home of Sora Katra. The North is the Towering Wood, former home of Sora Maenya. Everything else is the East, and that's all most people really care to know about it."

												"The nation of Droaam, which has only existed for eleven years, has a general structure established, but it's constantly evolving. The Daughters may implement new ideas or institute new offices tomorrow, and a rebellious warlord could be crushed and replaced on a moment's notice. As it stands, Droaam has been split into {@i lheshat}--a Goblin term meaning \"domain of a warlord.\" Each lheshat is governed by a warlord who answers directly to the Daughters; each is charged with maintaining a military force that can serve the Daughters.",
												"For now, each warlord has the power to rule their domain and organize their own army as they see fit. There is no standardized system for either bureaucrats or soldiers; in the former Barrens, the most powerful local official is still called the chib, though they may no longer be the largest or most physically menacing creature in the community. In the cities where multiple species live side by side, the common populace is divided between soldiers, skilled laborers, and the general labor force; these are organized by and under the direct authority of the local chib. Such cities have a grist mill (discussed later in this section) and a series of barracks, providing food and shared shelter for all workers. You won't own property unless you have valuable skills or an impressive position, but you can find free food and shelter in any city--though as the cities are still expanding to meet capacity, in many places, that shelter is a bedroll in a tent. Katra's vision is that all creatures of Droaam would work together, part of the greater whole. Ideally, a laborer who works hard should have no fear of abuse--foremen shouldn't beat (or eat) their crews on a whim, an improvement over life in the Barrens. Katra wants the workers to be respected for their efforts, much as the golin'dar are treated with respect among the Kech Dhakaan. But while the Daughters promote this ideal, it doesn't always work out in practice; there are still lheshat that treat laborers cruelly. Even where workers are treated well, it's balanced by the understanding that anyone who challenges the Daughters or the warlord will be crushed without mercy.",
												"In any given lheshat, the warlord governs their domain and the chibs beneath them lead each community. But there are three forces that operate outside this system, working directly for the Daughters and wielding authority throughout the land:",

Many focus on their role as entertainers, sharing stories with the common folk and painting tales of the bright future that lies ahead. Others are focused more on mediation and the administration of justice, especially if there is unrest between the chib and laborers.",
														"A few elite soldiers of {@b Maenya's Fist} usually accompany an emissary of Katra's Voice; if the Voice can't soothe troubles, the Fist will end them. These armored trolls and ogres are deadly and utterly devoted to the Daughters; a single war troll can crush a band of insubordinate minotaurs.",

												"Droaam isn't bound by the Code of Galifar, and there is no uniform code of justice. Justice is thus entirely in the hands of the local chib, unless Katra's Voice overrides them. Every chib maintains their own force of guards. In a small village, this might be a handful of Gaa'aram orcs, but in a large city like Graywall, the guards are a versatile and significant force: orcs, minotaurs, and ogres with support from harpies and gargoyles. Any major community also has a garrison of Znir gnolls. These mercenaries serve as peacekeepers when needed, but they serve the Daughters directly, not the chib; in part, they are present to deter a chib from turning against the Daughters.",
												"Ultimately, Droaam is a wild frontier. For the most part, the law is simple: don't mess with the chib or anything that belongs to the Daughters. The guards don't care about random street brawls or bar fights. They don't care if someone stole your purse. They aren't interested in what laws a fugitive may have broken in some other land. However, they do care about significant damage to buildings, or about any situation that could result in the death of multiple laborers--anything that threatens the overall productivity of the community. So player characters can get away with a great deal in Droaam, as long as they are careful. The local guards won't interfere when a Sentinel Marshal arrests a war criminal hiding out in Graywall--but they also won't interfere when three trolls the criminal hired attack the marshal in return. First and foremost, the guards protect the town and the chib; personal rights and property mean little in Droaam for lesser citizens. If you want justice, you usually have to enact it yourself.",
												"In most communities, a chib punishes serious crimes with immediate execution. For lesser crimes, a victim is branded and either severely beaten, maimed, or given trial by combat; most large cities have an arena that serves this purpose (though people can also be gladiators by choice). Those that survive their punishment are freed.",
												"There is one recourse for those who seek justice: Katra's Voice includes magistrates who have the power to administer justice. Magistrates travel between smaller communities, while larger ones, like Graywall, have a resident magistrate. The current fashion is that magistrates are medusas. If a magistrate believes a case has merit, she orders the chib to deal with it--but if she considers the complaint to be frivolous, she petrifies the plaintiff. As a result, very few people take the risk of seeking justice--but it's a comfort to the laborers to know that they could.",
												"Graywall has a sizable foreign quarter, the Calabas. Xor'chylic, the illithid warlord of Graywall, has granted Kundran Torrn of House Tharashk the right to prosecute crimes committed in the Calabas; this means that in that quarter, much of the Code of Galifar holds sway. This system could be applied to other communities that have a sizable eastern population.",
												"A few basic principles to keep in mind when considering law and order in Droaam: while the local guards generally don't interfere in casual street fights, deadly violence isn't as common as outsiders think. There's an unspoken rule that larger creatures have the right of way; the goblins know to vacate the path of a troll. There are, of course, exceptions; {@i everyone} clears a path for a medusa. Beyond this, most of the Droaamites living in the large cities want to be part of Katra's plan. The troll knows that the little goblins, annoying though they might be, are supposed to be her little brothers. She'll give a little brother a smack if he pushes her--he needs to know better--but she won't go out of her way to kill him, and she won't eat him. If you antagonize a troll, it may slash you with a claw; but if you immediately show contrition, the conflict ends there. Conversely, if a group of easterners start picking fights, the Droaamites feel no such obligation to these outsiders; even if the guards don't interfere, other citizens might, and a wise human keeps a low profile in a city of monsters."

There's little difference between justice and revenge, and if you want either, you'll likely have to seize it. The world is split into predators and prey--and it's always better to be the predator. Surviving to the end of a day is a victory, and having shelter and food should be celebrated, not taken for granted. The people of Droaam are steadfast allies to those they count as friends, and fight to protect the things they love. But they care nothing about the fate of strangers: if protecting a friend means causing suffering to a stranger, so be it.",
												"Bear this in mind when creating characters from Droaam. If you are cruel to strangers, it's because you believe the world to be a cruel place. You may pursue noble goals and be the most reliable friend anyone could wish for, but you were born in a harsh world, and it's the only life you've known.",
												"This cruel world is changing. The Daughters dangle the dream of a better world; Katra urges Droaamites to think of all of their comrades as family. Serve the Daughters and you'll have food and shelter. But that's all balanced by the fact that if you challenge them, they will crush you without mercy. And to most Droaamites, that's a perfectly reasonable arrangement."

												"Droaam has no established currency; the standard reward for daily labor is sustenance and shelter. Most Droaamites rely on barter for goods, skilled labor, or luxuries. However, most merchants in major cities accept the coins of the East, as well as two secondary \"currencies.\" Miners often trade using slivers, small chunks of precious metal or gemstone shards. It's also common to barter and gamble with bounty-marked teeth. The Daughters of Sora Kell (through the chibs) offer a bounty on certain dangerous animals, paid by the tooth. A Goblin symbol identifying the animal it's from is carved on each tooth, but most merchants won't accept teeth unless they personally recognize the tooth--so you can't just carve \"wyvern\" on wolf teeth. While the DM could treat bounty-marked teeth as another form of coinage--\"the old goblin offers three displacer beast teeth, worth 10 silver\"--adventurers who kill a dangerous monstrosity might wonder what the bounty is for their teeth. The DM could roll on the Individual Treasure tables in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide to determine the bounty offered for a creature of any CR. However, the tooth currency is based on the value the Daughters have placed on each bounty, and not every creature has a golden mouth. Some dangerous creatures might have a high value while others are worthless. The bounty is a way to encourage the elimination of threats, and if a creature doesn't threaten the people of Droaam--or is perhaps even an ally--there won't be a bounty on its teeth.",
												"While bartering can be more time-consuming than dealing in coins, it's also an opportunity to introduce interesting adventure hooks. Perhaps a goblin merchant can't make change for a platinum piece, but she offers a scrap of vellum in exchange; it looks like a piece of a map, and she says it came from below the city. Dhakaani relics, odd remnants of the daelkyr war, an object pawned by a Brelish deserter--any of these could be worth little to the one offering it, but priceless to those who receive it.",
												"Droaam's main exports--brokered through House Tharashk--are byeshk and other ores from the mountains, Eberron shards from the plains, and the mercenary services of its people. But it's also the source of unsavory goods that are often illegal in the Five Nations. Poison is a simple example, but there are other more exotic substances. Dragon's blood is described in chapter 4 of {@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW}. Courage is a stimulant that grants a user advantage against saving throws to avoid being frightened; however, long-term use causes paranoia and can leave someone in a state of catatonic terror. Blood gin is a necrotic narcotic, distilled from berries from a Mabaran manifest zone that are fermented in the blood of someone who died by violence; it induces euphoria while replaying the final moments of the victim's life, but frequent users can suffer dreadful nightmares. These are just a few examples, and Droaam is home to many unnatural goods that can't be found anywhere else. It's a source of organs and hides from exotic creatures, which may be critical components for creating a magic item; if you need the eyes of a luecrotta, the Graywall marketplace may be your best chance. The markets of Droaam also receive the spoils from bandits and odds and ends from deserters, war criminals, and renegades who come from the Five Nations. All in all, you never know what you might find in a goblin market!",
												"In describing goods from Droaam, consider the vast range of styles and quality that can be found throughout the region, some of which are described on the {@table Droaamish Artisanship|ExploringEberron} table. The Barrens raiders had no smiths and fought with simple weapons of wood and stone, or with equipment supplied by Aundair or Karrnath. However, the Daughters have been working to improve the situation, and gnoll and medusa artisans can be found working in many of the more diverse cities. And the Venomous Demesne is a mystically advanced society; while they lack the industrial capacity of House Cannith, they're skilled in producing magecrafted treasures beyond those of the Five Nations. Most magic items used by Droaamites come from the demesne."

												"Droaam is a tapestry of many cultures with diverse beliefs. The minotaurs revere a being known as the Horned Prince, but each clan has its own private name for their patron. The harpies say they sing with the Fury's voice, but believe the Fury was Eberron's cry of pain when she gave birth to the world. The changelings of Lost believe themselves to be the chosen people of the Traveler. The gnolls of the Znir Pact refuse to bow to any god or fiend, while the warlock lords of the Venomous Demesne believe that there is no difference between gods or fiends; there are only powers that can be bound or bargained with.",
												"Despite this vast diversity, there is broad acknowledgment of the Dark Six throughout the region. While each different subculture has its own favored deities and personal twists, most people know the basic principles of the Cazhaak Creed--an interpretation of the Sovereigns and Six codified by the medusas of Cazhaak Draal. Every multicultural city in Droaam has a host of shrines and idols tied to the lesser paths, but the true temple is one of the Shadow, most likely tended by a medusa priest.",
												"The Cazhaak Creed acknowledges that the Sovereigns exist, but portrays them as tyrants who make demands of their worshipers while giving nothing. By contrast, the Dark Six support freedom and fair exchange. Under the creed, the Shadow is the patron of all those considered \"monsters\" by the people of the East. Aureon and the Nine hoarded their power, whereas the Shadow gave its children wondrous gifts: the medusa's gaze, the troll's regeneration, the ogre's strength. As such, the Shadow is the deity most generally invoked by those seeking divine guidance or intervention.",
												"Overall, the Cazhaak Creed assigns the same values to the Dark Six as does the Pyrinean Creed of the Five Nations, but it sees these concepts as virtues. The Shadow is the Sovereign of ambition and helps you find {@i your} path to power, even if that means stepping on others on the way. The Fury is the Sovereign of instinct and if you embrace your emotions, she'll guide you through them; she's also the Sovereign of revenge, which is merely the other side of justice's coin. The Mockery shows the path to victory in battle, even if that requires you to embrace treachery or fear; in Droaam, courage and honor take a back seat to victory and survival. The Devourer wields the power of the wilds; he winnows out the weak, but those who survive his tests grow strong. Priests of the Keeper perform funerary rites, which vary by species--from the medusas that petrify their infirm so they never die, to the trolls and ogres that eat their dead. The priests also act as healers, for disease and infection are tools of the Keeper, and a priest can remove them for a price. The Keeper is the Sovereign of wealth and greed, and his priests are always willing to help a petitioner propose a bargain. The Traveler is rarely worshiped directly by any but the changelings, but it is always acknowledged.",
												"All these are echoed in Droaam in many minor ways. For example, revels are ecstatic celebrations devoted to the Fury, where participants are encouraged to abandon all restraint and embrace their emotions. In battle, many Droaamites dedicate a kill to the Keeper, hoping to earn favor by adding souls to the Sovereign's hoard; likewise, it's customary to sacrifice part of an unexpected windfall to the Keeper so he doesn't grow jealous.",
												"Droaamites are very indulgent of the beliefs of others, despite (or because of) the many different faiths and practices. The Znir gnolls despise demons, but don't interfere with the practices of the minotaurs or tieflings. Harpies don't argue with medusas over the nature of the Fury; they know the true answer, and that's sufficient. Everybody generally honors the Shadow, even if that means different things to different people. This principle generally applies to easterners as well. Droaamites think worshiping the Sovereign Host is foolish, but aren't upset if you invoke Aureon, and don't care what kalashtar or elves believe.",
												"There's one exception to the religious tolerance of Droaam--the Church of the Silver Flame. The Church considers it their mission to defend the innocent from supernatural threats, and many of the inhabitants of Droaam are considered \"supernatural threats.\" The Silver Flame has led many raids and quests into the Barrens, and the Dark Pack won't soon forget the Lycanthropic Purge. Anyone who openly wears symbols of the Silver Flame receives, at best, a hostile reaction from most Droaamites, and it's wise to never wander off alone."

Many of Droaam's inhabitants are carnivorous, and those who aren't lacked the discipline for the large-scale agriculture required to feed large populations like those found today in Graywall or the Great Crag. This simple issue of food kept the population of the Barrens in check.",
												"While the Daughters of Sora Kell enforce their rule with Katra's Voice and Maenya's Fist, they also buy loyalty with food. The Daughters of Sora Kell promise that anyone who serves them will have shelter and sustenance. They have lived up to their promise, providing a seemingly endless supply of food. The staple is a ground meat called grist, served either as stew, pie, or sausage. Grist is tough and sour, but it is filling, and the \"grist mills\" have a seemingly endless supply of it. Few of the people of Droaam know or care where grist comes from, but visitors might be more squeamish--for grist is made of troll meat, ground and processed for consumption. The Daughters of Sora Kell hold the secrets to processing grist, which isn't eaten anywhere else in Khorvaire. On its own, troll meat is highly toxic and carcinogenic, but the Daughters have devised a magical mixture of herbs and spices that's blended with the ground meat and makes it edible.",
												"Every major town has a \"grist mill\"--a public cafeteria serving grist. Grist mills include stables filled with trolls; some are kept as punishment, while others were bred for this purpose. Their flesh is slowly cut away, always leaving time for the creature to safely regenerate--though the pain of this process is still agonizing. The form of grist served in a mill changes daily--stew, sausage, meat broth--but the substance remains the same, and most easterners find it sour and unpleasant. The one saving grace of grist is that it's free. So, enjoy a bowl of grist stew--there's plenty more where it came from!",
												"For those with slivers or teeth to spare, there are many more options. Meat is a staple of Droaamish cuisine, and most like it nearly raw; in fact, many of the lesser giants prefer to eat their meals live. Some food can be downright dangerous for humans; for example, trolls like to chew dried carrion crawler tentacles, which have a dramatic numbing effect on most creatures. Some dishes are served with a tiny living ooze, which Droaamites believe aids with digestion. Wherever you go, the cuisine reflects the exotic beasts of the region. Steamed chuul is much beloved on the coastlines, while spicy displacer beast is popular inland."

The medusa's gaze is a terrifying weapon, but petrification can also be used to preserve the critically injured or sick until they can be properly cared for. Using gargoyles as couriers and harpies as town criers are fairly obvious applications of their natural gifts, while the creation of grist is a more exotic application of troll regeneration. When creating an adventure in Droaam, think about ways in which monstrous gifts could be used in unexpected and useful ways to advance civilization.

While almost all gnolls in Droaam serve as mercenaries with the Znir Pact, there are always those whose services aren't currently contracted. Idle gnolls often work as hunters, selling fresh game to the local markets; grist is sustaining, but there are many creatures who prefer other meat when they can get it."

However, there are still goblins in the domains of some warlords--notably Turakbar's Fist--who live miserable, short lives.

In some ways, this fictive role overlaps with that of the Traveler, but the gifts of the Traveler bring chaos, while those of Sora Katra inevitably bring {@i tragedy.}",

In most of these tales, the champion fails the challenge--which is, to be fair, usually weighted against them--and disaster ensues. But in those rare cases where the protagonist remains true to their ideals or outwits the hag, she always holds true to her promises. It's this penchant for testing resolve and punishing failings that gave birth to the popular tale that if a child makes a promise and breaks their word, Sora Katra will come in the night and take a finger from them.",

In the end of the story, the Woodcutter's Daughter kills the giant in the King's Forest and gives Katra his tongue, and when the curse is lifted, the Woodcutter's Daughter marries the prince. Scholars have long debated Katra's motives in the tale. Is it that she couldn't kill the giant, and was setting a scheme in motion that would lead to his downfall? Or was it actually her goal from the start to elevate the Woodcutter's Daughter--did she create the obstacle in order to give her chosen hero a chance to rise? While this is a positive spin, there's no question that Katra's actions always bring misfortune to {@i someone}--especially those who fail to measure up to her challenges.",
												"Sora Katra is a brilliant orator. In the stories, she usually uses her words to sow doubt or discord, but she is equally capable of binding people together and weaving dreams of glory. In Droaam, she is the voice of the Daughters, and her speeches have drawn a dozen different species together, and made raiders and brigands believe that they are part of something greater and grander than they ever imagined. In part, this is about playing on the peoples' anger and fear of the easterners. But she also has a knack for simply knowing what people want--such as the ambitions of her warlords--and using that to her advantage. Combined with the guidance of Teraza, she foresees problems and invariably finds someone to take the fall for things that cannot be avoided. In some ways, this is the central mystery of Droaam: Why found a nation to begin with? And why seek to be recognized by the Treaty of Thronehold, when Teraza most likely knew the effort would fail? One possibility is that the entire nation is just a stepping-stone toward her true goal--just as the prince in {@i The Sleeping Prince} was a tool that ultimately elevated the Woodcutter's Daughter. It's possible Droaam is another of her tests--but who's being tested, and what happens if they fail? What about the criminal organization Daask? Is this just a diversion for Katra, or is Daask advancing a mysterious agenda?",

She possesses abilities like a powerful bard, both the ability to inspire and to perform powerful enchantments and illusions.",

Perhaps Droaam itself has been created to test the player characters--she's spent a decade and built a nation to force the characters to make a difficult decision. If you want to create a connection between Katra and a character, is the character the archetypal Sleeping Prince--who Katra torments, seemingly without reason--or are they the Woodcutter's Daughter, who may be challenged but has a chance to come out ahead in the end? Consider also the tale of the farmer who became a king. Katra might give a character an artifact, seemingly for no reason; can they use it wisely, or will it lead them to despair? While a connection to Katra could develop during play, you could establish a tie to the Mistress of the Mires in a character's backstory. Perhaps Katra cursed the character's family because of something their parents did; is there something the character can do to lift the curse? Or perhaps the character unwittingly did a favor for a disguised Katra back when they were a child, and she promised to repay this act of kindness; when and how will the character call in this favor?"

While she doesn't lay out schemes as complex as does Sora Katra, there are many tales of Maenya wandering the woods in disguise and tricking travelers into unwise contests. Her endless appetite reflects a broad love of life; it's not simply that she's hungry, it's that she loves to eat. She fights for the sheer joy that comes in crushing an enemy, and in the folk song {@i Edar's Last Jig}, she dances until her partner dies of exhaustion. She seems to have a sense of humor, albeit a morbid one; she may spare someone who makes her laugh, or let someone live because it amuses her to do so. There are stories where a hero beats her in a seemingly impossible contest through cunning and courage; when defeated, she honors any promise she has made. However, a victor would be wise not to gloat; in the tales, this is a sure path to an unexpected end.",

While her primary power is her martial might, she does have supernatural gifts; the most infamous is her soulbinding. And perhaps she also has other necromantic skills that haven't been revealed in the tales...",
												"While she's known for her immense strength, Sora Maenya isn't just a brute; there are stories in which she actually trains a hero, either teaching them to fight or granting them unnatural strength. While it would be an unusual path, a monk or barbarian could attribute their class features to early training with Sora Maenya. The question is whether they knew her identity when she taught them; was she the Reaver of the Woods, or did she teach them in an assumed form? If a character is from the Eldeen Reaches, might they have met Sora Maenya as a child? Perhaps they ran away from home, and Maenya devoured their village while they were away. Or maybe they made an unwise bargain--asking Sora Maenya to kill a childhood rival, which she did; now the character owes her a debt, and someday she'll come to collect. Or perhaps it's the other way around; perhaps as a child, the character defeated Maenya at a game, and it's she who owes the character a favor."

One way to reflect this is to provide them with powers that aren't easily represented or replicated by the standard rules of play. For example, when a character is negotiating with Sora Katra, the DM might ask the player, \"Tell me a time in your childhood when you broke a promise.\" Sora Katra might then bring that story up: \"I watched you through your window that night, warrior. I chose not to take your finger then, for I'd had my fill that evening. But why should I trust you today, when you broke your word to your childhood friend?\"",

But the Daughters are natives of Eberron, not archfey from Thelanis. As such, the Daughters are extremely powerful and long-lived, but they're ultimately mortal; they should be very difficult to kill, but they can die. In addition, archfey largely cannot change, and continue to play out the same story indefinitely. The Daughters are part of Eberron, and as shown by Droaam itself, they may have their preferred themes, but they can create entirely new stories."

												"Sora Teraza is the most enigmatic of the Daughters of Sora Kell. She's known to be blind, yet she's perfectly aware of her surroundings; it's not that she can see, she simply {@i knows} where everything is. In some tales, it's said that she knows when every individual will die; in other stories, she herself chooses when each person will die. It's also said that she has a library in which she keeps books documenting the lives of remarkable people--books that contain the souls of those heroes, and that she appears to collect the soul when that champion is near death.",
												"Sora Teraza is a dusk hag. While she can change her shape, she rarely does so; she wears an old, tattered robe and hides her face beneath a deep hood. She rarely speaks, other than to issue cryptic pronouncements. When she's not with her sisters, she spends her time tending her library in the Great Crag, or in meditation. Teraza is certainly the most gifted oracle of the age. This may be connected to the Draconic Prophecy, or it may be that she perceives the future in a different way. Certainly, Teraza is never depicted as having to seek her answers; it seems she just knows them. Given this unerring knowledge, it would seem like it should be impossible for the Daughters to ever fail; she can reveal the plans of their enemies and the location of any treasure they might seek. But Teraza doesn't always share her knowledge, act in the best interests of her sisters, or even her own interests. Why not? The simplest answer is that she is unhinged; any mind could be broken by the burden of such knowledge. A more complicated possibility is that she is trapped by her own knowledge--that she already knows what she is going to do, and doesn't actually have any real free will. Or perhaps her knowledge isn't as absolute as it appears: she has the potential to know anything, but some things simply evade her sight.",
												"Regardless, Sora Teraza certainly can, and sometimes does, warn her sisters about possible threats, such as treacherous warlords or approaching player characters, and directs them to the best path to ensure victory. But she can also remain silent, or only offer information later than others consider helpful. For example, she could reveal that there's an Aundairian war criminal--a wizard of tremendous skill, who Sora Katra would surely have a use for--hiding out in Graywall. But she might provide this information a year after his arrival, and only a day before he plans to depart--leaving Katra with just 24 hours to mobilize agents to try and capture the wizard. Will these agents compete with the player characters, or will they be the player characters? Teraza might also provide a character with a mysterious piece of information--via {@spell dream} or {@spell sending}--that could be very useful, even if it could hurt her sisters. This doesn't mean she is betraying her sisters; it is simply that she does what she must do, when she must do it. While Sora Teraza's knowledge is potentially limitless, in practice, it's a tool to drive an interesting story, not to derail it."

It's a place where you can interact with creatures that are found nowhere else in Khorvaire, a chance to explore what these creatures can do with their supernatural gifts when they aren't just eating adventurers or sitting on piles of gold.

Do you aspire to become a warlord yourself?",

										"There have always been gnoll clans in the Barrens, though the Dhakaani goblins ruthlessly exterminated gnolls in imperial territories, driving them back into the wilds. But their story starts long before. In the dawn of time, Eberron was the domain of the fiendish overlords. This was an age of chaos, as the overlords constantly clashed with one another. {@creature Rak Tulkesh|ERLW}, the Rage of War, commanded armies of fiends, while the Wild Heart raised hordes of ravenous beasts. In the struggles between the two, the Wild Heart bred dire hyenas with the ability to consume the immortal essences of the Zakya warriors of Rak Tulkhesh. But the Wild Heart failed to anticipate how consuming fiends would affect its creations. Twisted from within by the immortal essence of the demons they'd devoured, the hyenas were warped into something entirely new, something that was neither beast nor demon: and so the first gnolls were born.",
										"Formed from both War and the Wild, gnolls were recruited and bred by both Rak Tulkhesh and the Wild Heart. As foot soldiers of the overlords, they fought against orcs and other early humanoids, as well as battling the gnoll clans of other overlords. Even after the overlords were defeated and bound by the Silver Flame, gnolls continued to be their pawns. The fiendish spark burned within them, and when they weren't directly serving the Lords of Dust, most engaged in vicious acts of brutality. The Rage of War seeks endless battle, and when there is no greater conflict, it delights in setting its minions against one another. For countless generations, gnolls fought troll, ogre, and other gnolls seeking blood for their hungry idols.",
										"Then, centuries ago, two gnolls from rival clans faced one another on a battlefield soaked in the blood of their kin--then questioned the path that had led them there. The two urged others to deny the voice that called for endless war, to refuse to chase death in the service of a fiend. Two became four, then eight, until entire clans heeded the call. Clan leaders dragged their idols to the place now known as {@i Znir}--a word that simply means \"stone\"--and there, they shattered the images of the fiends they once served. Together, the gathered hunters, shamans, and warriors swore an oath: They might be many clans, but from this day forward, they would be one pack. They would allow no one--not chib, god, or demon--to hold dominion over them.",
										"This was easier said than done. Fighting the fiendish influence within was challenging enough, but the Barrens were a chaotic tapestry of battling forces. The leaders of the newly forged Znir Pact had no desire to rule over other creatures, but even just holding territory could invite attack. And so they developed the path that has carried them forward to this day: the road of the mercenary. The gnolls would claim no territory beyond the lands around Znir. They would fight for any who would pay a fair price. But if anyone sought to enslave a gnoll, or to strike against Znir itself, they would face the wrath of all of the united clans. This was a lesson that had to be taught many times, but after a century or so, the point was made. To those who paid them, the gnolls were as reliable as stone. Those who betrayed them or who picked a fight would fall before the might of the full Pact.",
										"Some scholars of the Five Nations find it strange that the Znir Pact never took the path of conquest. There was no parallel to the united force of the Pact within the region, and they could have defeated the various chibs and warlords they served. But the gnolls have never had a desire to rule other creatures; they love the hunt and the thrill of battle. The path of the Pact allows them to do what comes naturally--to stalk and kill, to fight endless battles--but they do so together. They choose the paths they follow and the battles they fight. One could look at the Pact and say that they serve many masters. But the Znir gnoll would respond that they serve only themselves: that they choose who they fight for, they set the terms of their service.",

Typically, mercenary units are comprised of gnolls of a single clan, assigned based on the nature of the task that lies ahead, and contracts are usually negotiated for a period based on cycles of the clan's moon.",

Shamans and leaders from each clan maintain a council at the Znir, around the broken idols. Here they mediate disputes, assign contracts to clans, and allocate funds and equipment. The Eyre clan has honed their skills as smiths and tanners, and they craft much of the equipment used by the Znir gnolls--though there is still a strong tradition of scavenging among the Znir, and warriors often claim trophies from fallen foes."

												"The Znir defied the overlords when they shattered their statues, but there's still a spark of a fiend in the blood of each gnoll. Znir simply refuse to allow the demon within to hold dominion over them. Young gnolls learn how to resist this influence--to channel the strength of the fiend without giving it power over them. For most gnolls, this is a matter of discipline; Znir gnolls are known for remaining calm in the face of provocation, and having learned to fight their own demons, they aren't easily manipulated by mortals. However, some gnolls learn to draw on their unnatural heritage and to channel this power in useful ways. Znir gnolls have their own equivalents of rangers and barbarians; the ranger's primal magic draws on the Wild Heart, while the barbarian channels the fury of the Rage of War. Znir shamans are similar to warlocks, typically following the path of the Fiend. However, in all of these examples, the Znir don't serve the dark power. Rather, they can be seen as stealing their strength from it; learning to draw on it without giving anything in return.",
												"In their determination not to let fiendish forces hold dominion over their people, the Znir gnolls have also developed their own techniques for fighting supernatural threats. Champions trained to face fiends and undead are known as {@i hwyri}--Gnoll for \"warden\"--and wield powers similar to those of paladins in other lands. However, hwyri don't worship any divine power. Their abilities come from training and understanding of the demon within; they aren't crusaders, they're mercenary demon hunters. Most hwyri come from the Vult clan, and in a land that shuns the Silver Flame, these gnolls can be the best hope for people facing fiendish threats. There has been some tension between the Vult and the lycanthropes of the Dark Pack; the Vult shamans suspect that the Pack is vulnerable to the influence of the Wild Heart.",
												"So as a gnoll, there is a spark of demonic influence within you. The Znir learn to control this at an early age. But how does it manifest in you?

Functionally, a myrnaxe is a battleaxe, but it can be used to inflict either slashing damage (with the axe blade) or piercing damage (with the spear). It's common for each head to be made of a different metal, so the spearhead might be silver while the axe blade is made of byeshk--thus maximizing its versatility against multiple foes.",

In addition to those who serve through House Tharashk or Daask, a number of Znir have been sent east to study the Five Nations, gathering knowledge of its people and customs so the Znir council can determine how to engage with the wider world.

This {@i Uul Dhakaan}--Dream of Dhakaan--gave the ancient goblins oneness of culture and purpose, uniting them under Jhazaal Dhakaan as the first {@i marhu}--emperor of Dhakaan. The Dhakaani empire spread across Khorvaire, pushing the dwarves back into the depths of Khyber and driving the dragonborn into the eastern jungles. The Dhakaani repelled Tairnadal colonists, and drove orcs, gnolls, and other minor cultures into the wild frontiers.",
										"The golden age of Dhakaan lasted over five millennia, with goblins ruling over the lands that would later be claimed by Galifar. As the legend suggests, this prosperous era ended with the Xoriat incursion, when the daelkyr led armies of aberrations into Khorvaire. The daelkyr destroyed Dhakaani cities and transformed goblinoids into aberrations, such as dolgaunts and dolgrims. After a long and bitter struggle, Dhakaani champions turned the tide. The orc Gatekeeper druids bound the daelkyr in Khyber, but it was Dhakaani warriors who scattered their armies and hunted down the beasts that survived. But as legend tells, the daelkyr achieved victory even in defeat. Dyrrn the Corruptor created a psychic contagion that severed goblinoids from the Uul Dhakaan, and further encouraged chaotic behavior and irrational beliefs. Leaders among the {@i duur'kala}--dirge singers looked to for wisdom and guidance--identified the threat but couldn't find a way to stop it; isolation was the only answer. Determined to preserve their culture, Dhakaani forces sealed themselves in subterranean fortresses, vowing to return only after the {@i Kapaa'vola}--the Treacherous Whisper--had faded. These armies called themselves the {@i Kech Dhakaan}, Keepers of the Empire--a term still used today to encompass all Dhakaani clans.",
										"On the surface, the remnants of the empire fragmented and collapsed. As far as the Kech Dhakaan are concerned, the history of the Empire of Dhakaan came to an end the moment Dyrrn the Corruptor unleashed the Kapaa'vola. But in truth, the empire lingered for centuries after the Keepers left; the wider world doesn't even know the term Kapaa'vola, and history books consider the fall of Dhakaan to be a long and ugly affair. Dyrrn's curse caused paranoia and wild beliefs to flourish, further driving the survivors apart. The discipline and knowledge of Dhakaan were lost, and the traditions of the daashor--artificers of Dhakaan--and the duur'kala were forgotten. New religions and cults emerged. Some tribes embraced the Dark Six, while others revered a wider pantheon. Under Dhakaan, the goblinoid subspecies were united; in the wake of the Kapaa'vola, the strong dominated the weak. Some tribes developed unusual and complex traditions, while others were cruel and feral. When human explorers found these warring tribes living in the ruins of grand cities, many assumed that the goblinoids had claimed the remnants of a human civilization they destroyed. This false narrative was used to justify countless atrocities. Humanity slowly displaced the goblinoids, seizing the lands that once belonged to Dhakaan. Goblins were often subjugated, while bugbears and hobgoblins were driven into the wilds or the upper levels of Khyber. In time scholars learned the truth--that the foundations they'd built upon were goblin cities, not human. But few people cared; in their eyes, the goblinoids were merely savages, children of the Dark Six, dangerous and cruel. It was in this time that the terms {@i goblin, bugbear,} and {@i hobgoblin} took root, even among the former dar themselves.",
										"The oppression of goblins persisted for more than a thousand years, while bugbears and hobgoblins remained hostile forces in the fringes, dwelling in the wild lands ignored by humanity. When Galifar Wynarn began his conquest of the Five Nations, he promised freedom to any goblin who fought under his banner, Goblin soldiers played a vital role in the war that followed, and Galifar remained true to his word. Despite this freedom, goblins were still often treated with prejudice and suspicion, and denied education and other tools for success. Even today, goblins can be found in every major city of the Five Nations, but an overwhelming number live in poverty.",
										"In the shadow of Galifar, goblinoid cultures continued to develop and evolve. The most widespread were the Ghaal'dar tribes of the Seawall Mountains. While they remained severed from the Uul Dhakaan and knew nothing of the hidden Keepers, the Ghaal'dar recovered scraps of their ancient history. The hobgoblins pursued {@i muut} and {@i atcha}--their duty to their people and their personal honor--though they knew these only as abstract concepts. They honed their anger against the {@i chaat'oor}\u2013the non-native defilers--who had stolen their ancient lands. Some of the Ghaal'dar tribes served as mercenaries during the Last War, learning more about the chaat'oor in the process.",
										"And then in 969 YK, chieftain Haruuc of the Rhukaan Taash led the uprising that claimed the lands of southern Cyre and founded the nation known as Darguun. Little did he know that other eyes were watching. Khesh'dar scouts and spies had been gathering information on the world above since the beginning of the Last War. The founding of Darguun made it even easier for the Silent Folk to move within the world. The duur'kala of the Kech Dhakaan concluded that the Kapaa'vola had faded; these Ghaal'dar might be victims of the daelkyr curse, but associating with them posed no threat to the Uul Dhakaan. And so, over the last two decades, the Keepers of Dhakaan have emerged from their vaults and returned to the world above.",

When used in lowercase--ghaal'dar--it refers to a hobgoblin of the Kech Dhakaan. However, when capitalized--Ghaal'dar--it's the name of the federation of hobgoblin-dominated tribes that dominate modern Darguun. The Ghaal'dar tribes are not Dhakaani; they mimic some of their customs and are proud of their imperial history, but they were twisted by the Kapaa'vola and differ from the dar in many important ways.",
												"Likewise, {@i dar} means \"people.\" While common in the Goblin language, within this book, it's generally used to refer to the Dhakaani goblinoids who were unaffected by the Kapaa'vola. Today, the Ghaal'dar and other Darguuls have largely adopted the human words for their kind--goblin, hobgoblin, and bugbear. Dar--the golin'dar, ghaal'dar, and guul'dar--are the original goblinoids who resisted daelkyr corruption."

The Uul Dhakaan also retains the memories of all those who have gone before. While dreaming in the Uul Dhakaan, a warrior could experience a battle against the daelkyr that occurred thousands of years ago, fighting alongside one of the greatest heroes of that age. A smith could forge a blade alongside a legendary daashor. These things aren't real; both the hero and the smith are dreams, pieced together through memory. And as with any dream, the dreamer likely won't remember most of it after they wake up. But it remains in their subconscious as a source of inspiration and instinct.

Recalling the name \"Dhakaan\" requires a successful DC 10 Intelligence (History) check. With a DC 15 check, a character also knows broad details--the territory controlled by the empire, the timeline of its rise and fall, the role of the subspecies, and its clashes with other cultures. A DC 20 check provides very detailed information: the importance of muut and atcha, the names of specific rulers, perhaps even the knowledge of the Kapaa'vola and the belief that some clans fled from this threat. Goblinoids of Darguun are more broadly familiar with their history, and would certainly know the name of the Empire of Dhakaan, know about the duur'kala and the Silent Clans, and understand the idea of muut and atcha, even if they don't experience these concepts in the same way as the dar. Darguuls must still make a history check to recall the names of specific heroes or events tied to the empire, but generally receive advantage on such checks.",
												"So this is what people know about the fallen empire--but what about the Kech Dhakaan and its many clans? Do people know the origin and goals of the Keepers? This is more complicated, as the Kech Dhakaan have chosen to hide in plain sight. Before Darguun, goblinoid tribes and clans were scattered across the wilds of Khorvaire. When Haruuc established his nation, many unknown tribes stepped out of the shadows to take a place in his court. This was a perfect opportunity for the Kech Dhakaan and its Silent Clans. Two of these clans, the Kech Volaar and the Kech Shaarat have both revealed themselves to the Darguuls; but they have concealed their age, their power, and their resources. The Ghaal'dar know the Kech Volaar as an isolated clan of scholars with talented duur'kala. They know the Kech Shaarat as proud and deadly warriors. But the Ghaal'dar don't know that these clans have a direct tie to the ancient empire, that they possess powerful Dhakaani relics and daashor artificers, or that these clans are preparing to choose a new emperor of their own. Likewise, the Ghaal'dar don't know anything about the Uul Dhakaan, and they don't understand the fundamental differences between the modern goblins and the ancient dar. And because the Kech Dhakaan hide their true numbers and capabilities, the Ghaal'dar don't realize just how powerful these clans are; most of the Ghaal'dar tribes believe that the kech are small and somewhat backward, out of touch with modern life.",

When traveling abroad, the Heirs of Dhakaan generally take advantage of the broad ignorance of goblin culture, allowing people to assume that they're Darguul mercenaries.

There is honor in using cunning to defeat a superior foe, so guerilla warfare, ambushing a foe, and even assassination are acceptable tactics, if this is what muut requires. Dar must be ready to die for the empire--but when possible, it's always better to kill for the empire.

This principle doesn't apply to the modern goblinoids of Darguun, the \"bugbears\" and \"hobgoblins.\" Physically, these creatures are dar, but they don't know the Uul Dhakaan, and they don't understand muut as the dar do. The leaders of the Kech Shaarat believe that while it may be possible to use the Darguuls, ultimately, they are not dar and must be treated as enemies. Some of the Kech Volaar are searching for a way to reconcile to these lost kin, expanding the Uul Dhakaan, undoing the damage of the Kapaa'vola and restoring its victims to the fold. Others among the Volaar argue that coexistence should be considered, that the isolationism of the empire must be reconsidered in the face of the widespread, powerful nations of the modern age.

Rather, they consider it inefficient to try to force their values and traditions on creatures who have no concept of muut and who don't share the Uul Dhakaan. Thus, Dhakaani tradition has always been to drive enemies out of their territories, or if such exile is impossible, to kill them.

												"When the empire was at its height, the daashor and duur'kala could create grand artifacts and eldritch machines, such as {@i Ghaal'duur} and the {@i grieving tree} presented in chapter 7. The creation of such artifacts was never trivial, and relied on remarkable talents, knowledge lost during the daelkyr incursion, and the use of rare substances and planar conjunctions. As such, while it's possible for the Dhakaani to create new artifacts, they are primarily concerned with recovering and reclaiming ancient treasures forged in the past. The Kech Dhakaan are deeply concerned about how many of their treasures have been claimed by chaat'oor, and react with anger toward other species carrying Dhakaani relics."

Each of these units took responsibility for preserving one of the pillars of the empire. Together, they called themselves the {@i Kech Dhakaan}--the Keepers of the Empire. The name of each individual clan was given based on their chosen ideal; thus the Kech Volaar are Keepers of the Word, and the Kech Shaarat are Keepers of the Sword. Uul'kala helped to coordinate this effort and to maintain communication between the isolated vaults over time, but there are kech vaults that never had uul'kala, and others who lost their uul'kala over time.",

This section expands on the clans named in that chapter, including descriptions of some Keeper clans that are known or active. This isn't intended to be a complete list, and DMs should feel free to add additional kech--whether they have been in communication with the others or have been in isolation--or to remove kech from this list if they don't fit the story of a campaign.",

One of their leaders, Khaas Dhakaan, had no interest in hiding. Gathering the greatest heroes of the age--Dhakaani champions, Khesh'dar assassins, Gatekeeper orcs--Khaas led his army into the depths of Khyber, and into the demiplane that served as the prison of Dyrrn the Corruptor. Khaas swore to end the Treacherous Whisper and to recover artifacts stolen by Dyrrn and its minions--artifacts that Khaas believed could restore the splintering empire.",
												"Khaas and his champions were never heard from again, neither in the waking world or in the Uul Dhakaan, and it was assumed that they were lost. In truth, they were trapped within Dyrrn's demiplane, fighting an endless struggle against the minions of the daelkyr. Time moves strangely in Dyrrn's realm, and by the reckoning of the Ghaalrac, it has been less than three centuries since they set out on their mission. Trapped in a realm of madness, the Ghaalrac have blended Dhakaani and Gatekeeper techniques with the symbionts of the daelkyr, with results that others might find horrifying. They have crafted powerful living weapons and artifacts, along with magebred champions with unnatural powers--armored bugbears with the regenerative abilities of trolls, goblin assassins with the ability to slip through space. They have found ways to bind aberrations to their will, and have forced beholders and grells to serve them.",
												"The descendants of the Gatekeeper orcs that ventured into Khyber with the Kech Ghaalrac remain to this day, having found their own place in the clan's caste system as specialists in druidic magic. However, the traditions carried by these onceGatekeepers vary greatly from their surface counterparts, in part because they've been cut off from the natural world. While still driven by the goal of fighting aberrations, after hundreds of years in an alien land, the orcs of the Kech Ghaalrac would seem similarly alien to other Gatekeepers.",
												"Now, after centuries of struggle in Khyber, the Kech Ghaalrac have returned. The current leader--who also uses the name Khaas--possesses what the Ghaalrac call {@i Ur'taash}, the \"First Crown.\" It's said that this was the final creation of Jhazaal Dhakaan, forged to unite the empire; it protects his mind, allows him to communicate with Ghaalrac squads across great distances, and possesses powerful coercive abilities. Khaas claims to have torn this crown from Dyrrn's grip as he dealt a mortal blow to the Corruptor. He believes that it is the Ghaalrac who broke the power of the Treacherous Whisper, and that only they can restore the Empire of Dhakaan.",
												"Khaas and the other leaders of the Kech Ghaalrac carry the names of heroes of ancient Dhakaan: Torrm of the Gatekeepers, the master assassin known only as Khesh, the mighty guul'dar Korrga. The original heroes are long dead, but these dar claim to be their descendants and carry their ancient weapons. They possess tremendous power, and they intend to use it. But there are many questions about the Kech Ghaalrac. Are they truly what they claim to be, or have they been corrupted by Dyrrn and turned into tools of the daelkyr, whether they realize it or not? They aren't part of the Uul Dhakaan as experienced by the other Keepers, but they have their own version of the dream that sustained them through the long war, and believe that it is the other clans who have lost sight of the dream. The other Keepers will know nothing of the Kech Ghaalrac until the Clan of Heroes reveals itself; will they support Khaas Dhakaan of their own volition, or be compelled by the power of {@i Ur'taash}? Or will the Heirs of Dhakaan oppose these transformed heroes?",
												"The Kech Ghaalrac can appear anywhere that suits the needs of the campaign. When they appear, it should be dramatic. One option is for them to seize the Gathering Stone, House Deneith's fortress in Darguun; this strikes a dramatic blow against chaat'oor and gives the Ghaalrac an opportunity to bend Darguuls to their will. Khaas Dhakaan believes that dar and Darguul alike are all flawed--but that all can be redeemed by the power of Ur'taash.",
												"The Kech Ghaalrac is an unlikely origin for a player character; their story works best when people don't know if they have been corrupted or are righteous, despite their unnatural tools and techniques. However, a Dhakaani character from another kech could be determined to uncover the truth about the Kech Ghaalrac. Or a character could be the distant descendant of one of the Ghaalrac heroes, seeking to learn the final fate of their ancestor and to recover a prized relic from the Ghaalrac champion who carries it."

Spying and assassination remained the domain of the Khesh'dar, but the Kech Nasaar served both as internal security and as commandos specializing in guerilla tactics and psychological warfare. It was the Kech Nasaar who first recognized the threat of the Kapaa'vola, and set the Keeper seclusion in motion.",

Under the leadership of Iraala and Muurat, the Nasaar have also explored the arts of necromancy, though it's up to the DM to decide just how far they've continued down this path. Do they have squads of vampire commandos? Have they developed entirely new forms of undead? Given their penchant for psychological warfare, Nasaar agents could sow terror and confusion by raising the bones of soldiers who died in the Last War, making it seem like the vengeful dead yearned to continue the battle. Or perhaps the Nasaar have developed techniques allowing them to seize control of undead raised by other necromancers--a technique that could cause untold chaos in Karrnath.",

The edict of a long-dead emperor asserted that no dead creature could wear the imperial crown; while the services of the Nasaar were valued, the dead are severed from the Uul Dhakaan and cannot draw on the wisdom of the past or see Jhazaal's dream. The Nasaar could have fallen into true darkness in their isolation, and now seek to seize power for themselves. On the other hand, despite being cut off from the Uul Dhakaan, Iraala and Muurat remember the actual glory of the fallen empire, and could be the truest devotees of the concepts of muut and atcha, placing the needs of the empire above their personal ambitions. As in ancient times, they might seek to guide the living emperor, and to ensure the Dhakaani Empire follows the proper course.",

A Nasaar dar might be gathering information for the clan, or they could be tasked to monitor the activities of the other Keepers, especially the Kech Ghaalrac and Kech Shaarat.

But the Kech Ruuska breed all manner of beasts, from fierce guardians to clever messengers and simple livestock.",

However, the Kech Ruuska specialize in breeding and training them, producing the finest Beast Master rangers, and keeping the widest range of exotic creatures in their arsenals. The Ruuska also work with magebreeding and may have produced entirely new beasts or monstrosities previously unknown on the surface.

The Ruuska have also experimented with lycanthropy. It's up to the DM to decide if they were able to control and weaponize the curse, if their efforts ultimately came to nothing, or if lycanthropy has spread throughout the Ruuska--a secret they are concealing from the other clans.",

The Kech Shaarat are putting considerable pressure on the Ruuska to support their claim to the crown. It remains to be seen if Lhaar bows to these threats, or whether the Ruuska seek an alliance that lets them turn the tables on the powerful Shaarat.",

While they lack the exotic specialties of the other clans, the Kech Shaarat excel at war. The deep vault of the Kech Shaarat is tied to a demiplane in Khyber known as the Ironlands. This provided them with access to resources and space denied to the other clans, including the byeshk ore the Dhakaani prize for their weapons (as presented in chapter 7), while also keeping them on a constant war footing. Of all the Keepers, the Kech Shaarat have the finest Forge Adept artificers (a new specialization presented in chapter 6), as well as talented Battle Smiths--though the Dhakaani don't generally employ constructs, these artificers have created innovative steel defenders.

In the course of this expansion, the Kech Shaarat have already absorbed a lesser clan--the Kech Nozhii, who maintained the treasury of the empire--which has expanded their resources.

House Deneith is keen to gain the services of these mysterious warriors, but Ruus Dhakaan refuses to have any dealings with the chaat'oor. Ruus Dhakaan is a brilliant strategist and charismatic leader. He earned {@i Skai Shaarat} with his courage and skill, and should never be underestimated. While he's determined to claim the imperial throne, he's also concerned with muut and the good of the empire; he will pressure other Keepers to support his claim, but won't butcher his own kind. However, he's ruthless when it comes to dealing with chaat'oor, and doubts whether the modern \"goblins\" can be redeemed. They may be close enough to dar that they could be worthy servants, but he's considering whether it's simpler to slaughter the Darguuls once the dar are united.",

A lone Shaarat dar could be an exile from the clan or a spy evaluating the strengths and fighting styles of the chaat'oor.

They can serve as a neutral resource supporting all clans, maintaining communication and offering guidance through the dream. However, it could be that they're not what they seem. The Kech Uul have always worked to protect Jhazaal's dream from outside influences, but it's possible the clan has been partially or fully replaced by quori imposters, who plan to influence the Emperor Yet to Come to serve the ends of the Dreaming Dark. Or perhaps the Kech Uul was destroyed long ago by the daelkyr or another threat; the Dream Keepers continue to serve their function, but they're actually long dead, and the chot'uul encountered in the Uul are simply dream-vestiges, memories lingering in Dal Quor.",

Or do the Khesh'dar have a hidden agenda of their own? Is it possible that they're tied to the Lords of Dust... or even to the dragons of the Chamber?",

More likely, a single character could be an undercover operative of the Khesh'dar, either pursuing a deep, long-term mission or simply gathering intelligence while waiting for specific orders. It's not unusual for the Khesh'dar to seek to cultivate useful allies among the gath'dar.

The whereabouts of {@i Guulen} and {@i Ghaal'duur} remain unknown. Beyond this, Tuura is evaluating the modern world, working to see if others could be useful allies. So while the Kech Shaarat remain convinced that this conflict is solely based on dominance within the dar, the Kech Volaar believe that knowledge of the modern world is vital to any long-term success.",

Instead, guul'dar \"rage\" is a cultivated surge of adrenaline and combat awareness, not unlike the Fighting Spirit of the Samurai fighter. The Path of the Totem Warrior is the common choice for guul'dar barbarians; the choice of totem doesn't reflect a primal spirit, but rather specialized combat training. If your DM approves of this concept, you might even be able to replace the 10th-level Spirit Walker feature with the Intimidating Presence of the Berserker barbarian, as it's difficult to explain how commune with nature is tied to your military training."

They cling to property, whether it's land or more portable possessions. They're fierce in protecting the things that they care about. But as the bard Kessler said, \"The Mror care deeply about their stories, but facts just get in the way.\" Mror talespinners have an endless supply of stories about the mighty deeds of clan heroes, but when it comes to specific dates or verifiable facts, things often get muddy. Records of debts, marriages, adoptions--these things are written down by Sivis scribes. But general history is largely trusted to the passed-down tales of the spinners, and they make history {@i interesting}. A particular story could be placed in three different centuries by three different clans, and the villain of one tale could be the hero in the neighboring holdfast.",

Most spinners concur that the dwarves came from a land of ice and frost, though as seen in the epigraph opening this section, not all stories agree. While that's enough for the Mror, other scholars continue to debate where they might have originated and how they traveled to Khorvaire. The most popular theory is that the first dwarves came from the Frostfell, traveling by way of a demiplane passage through Khyber. Proponents of this idea believe that there may be an undiscovered dwarven civilization--or ruins of it--waiting to be found in the Frostfell. A second popular theory is that the dwarves originated in the Tashana Tundra of Sarlona, sailing to Khorvaire and landing in the Lhazaar Principalities millennia before human settlers. However, the modern Akiak dwarves have little cultural overlap with the Mror, and there's no evidence that they ever built ships. The most exotic story is that the dwarves of Sarlona and Khorvaire both came from Risia, and that there may still be a grand hidden civilization deep in the Risian ice. While origin stories vary from clan to clan, the talespinners all agree on the broad eras of Mror history that followed.",

Dhakaani dirge singers sing of battles between dwarf and dar that took place in vast halls below the earth. Dhakaani records--which are more accurate than those of the dwarves--show that the Dhakaani encountered dwarves late in the golden age of the Dhakaani Empire and drove them east, eventually reaching a stalemate. The ancient dwarves lacked the numbers or resources to threaten Dhakaan, but they established a line below the Ironroot Mountains and held it against countless onslaughts. The dar had no need of the territory, and in time, decided the effort of conquest wasn't worth the rewards. This was the origin of what the dwarves call {@i Sol Udar}, the Realm Below."

At some point--whether years or centuries later is unclear--a group of dwarven warriors were exiled from the Realm Below, and found a new home in the mountains above, along with their families and followers. The reason for the Exile depends on who you ask. Mroranon talespinners say King Mror of Sol Udar couldn't decide which of his thirteen heirs should inherit his throne, so he pushed these heroes out onto the mountain to prove themselves worthy of his kingdom. The Soldorak say that King Mror was a weak tyrant, and he exiled the thirteen heroes because he feared an uprising. Professor Melian Mit Davandi of Korranberg has advanced the theory that the ancient dwarves may have exiled criminals to the surface world instead of maintaining prisons, and the founders of the Mror Holds were a broad assortment of criminals and undesirables. The truth is buried beneath the weight of thousands of years and may never be known."

Even as humans spread across the land, the dwarves continued to devote their energy and resources to their own ongoing vendettas. While they were unquestionably fierce warriors and made fine weapons, their deep division prevented any progress. The Ironroot dwarves weren't the only dwarves on Khorvaire; some had spread east into what's now the Lhazaar Principalities.

Early explorers found finely crafted treasures, along with evidence of even deeper mines and fortresses.

The first explorers found curious tools formed from flesh and bone--and then they discovered the creatures that made them. Dolgrim hordes rose from the depths.

												"The Mror Holds are a feudal society, comprised of holds, spires, and families. There are twelve active holds, each governed by a ruling clan, which gives its name to the hold--so Droranathhold is ruled by Clan Droranath. Each hold is then broken up into smaller territories known as spires, each ruled by a clan; there are ancient ties of kinship and marriage between clans and the ruling clan. Within a spire, families maintain tenant relationships with the local clan. Land is held by a clan or family, and most businesses are family businesses. Families are long established, and the creation of a new family is an extremely rare event.",
												"The Mror engage with their history through stories, and clans and families are the characters in those stories. Typically, a Mror tale refers to heroes and villains solely by their family names. So in {@i Mroranon and the Troll King}, it doesn't matter exactly when the story took place or which specific Mroranon it was; it's a story about {@i Mroranon}. In one tale, he is a heroic youth, and in another, she is a battle-scarred veteran, and yet they're depicted as the same Mroranon. And in both cases, all Mroranon dwarves should strive to live up to that example. Where the Tairnadal elves seek to emulate specific ancestors, Mror dwarves view their family as a greater whole. Your family is a direct extension of your identity; it's only natural that you'd help a family member in need, and betraying a family member is like stabbing yourself in the hand. This drives feuds and alliances; if you're wronged by a Hronnath dwarf, the blame lies with Clan Hronnath, not simply the individual. To draw another comparison to the elves, the Aereni preserve their ancestors as deathless undead. In contrast, the Mror don't feel that need to preserve individuals; you preserve your family by living up to its character and by adding to its story. The Mror also aren't as particular about precisely following the traditions of ancestors, as shown by the clans that are embracing symbionts; what you do is less important than how you do it, the values you stand for, and the lines you refuse to cross.",
												"This doesn't mean that Mror don't take personal responsibility for their actions or feel pride in their personal deeds. The deeds of living dwarves are generally acknowledged by name, but when they take their place in history, their names are unlikely to be remembered. Instead, every dwarf hopes that their grand deeds will be added to the trove of stories told of their family--and that they won't shame their family with the memories of their misdeeds.",
												"In creating a Mror character or NPC, consider your family. Are you part of a clan or ruling clan? If so, are you close enough to power to take the noble background, or are you a lesser heir? Are you from a tenant family, and if so, what is your family's business? Even more crucial, what is your family's {@i character}? When people tell stories about your family, what are the virtues they highlight? Are there any particular things your family is known for, any celebrated deeds you might emulate, or anything a member of your family should never do? Some families have specific taboos; a Tronnan must never break their word, while a Holladon never turns away a guest. Does your family have any such traditions?",
												"Also consider how your family was affected by the Dol Udar. Did they invest deeply in the depths, only to suffer grievous losses when the horrors rose? Did they fight on the front lines, or largely remain above? Do they have a family treasure recovered from the Realm Below--a legendary item or artifact you might someday have the honor to wield? Are they willing to embrace symbionts, or are they disgusted by the tools of the daelkyr?",
												"Finally, what is your standing with your family? If it's good, consider why you left the Mror Holds; chapter 1 of {@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW} includes a table with suggestions for this. If your standing is bad, what happened? Is it a situation you hope to fix, or have you turned your back on your family? As a player, talk to your DM about the role your family might play in a campaign; do you want to have cousins showing up in need of assistance or to be drawn into new feuds, or would you rather your family remain in your backstory?"

												"The Mror attitude toward family is one example of how they deal with their long lives. A dwarf can live to be up to 350 years old; intellectually, they mature at about the same rate as humans, but they generally aren't considered to be full adults until around 50 years of age. This ties to the fact that dwarves have a low fertility rate and their reproductive peak is between 50 and 120. While under 50, a Mror dwarf is usually learning the family trade and working directly for their parents, uncles, or aunts; at 50 and above, a dwarf starts thinking about starting their own branch of the family tree and the family trade.",

To them, the story matters more than the concrete facts. Individuals come and go, but the family remains, and the story continues. And the Mror deeply love stories. Like the dar, they prefer stories to be based on fact as opposed to being absolute fiction--but to the Mror, a story should always be entertaining, and as long as the spirit is true, it's fine to exaggerate the details. So while the talespinner bard serves as a keeper of history, their role as entertainers is as important--if not more so--than their role as sage.",
												"Mror dwarves can be seen as boastful by outsiders, quick to share tales of their exploits. However, they don't seek to dominate every conversation with their tales, but expect others to share their stories as well--and if others don't, Mror are quick to boast about the deeds of their companions. Anyone who spends much time around Mror quickly grows used to the phrase {@i Tol kollan}--or the Common translation, \"That reminds me of a story.\" Mror hate quick meetings; any gathering should have time for tales. In playing a Mror character, you might come up with a few stories you love, as well as taking joy in dramatically retelling the story of your adventures--the deeds of both you and your fellow adventurers--celebrating and highlighting your finest moments."

But a family treasure can also be a mundane item that has been a part of many epic stories. As noted earlier, no one cares which specific Mroranon heir was the hero of {@i Mroranon and the Troll King}. But if the house still has the bracer that hero made from the troll king's nose ring, carrying this relic is a tremendous source of pride.

The {@i dultar}--blood blade--is a dagger worn both as a utilitarian tool and as a statement of allegiance; each of the ruling clans has a distinct style of dultar.

Living clothing typically has a texture similar to leather, though chitin plating or hornlike protrusions are possible.

The Londurak prepared their defenses for a surface attack... but it never came. This pattern was repeated in other spires and holds; though the reasons are unclear, Dyrrn's forces won't pursue their enemies beyond Sol Udar."

												"Nobody's sure why the aberrations avoid attacking the surface in force. Sages theorize it's tied to the wards that bind Dyrrn within its demiplane, and the aberrations only venture so far from the realm of their master. Or perhaps it's just a tactical choice. Regardless of the reason, the war has been in a stalemate over the last few years. But many sages believe that complacency is foolish, and until they know with absolute certainty what keeps Dyrrn's forces from rising to the surface, they can't know their protection will last. And even if the dolgrim hordes won't leave the tunnels and there's no threat of a large-scale assault, the Slithering Lord could be unfolding more subtle schemes.",
												"Londurakhold and Tordannonhold have both pulled back from the war, fortifying all passages to the Realm Below and forbidding any traffic with the depths; they ignore the Realm Below, believing that if they don't poke the stirge's nest, the aberrations won't threaten them. Most of the other major clans maintain lines in the depths, defending claimed mines and colonies with steel and blood. These territories are secured by heavy fortifications, strong enough to repel attack, though serving on the line is a dangerous job. But the dwarves aren't trying to press beyond their current lines, for if they venture across it, their fate is unknown.",
												"The future of the war remains unclear. Many of the clan lords yearn to press deeper. But there have been all too many casualties over the past few decades, and there is still considerable fear that the current lull is a trick--that Dyrrn is building forces for a renewed assault. And no one knows if there is a way to win the war once and for all, or if it's just a matter of advancing the line another hundred feet. Ultimately, it's up to the DM to decide whether the war remains as a lurking threat, or if it heats up and dominates the story."

Psychic attacks, unnatural diseases, and other threats can emanate from the depths.",
												"In the past three decades, the touch of Dyrrn has become seen even in the children born to the Mror dwarves. Very rarely, an infant born to ordinary parents is different. Known as ruinbound dwarves, these unusual infants are born with a personal symbiont bound to them, along with other unnerving mutations--and unexpected powers. Chapter 6 contains more information about ruinbound dwarves (and their reception amongst the Mror), along with a playable subrace.",

No one knows the full size of the Realm Below, though it appears to stretch across the Ironroot Mountains, and connects to multiple demiplanes in Khyber. There's a good chance it exists below every major Mror city, but not every spire has broken through and made a connection to Sol Udar. When creating adventures in a Mror city, decide if there is an established passage to the Realm Below; if so, is it a simple passage, or is there a subterranean fortress or colony? In a spire with no known connection, a cult could be secretly digging to try to reach their aberrant masters. Or a clan could have opened a passage beneath its keep but lacked the courage to explore it--a job for adventurers."

												"To an outsider, the idea of pressing into the Realms Below may seem like madness, but several factors drive the ongoing Mror presence in the depths. The first is a hunger for the wonders that lie below. The ancient dwarves possessed the ability to craft legendary objects and artifacts. They understood Khyber's systems of demiplanes in a way even the Dhakaani haven't mastered; many clan lords dream of bottomless mines or resources that can't be found in the natural world. Beyond the innate desire for these things, for the Mror, it's a matter of pride. Sol Udar is the work of their ancestors. The knowledge that it holds, the untold wealth, this is their birthright. It's a burning reminder that they could be more than they are now--they could be greater than the Five Nations or the Aereni. Additionally, many dwarves are driven by their desire to know the story--to understand who their ancestors were and what became of them.",
												"If a player character is a Mror noble, the Realm Below can be a tempting opportunity for advancement. The clans hold all lands below their territory. If a noble with a stalwart band of allies can secure an outpost in Sol Udar and fortify against the forces of Dyrrn, they can claim it as their personal estate. This could be a remarkable keep for a party of adventurers--if they are powerful enough to maintain it! The {@table Realm Below Story Hooks|ExploringEberron} table contains some more ideas for why adventurers might delve into the Realm Below.",
												"The lines between regions secured by the Mror and those held by Dyrrn's forces are clearly marked. As the aberrations generally don't come to the surface, there are places where the uppermost passage has simply been sealed with magic and steel. In other places where the dwarves have established colonies, the edge of the colony is heavily fortified and patrolled by soldiers, ever alert for some new attack. In most cases, soldiers won't prevent someone from proceeding into the depths--but anyone returning goes through careful scrutiny to ensure they haven't been infected by unnatural influences. And if an explorer has returned with treasures, it's considered polite to offer a gift to the guardians."

												"The Realm Below blends the civilization of Sol Udar with the alien touch of the daelkyr. The dwarves of Sol Udar were an advanced civilization employing arcane science beyond that currently possessed by the Five Nations. The halls were shaped by elemental magic--an improved form of the {@spell move earth} spell--and reinforced to be stronger than any natural stone. Barring any alien influence, the air is renewed by magic and remarkably fresh; a permanent prestidigitation effect keeps these halls clean after thousands of years and untold conflicts. Ultimately, venturing into this environment can be somewhat eerie: though there may have been a brutal battle there just months ago, the halls are silent and pristine.",
												"Widespread magic was a part of daily life in Sol Udar. Explorers might find a chamber where illusory music begins to play as soon as someone enters, or discover a theater still performing ancient entertainment. Many doors are sealed by {@spell arcane lock||arcane locks}, and high-security areas may have self-restoring {@spell glyph of warding||glyphs of warding} or more sophisticated security. The people of Sol Udar weren't warlike by nature. Their halls contain great forges and foundries, but many of their wonders are utilitarian. An Udar kitchen has tools that replicate the heating, chilling, and flavoring effects of {@spell prestidigitation}, and might have a builtin {@item alchemy jug} to dispense whatever liquids are needed. Of course, not all enchantments are automatically noticeable, and many effects require some form of command word or gesture to activate; modern colonists who have settled in the upper levels of Sol Udar are still struggling to understand the full capabilities of their new home.",
												"The dwarves of Sol Udar also took advantage of the many demiplanes that lie within Khyber, identifying passages to them and building around them, just as the people of the surface build around manifest zones. A typical demiplane portal is clearly marked and heavily secured, of great potential value--and danger--as they can break the laws of the natural world. Demiplanes are entirely unpredictable in size, some no larger than a town, with others the size of Khorvaire itself. Within a demiplane, time might run differently. Gemstones could grow on trees. A demiplane can have its own sun, and provide vegetation and other resources that couldn't be found in any natural cave. But a demiplane could also hold strange curses, unnatural diseases, or deadly creatures--or in the case of Dyrrn's prison-realm, all three.",
												"The Realm Below isn't one single contiguous community. It was an entire nation, one that stretched at least the length of the Ironroot Mountains. There are major cities, small outposts, and long passages connecting them. The Realm Below likely had some form of rapid transit: Teleportation circles? Something similar to the lightning rail? A system tied to demiplanes? Whatever this was, it has yet to be discovered, and may lie on the lower levels held by Dyrrn's minions. In creating a section of the Realm Below for an adventure, the DM should think about the purpose of this particular area. Was it an industrial center? A residential community? A hospital? A prison? If it contains a passage to a demiplane, the nature of the demiplane should relate to the function of the community; if it's a hospital, perhaps the local demiplane has alien vegetation that has remarkable medicinal properties. But what unknown threats could dwell in the demiplane--threats the ancient dwarves knew to avoid?"

												"Dyrrn's minions have spread throughout the lower reaches of Sol Udar. Areas inhabited by aberrations are generally easy to spot. Often, organic matter covers the surfaces of the buildings. Explorers have encountered fleshlike coating, with tendrils of muscle spread out like spiderwebs; organic fluids that move along the walls, a harmless form of living ooze; floating, bioluminescent globes that could be neurons in a vast brain; and other, stranger things. There are strange smells and sounds. People often experience telepathic static, hearing thoughts of people around them or having flashes of alien imagery. Areas infested by the daelkyr may use any of the traps found in the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}, but in this realm, hazards are generally {@i alive}. A falling net is a web-like membrane secreted by the ceiling. Poison darts are chitinous stingers grown by the walls. These traps can still be evaded by the standard methods, though at the DM's discretion, unusual skills could also apply; perhaps an organic poison needle trap could be disarmed with a Dexterity ({@skill Medicine}) check instead of using thieves' tools.",
												"Dyrrn's specialty is corruption, both mental and physical. Thus it has created creatures like the dolgrims and dolgaunts--goblinoids physically transformed into monsters, the most prolific denizens of the dark--as well as the derro, who still bear some resemblance to the dwarves they once were, but whose minds have been altered.",
												"Dolgaunts often command units of dolgrims, but dolgaunts can also be found acting alone or maintaining strange shrines. The statistics presented in {@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW} represent the typical creature, but unique dols can have greater abilities. Dols are capable of acting with surprising discipline and precision, but their strategies are often unorthodox and enigmatic.",
												"Derro aren't aberrations, but are believed to be dwarves twisted by Dyrrn's power. There may be derro whose roots go back to the ancient dwarves who built Sol Udar; however, the common assumption is that the derro are the descendants of the lost dwarves of Noldrunhold. Other derro could be more recent victims, created from Mror settlers captured in the Dol Udar. The derro are nomadic scavengers who remain in constant motion, roaming the deep tunnels of the Realm Below. They completely ignore Dyrrn's aberrations, and seem to be ignored in turn; one scout reported seeing a derro band walk through a dolgrim camp, without acknowledgment from either side. Some scholars believe that the derro can't perceive the aberrations, and that some believe themselves to be in a reality in which Sol Udar is still in its time of glory, and the derro are its lords. They don't appear to serve Dyrrn directly, but they definitely see all outsiders from above as enemies. A derro warlord calling himself Lord Mror has repeatedly attacked Mror colonies; however, it's unclear if this is a single powerful derro with followers across the realm, or if several derro savants use this title.",
												"The daelkyr often hold the most important areas of an Udar site; as such, these dungeons contain both treasures created by the dwarves and the organic tools of the daelkyr. However, the purpose of areas claimed by Dyrrn's forces varies widely. In some cases, there's a clear logic to what these creatures are doing: dolgrims could have seized an ancient foundry and begun forging weapons. Explorers could find some sort of spawning pit where new aberrations are being produced. But the behavior of aberrations is often alien and inexplicable; a chamber could contain a giant, beating heart that serves no apparent purpose, or a pool of liquid that reflects another location. The inhabitants of the depths are unpredictable, and aberrations may not have the same biological needs as natural humanoids; for example, dolgrims don't need to work subterranean farms for food.",
												"Some aberrations are permanently settled in a region, but others may spill out of portals to Dyrrn's domain, and others may be grown on the spot by the organic matter spread throughout infested regions, or created from the corpses of foolish explorers. A gibbering mouther may whisper with the voices of the dwarves who ventured into the depths last week.",
												"While mind flayers can be found serving any daelkyr, Dyrrn the Corruptor is their creator. Sol Udar is thus a logical place to encounter mind flayers or any creatures associated with them: intellect devourers, ulitharids, neothelids, and the like. Bear in mind that these creatures may serve a very different role in Eberron than in other settings, as they are the creations of Dyrrn; a neothelid may be an intentional creation, as opposed to an accidental abomination. Elder brains are tools used as telepathic anchors, linking local mind flayers, while the elder brains are linked to Dyrrn itself. In general, mind flayers serve as Dyrrn's emissaries and lieutenants--directing lesser aberrations or humanoid cults, or engaged in inscrutable research. The most infamous mind flayer is Dyrrashar, the ulitharid who delivered Dyrrn's Promise. It has appeared multiple times since then, often leading subtle attacks against Udar colonies.",
												"Most other threats are encountered in isolation, and almost any sort of aberration could be found in the darkness; you can also use unusual variations of aberrations or monstrosities, shifting the creature to fit your story. For example, beholders primarily serve Belashyrra, the Lord of Eyes, but Dyrrn could have beholder servitors with beaks surrounded with tentacles, as opposed to toothy maws."

										"The first Mror dwarves to explore Sol Udar were amazed at the treasures they found. While there was no sign of the original inhabitants, their possessions remained. Early explorers found remarkable jewelry, intriguing artwork, and caskets of coins--but magic items were often the most valuable. Many of these are like those found in the Five Nations, with a focus on practicality--items such as the {@item alchemy jug}, {@item bag of holding}, or {@item decanter of endless water}. While similar items are produced in the Five Nations, the arcane techniques used are intriguing, and some items displayed superior qualities; one team of scouts found an alchemy keg that's bulkier than the standard jug, but can produce twice the amount of liquid each day--and the alcohol it produces is far more potent than that of a standard {@item alchemy jug}. The {@table Sol Udar Trinkets|ExploringEberron} table presents some interesting items, both magical and mundane, that might be found adventuring in the Realm Below.",
										"Beyond the minor curiosities scattered throughout Sol Udar, there were far greater treasures--legendary magic items and artifacts, things that can't be created in the present day. Only a few of these wonders have been found, and these have become a source of immense pride for the clans that possess them. It's common for a clan to declare such items to be the work of their ancestors, though this is typically a talespinner's fancy. Little concrete scholarship has been done on most of these treasures, and despite the commonly accepted myth of the dwarven exile, there's no reason to think that the ancestors of the modern Mror were all distributed evenly around the mountains, their descendants just happening to have remained exactly above their ancestral homes. Nonetheless, these relics are seen as proof of the power and potential of a clan, and most clan leaders don't look kindly on outsiders questioning their stories. Surely even more powerful and precious artifacts remain to be found in the deeper layers of the Realm Below, but the Dol Udar has kept the Mror from claiming these wonders.",
										"While battling aberrations and making expeditions into infested layers, the dwarves recovered another unusual treasure--symbionts, living tools crafted by the daelkyr. Chapter 7 presents eight new symbionts that might be found in the Realm Below. Many clans want nothing to do with these foul things; Doldarun dwarves always burn symbionts with the corpses of the creatures that carry them. But not all dwarves share this distaste. Some clans see symbionts as just another form of treasure from the depths. The Toldorath and Droranath dwarves have no fear of symbionts, and a warrior may carry a {@i hungry axe} (as described in chapter 7) without protest from their clan; but these clans haven't embraced symbionts beyond keeping the trophies taken from fallen enemies. Both Soldorak and Narathun have gone further; in addition to using salvaged symbionts, these clans have spent decades studying the science behind these items and creating their own symbionts. In some cases, they are replicating existing items, but Soldorak fleshcrafters have also created unique symbionts, integrating the principles of daelkyr magic with their own arcane traditions. Those clans that favor such tools call fleshcrafted items {@i dolaur}--spoils of war. On the other hand, those that despise them often call symbionts and those who use them {@i dularash}--foul blood--a term often used to refer to spoiled meat or corrupted bloodlines.",
										"Many existing magic items can be reflavored as symbionts. A Soldorak artificer might create a {@item cloak of elvenkind}, but formed of leathery, living flesh that shifts in hue like a chameleon. A Narathun {@item rope of climbing} isn't rope at all, but a coiled tentacle that follows the commands of the creature holding it. The Soldorak have created {@i lighting bugs}--identical in function to {@item everbright lantern|erlw|everbright lanterns}, but able to cling or detach to a surface on command. These bugs need to be fed a few drops of blood each day, and in communities that use these, the former lamplighters now walk the streets to feed the bugs from their own body.",
										"Outsiders may be horrified by these living tools, but the motives of dwarves that use them are rational to many of their people. To many Mror, these items are trophies, concrete proof of Mror victories over the daelkyr: \"If you took a magic axe from a fallen foe, you'd be a fool to throw it away. So what if it moans when it kills? It's a powerful weapon, and it's mine by right of conquest!\" Many Mror also see carrying these tools as a sign of their courage, proudly demonstrating they aren't afraid to put on living armor. They may bask in the fear that their treasures instill in their enemies. In addition, both Soldorak and Narathun are ambitious clans, and leaders hope that by unlocking the secrets of fleshcrafting, they can increase the power of their clans.",
										"Those clans that revile symbionts say that fleshcrafting is an abomination and an affront to Aureon and Onatar. The Narathun counter that Onatar is the master artisan and can work with any material; it is the doubters who insult Onatar by thinking his servants can't master this new medium. This argument has found supporters in Clan Soranath; while the Soranath dwarves don't fully embrace symbionts as the Soldorak and Narathun do, they are interested in the science of fleshcrafting and have been studying these techniques.",
										"The clans that embrace these techniques say that there is no danger, that this is just another form of science, while Doldarun dwarves insist that there can be no traffic with the daelkyr without corruption. The DM will have to decide the truth--can Soldorak benefit from their exploration of fleshcrafting, or are their warlocks and artificers being corrupted by Dyrrn? Whatever the truth of it, tensions between those clans who embrace these tools and those who revile them continue to rise.",
										"A character exploring the fleshcrafting techniques could be an artificer, describing their spellcasting as being tied to organic tools. Other arcane scholars who explore the techniques of the daelkyr become warlocks, typically using the Great Old One as their patron. In creating a Mror warlock, consider whether you're bargaining with Dyrrn itself--are you a cultist of the Dragon Below, willing to serve the daelkyr to gain power? Or have you gained your powers from studying the daelkyr and their methods, but instead of serving them, you're essentially stealing their techniques and hacking their systems? If you follow the latter path, you might not have a literal patron at all, or your \"patron\" could be a cabal of other dwarves studying the same techniques, and their requests help all of you learn more about fleshcrafting. Or if your DM is willing, perhaps you can even tap into the telepathic network of Dyrrn and the elder brains to steal their secrets; rather than receiving requests from your \"patron,\" you gain flashes of insight or information about them--attacks that are going to happen, plans you might stop--that could drive your actions."

It's worth noting that almost all Mror value many of these virtues, but in their stories, one founder is acknowledged as the best at that thing. Clan Doldarun certainly values strength, but in the story, Doldarun's defining feature is his courage and integrity, while Droranath is known for his untamable strength. Likewise, while each clan includes suggestions for possible character classes, any character could come from any clan; in particular, talespinner bards and entertainers are found in every clan.",

In the meantime, Doldarun draws a hard line against trafficking with the daelkyr or any form of fleshcrafting, and any outsider carrying symbionts receives a very hostile reaction in Doldarunhold.

Some Droranath develop the skills of the stealthy hunter, striking down enemies from afar, but most Droranath warriors prefer to look their enemy in the eye and to see their fear. Droranath warriors perfect a technique called {@i tra dolhass}--the battle cry--a wild howl as the warrior charges the enemy, summoning their adrenaline and fury. The Droranath love battle, and for centuries they have sold their services as mercenaries through House Deneith. The \"Mror Howlers\" are valued as shock troops and vanguard warriors.

The Kolkarun shrug and respond, \"Only a fool passes up an opportunity.\" Currently, they have strong ties to Mroranon, which relies on their support in the Iron Council and makes use of Kolkarun as ambassadors and spies, and they have maintained strong ties to Soldorak since the Exile. Many of the most powerful members of the Aurum are Kolkarun dwarves.",
												"Kolkarun dwarves are the most adept sailors of the Mror. While they don't focus their efforts on fishing, they have long been the primary sailors ferrying goods along Mirror Lake and facilitating trade and transit within the holds. However, House Lyrandar produces better ships than the Mror ever did, and today Kolkarun sailors are often licensed by Lyrandar.",
												"Kolkarun was quick to explore the Realm Below before the threat was known, but even they proved unable to negotiate with the horrors of the deep. Kolkarun holds a few outposts in Sol Udar--often with the help of Droranath mercenaries--but hasn't made strong offensive moves in recent decades.",
												"Kolkarun dwarves are among those most likely to travel, and Kolkarun entertainers, sailors, and merchants can be found across Khorvaire. Most of the Iron Council's spies are Kolkarun; the charlatan background works well for both clever merchant and freelance spy. Bard is a reasonable choice for a Kolkarun character, and they're among the few dwarves with a true interest in lore."

												"In the tales of the Exile, Lanarak and Londurak are siblings. Farmers and brewers, they're all but indistinguishable to outsiders, but the two are constantly striving to outdo each other. This mythic pattern remains true today. These holds lie on opposite sides of Mirror Lake, and they're both devoted to farming and fishing; many of the mountain clans rely on these valley clans for sustenance. But despite their deep similarities in outlook and lifestyle, these two clans are constantly feuding. This rarely escalates to violence, instead typically driving them to find ways to perform better than their rivals, though there have been times where one clan has actively sabotaged the other. Despite this, both Lanarak and Londurak proclaim to possess vast common sense--to prefer fishing to fighting, and to always be able to find a simple solution to complex problems. Dwarves from these clans established inns across the holds; these days, most of these inns have been bought up or licensed by House Ghallanda, but there's a decent chance that if a bartender's a dwarf, they're from one of these two clans.",
												"While Lanarak and Londurak don't mine metals, both traditionally farm mushrooms and red pudding in deep caverns, and both were drawn into the War Below. Londurak quickly pulled out of the war; they have sealed all passages and forbidden anyone from venturing into Sol Udar. Lanarak still tends its gardens on the upper levels. This has given Lanarak an edge over its rivals, especially as traditional Mror spirits are made with mushrooms. However, Lanarak has also suffered several significant supernatural attacks over the last few decades--outbreaks of the Frenzy and similar threats. It's rare for dwarves from these valley clans to take risks or to leave the holds, but a remarkable folk hero or sailor could hear the call of adventure."

The mythical Mroranon is said to have been the son of the last king of the Realm Below, and to have rallied the exiles to establish the Mror Holds. Talespinners say that it was Kol Korran's bargain with Mroranon that ensured prosperity for the dwarves, and Krona Peak is home to both the Iron Council and Kol Korran's Throne, the largest temple dedicated to the Sovereign in Khorvaire.",
												"While Mroranonhold has a wide variety of mines, it's best known for iron and mithral. It has established strong ties with House Cannith, though all of the Five Nations import Mroranon steel. It has the strongest general industrial base of the holds, and Krona Peak is the largest single city in the region.",
												"Mroranon dwarves are proud of their skills as warriors and negotiators, even if they acknowledge Doldarun and Kolkarun to be the best in those fields. What sets the Mroranon apart is leadership. Mroranon sees the future and inspires others to follow. Mroranon unites, and makes wise decisions for the good of all. This ties to the mythic story of Mroranon as the leader--Doldarun is a mighty champion, but Mroranon has the vision. Mroranon are strong supporters of the Sovereign Host and believe that the dwarves are blessed; many of the most devout Mror priests and powerful adepts hail from Mroranonhold.",
												"With the largest and most industrialized territory, Mroranon has the deepest investment in the Realm Below. It has multiple colony outposts, including one tied to a demiplane mine and another holding an ancient fortress, and is holding a firm line while building power for another surge. Mroranon and its vassal clans have recovered many legendary relics and artifacts from the depths. While they don't oppose symbionts as strongly as Doldarun, they refuse to make use of dularash items and assert that any contact with the daelkyr or their creations is dangerous.",
												"Acolyte, noble, and soldier are common backgrounds for Mroranon dwarves. While paladins are more likely to be found in Doldarun, clerics (especially Knowledge, Trickery, or Life), fighters, and bards are all sound choices for Mroranon. With its big cities, it's also a reasonable option for criminals and rogues."

												"Narathun is a small clan, but has always had power. The mythic hero Narathun was the lone wizard of the exiles, and their people hoarded this knowledge. Narathun was renowned for its magewrights, especially its oracles; while they draw rubies and sapphires from their mines and produce beautiful jewelry, secrets have always been one of Narathunhold's primary exports. Narathun dwarves appreciate tragedy and sacrifices. The clan is known for its artists and its bards; its work is unquestionably beautiful, but certainly more morbid than that of other clans; it's no accident that its largest city is called Shadowspire.",
												"In the modern age, the dragonmarked houses and traditions of Galifar have brought magewrights to all holds. But its oracles are still respected, and the Ebon Library of Shadowspire is the one of the finest schools of divination in Khorvaire. Narathun sages have always asserted that no knowledge should be forbidden, and Shadowspire holds temples both to the Shadow and to the Blood of Vol. Clan Narathun is fascinated by the Realm Below, though it lacks the forces to push as deeply into Sol Udar as it would like, and Narathun patrons might well employ adventurers willing to risk their lives in the depths. Narathun artificers have embraced the study of fleshcrafting; while they are no match for Mordain the Fleshweaver, they have made remarkable developments over the past few decades.",
												"Narathun dwarves hold long grudges. They have never forgiven Tordannon and Toldorath for thefts that occurred before Bal Dulor, and despise Droranath for a murder that occurred eight centuries ago. Doldarun has long condemned Narathun for its \"foul practices,\" and its pursuit of fleshcrafting has exacerbated this. However, the other clans value its jewels and its knowledge, and others have always stood in between Narathun and Doldarun. Soldorak and Narathun are staunch allies, reinforced by their interest in the Realm Below.",
												"A character from Narathun lends itself more to introspection than interaction and bargaining, and Narathun dwarves are more likely to be artificers or wizards than warlocks. Narathun entertainers and bards produce haunting works; the College of Whispers is an appropriate choice. This is also an excellent clan for hermits, acolytes, or clerics tied to the Dark Six or the Blood of Vol. Despite the propaganda spread by Clan Doldarun, Narathun dwarves are no more likely to be evil than any others."

												"In Dwarven, {@i sol dorak} means \"defender of the realm.\" While most Mror legends present the legendary Lord Mror as a wise and powerful leader, the talespinners of Solangap say that Lord Mror was an iron-handed tyrant--that the hero Soldorak challenged Mror for the good of the common people, and it was this that led to the Exile. In all of the stories, Soldorak supports underdogs and challenges outdated systems and oppressive authority. In some ways, this is at odds with the fact that Soldorak remains part of the feudal system that has defined the holds for a thousand years. However, Soldorak is more flexible than the other clans. Tenant families have a path to become freeholders, and much like the Aereni, Soldorak seeks to draw the most talented dwarves from all walks of life into the ruling clan. However, this is a knife that cuts both ways; people can also be expelled from the ruling clan, and heirs are expected to constantly prove their worth and cunning, not to simply rest on the power of their name.",
												"This principle is the cornerstone of the Soldorak character. \"Power must be earned. The ends justify the means.\" They believe the common concept of \"honor\" is a trick that serves those in power; true honor lies in using your wits to defeat impossible odds. It was this principle that led clan nobles to found the Aurum, originally as a nexus for acts of rebellion against Galifar; today it continues to counterbalance the influence of foreign aristocrats and dragonmarked houses.",
												"Soldorak is one of the most populous holds, and one of the richest. Its fortune lies in all manner of precious metals, especially platinum and gold; coins from the Soldorak Mint circulate across Khorvaire, and Soldorak has many foreign investments. It has invested deeply in the Realm Below and is second only to Clan Mroranon in its subterranean holdings. However, Soldorak has embraced the use of {@i dolaur}--symbionts--and continues to explore the alien powers of the daelkyr even while it recovers dwarf artifacts. Soldorak has also embraced the path of the warlock. These dwarves have less patience for arcane study than their allies in Narathun, and are less likely to become artificers or wizards. But bargaining for power, earning supernatural gifts with your wits and will? That's the Soldorak way. Soldorak maintains that this tradition is entirely safe--that Sol warlocks can tap the power of the daelkyr without serving them--but Doldarun is certain that all Soldorak dwarves are corrupt, and Mroranon sees this foul practice as another way to discredit its rivals.",
												"While it's home to nobles and soldiers, Soldorakhold also has more than its fair share of charlatans and criminals. It's a haven for all manner of rogues and warlocks, especially Great Old One warlocks manipulating the powers of the daelkyr. While outsiders view the Soldorak as evil, they are primarily about challenging tradition and refusing to accept unearned authority; a Soldorak folk hero could champion underdogs anywhere in Khorvaire. Soldorak dwarves are typically skeptical of organized religion; there are relatively few temples in the region, and clerics and acolytes are uncommon."

												"Not all artisans are from Soranath, just as not all of the denizens of Soranathhold are artisans. Most blades in Mroranonhold are forged by Mroranon smiths. But Soranath artisans are unmatched in their techniques and their work ethic. Rather than being bound by secrets of the past, Soranath smiths are always looking for ways to improve their techniques, searching for new sources of inspiration. While this sounds impressive, Soranath is a small hold with limited resources, without the capabilities either in research or production of House Cannith or the Arcane Congress. The artisans of Clan Soranath won't change the world with their works, but they produce remarkable things for those who can afford it.",
												"Soranathhold is small, with only three spires. Its families are tightly knit, and the divide between tenant and clan is a thin line. Industry is the prime virtue of Soranath, and its people work hard and live austere lives; for Soranath dwarves, a job done well is more satisfying than any luxury. Soranath has abundant deposits of dragonshard geodes, and thus isn't dependent on Tharashk, but doesn't seek to challenge Tharashk as an exporter of shards. Due to its otherwise limited resources, Soranath is dependent on other clans for many things, including protection. Soranath artificers are fascinated by the potential of the Realm Below and what they could learn both from the Udar artifacts and the symbionts of the daelkyr, and Grayroot Spire has been experimenting with fleshcrafting. However, they are artisans, not warriors; they must hire others to venture into Sol Udar on their behalf.",
												"The Soranath dwarves are devoted to the Sovereign Host, especially to Onatar; they are quick to assign credit for any great work to the Sovereign of Fire and Forge. There may also be a cult of the Traveler within Soranath, perhaps in Grayroot Spire; if so, it keeps its true devotion well hidden.",
												"Soranath dwarves are generally guild artisans, acolytes, or sages. Artificers (primarily Battle Smiths) and clerics of the Forge are both logical classes for Soranath dwarves."

												"Like Lanarak and Londurak, the mythic founders of Clans Toldorath and Tordannon were siblings. Unlike their fellow exiles, Toldorath and Tordannon never quarreled. They followed the same path, shared the same labors, and even built their holds adjacent to one another; the city of Frosthaven lies directly between the two holds and serves as the capital for both.",
												"Toldorath and Tordannon had many skills, though they were masters of few. They were hunters and herders, warriors and miners. But above all, they were the most gifted healers of the exiles, ready to help anyone in need. Before Bal Dolur, Frosthaven healers were found across the holds. This changed with the arrival of House Jorasco. Today the finest healers in the Mror Holds are halflings, but dwarves still serve in the healing houses. More importantly, the farms of Toldorath and Tordannon are a primary source of many medicinal herbs and flowers that drive Jorasco operations across Khorvaire.",
												"At a glance, Toldorath and Tordannon have much in common. They mine copper and herd mountain tribex and other beasts on the fields surrounding Mirror Lake. They're stoic warriors when they must fight, but they never start a quarrel unless driven to it. In other ways, they are quite different. Tordannon dwarves are devoted to the Sovereign Host, while the Toldorath are ambivalent about religion. Tordannon suffered grievous losses in the War Below; they shun symbionts, have sealed off their deep passages, and live in fear of the next assault. In contrast, the Toldorath are intrigued by symbionts and keen to delve deeper into Sol Udar. Despite these differences, they support one another. Loyalty is one of the prime virtues of these clans--to family, clan, and the holds themselves.",
												"But there is one thing that makes these two Frosthaven clans stand out: their support for the Jhorash'tar orcs. A story says an orc shaman taught the healing arts to Toldorath and Tordannon in the first days of the Exile. This could be pure fantasy--the modern Jhorash'tar aren't particularly adept healers--but regardless, these two clans have always sought peace between orc and dwarf. This has brought them into bitter conflict with Clan Droranath. There have also been times when the Frosthaven clans have themselves suffered at the hands of the orcs, when a tribe has struck a Tordannon spire in retaliation for perceived treachery. But the clan lords remain committed to building a bridge between the two peoples. Over the last century, they have promoted the concept of giving the orcs a seat on the Iron Council. Toldorath has employed Jhorash'tar mercenaries to help secure its colony in the Realm Below, and is seeking to expand this force to drive a new offensive.",
												"Toldorath and Tordannon have no specialty that calls out a specific style of adventurer, but this just means that any character could come from Frosthaven. They have soldiers and fighters, hunters and rangers. What drives these clans is loyalty and kindness, their belief that it's always better to make a new friend than to dismiss someone as an enemy."

While House Sivis estimates that Kundarak's dragonmark appeared less than three thousand years ago, in the stories, Kundarak had always borne the mark and used its powers to protect their people. Dwarves of all clans relied on Kundarak, both for wise counsel and their expertise in building. Kundarak laid the foundations of the fortresses that stood against the armies of Galifar.",
												"But soon after Bal Dulor, Clan Kundarak became House Kundarak, expanding its influence across Khorvaire. While they held onto their ancestral lands, the Korth Edicts required Kundarak to sever its ties to the other clans, putting the interests of its clients ahead of those of the Mror. While this caused initial tension, it also brought an influx of gold and influence, and served as a bridge between the holds and the outside world. Kundarak helped bring dragonmarked services to the Mror Holds, and also helped build connections between houses and clans--House Deneith and the Droranath, House Jorasco and the Frosthaven clans. So while there was some estrangement, the clans generally accepted Kundarak's new role--though Soldorak has long decried Kundarak as abandoning traditional values and selling out the dwarves.",
												"House Kundarak has no seat on the Iron Council and is not considered a Mror clan. Kundarak has done its best to stay out of the War Below, though Kundarak engineers played an important part in building defenses during the War Below, and were well paid for their services.

Noldrun was clever and curious, an explorer who was always finding new things. Noldrunhold was never a large clan, but its greatest mine--Korran's Maw--was a rich source for a seemingly impossible array of minerals, including Eberron and Khyber dragonshards. This made it a strong ally of House Kundarak and Zilargo, and brought tremendous wealth to the clan.",
												"And then, approximately four hundred years ago, Noldrunhold fell silent. Messengers sent into the hold never returned. Noldrun had previously fought many fierce battles with the Jhorash'tar, and blame immediately fell to the orcs; but none could explain how the Jhorash'tar could have achieved such a massacre.",
												"The fate of Noldrunhold remains a mystery to this day. Most contemporary records of what explorers found were passed down orally and are unreliable. In some accounts, corpses were skinned; in others, there were no corpses, as if the Noldrun had all simply vanished. Some suggest that the Noldrun all gathered together and descended into Korran's Maw; others say the Jhorash'tar killed them and threw the bodies into the Maw. Neighboring clans Soldorak and Droranath both sought to expand into the abandoned territory and claim the empty spires, but all attempts were abandoned--again, the stories of why are unreliable. Some say the new settlers killed each other in an irrational frenzy, others say they simply disappeared. The Droranath blame the Jhorash'tar orcs, and mysteriously, there are tribes of Jhorash'tar still living on old Noldrun lands, though even they shun the empty cities and Korran's Maw.",
												"Today, many assume that the Noldrun must have been the first victims of the War Below--that they dug too deep and were destroyed by Dyrrn. Some assume the derro found in Sol Udar are the remnants of the Noldrun dwarves. But that's all just conjecture. Perhaps it was the work of a fiendish overlord imprisoned in the region. Perhaps it was an early impact of whatever caused the Mourning, or some sort of Cannith experiment. Or perhaps it was the Jhorash'tar after all, and the orcs possess some hidden power they have yet to reveal."

The Jhorash'tar have no written records, but their tales suggest they once held most of the Ironroots, and that many of their tribes were annihilated in the early days of the Exile. However, others suggest that the orcs might have been eradicated by the civilization that built Sol Udar. Indeed, the existence of the Face of Mror--a mountain sculpted to resemble a dwarf king, a feat of engineering far beyond the capabilities of the modern Mror--implies the dwarves of Sol Udar were active on the surface of the mountains at some point. Whatever the truth, by the time of Bal Dulor, the bulk of the Jhorash'tar had been pushed to the southwestern regions of the Ironroot Mountains, where they continued to clash with Clan Droranath and Clan Noldrun.",
												"The Jhorash'tar orcs have a distinct culture, with nothing in common with the Ghaash'kala orcs of the Demon Wastes or the Gatekeepers of the Shadow Marches. There are at least six distinct tribes, each split into smaller bands; the DM can add details to a particular tribe to suit the story. Some dwell on the surface of the mountains--often in caves along canyon walls--while others dwell underground, in the same layer the dwarves mined for centuries before breaking through into Sol Udar. The Jhorash'tar have never formed large communities, and usually split when a band has a hundred or more adult members, or whenever a bonecaster--their spiritual leader--advises it.",
												"The primary spiritual tradition of the Jhorash'tar is called the Path of Bones. Bonecasters are their priests and diviners. They can speak with the dead and temporarily conjure spirits to produce magical effects, but traditionally they don't create lasting undead. A player character following this path might be a cleric with the Grave domain, though the typical bonecaster doesn't have access to all the spells and features of a cleric. Bonesworn are elite champions strengthened by spirits; a player character following this path could be an Ancestral Guardian or Zealot barbarian. The Jhorash'tar believe that the ghosts of the fallen linger, and continue to guide the living through whispers and dreams. Tribes often decorate the entrances of their dwellings with the bones of their own fallen warriors, believing that the spirits of the fallen protect them.",
												"The Jhorash'tar don't work metal, though some are willing to use metal weapons and armor acquired from the Mror. Bonecaster rituals allow them to shape and harden bone, and they often incorporate bones in weapons and armor. While they often use the bones of large creatures, it's also common for one of the bonesworn to carry a weapon or token that incorporates an ancestor's bone. The Jhorash'tar also work with other natural materials, including wood and stone. They have no equivalent to heavy armor, but can combine bone and leather to create armor that offers similar protection to a breastplate or scale mail.",
												"Many of the Jhorash'tar tribes wish for peace with the dwarves, and are working with the Frosthaven clans to reach an understanding. For the most part, these tribes don't want to live alongside Mror in their cities, but wish for their own recognized lands, and want the right to gather the bones of other orcs from across the holds. However, there are also tribes hungry for vengeance, driven by the cries of their fallen. Such tribes continue to engage in guerilla war and to spread terror however they can. As far as the Mror know, the orcs have had no contact with the Realm Below or the forces of Dyrrn--but it's possible that a tribe has been touched by the Corruptor, and could emerge with unusual powers or even allied with aberrations.",
												"It's up to the DM whether the Jhorash'tar were involved in the destruction of Noldrunhold. Whatever the truth, Jhorash'tar tribes live safely in Noldrun territory, though they shun its cities."

Most major port cities--including Sharn and Stormreach--host representatives of nearby aquatic nations, and envoys on the docks can help plan and authorize travel through their domains. As a result, most sailors know at least a little about the cultures of the waters they pass through, and every Lyrandar crew includes a \"sea speaker\" who knows Sahuagin and Aquan.",

As dangerous as these waters are, this is a crucial crossroads for trade, and there's a constant stream of ships flowing between Sharn, Stormreach, and Pylas Talaer. It's here that the sahuagin first arose, the seat of their greatest civilization.",

This overlord embodies the fear of the unknown, of the evil that could be lurking just beyond sight, and the fear that our friends could be secretly scheming against us. The Lurker created the aboleths, who conquered and dominated creatures of the deep--giants, dragons, and sahuagin. The struggle against the overlords played out beneath the water just as it did above. Dragons battled krakens and giants fought aboleths, while the sahuagin consumed the fallen on both sides. The wrath of the Lurker shattered the ocean floor. Dragons were impaled on spires of demonglass. But in time, the overlords were bound and the aboleths fled into the deepest abysses.",

Their permanent settlements are tied to manifest zones, and they perform rituals to contain the threat posed by these zones. The other major power in the Thunder Sea is the Valraean Protectorate, the domain of the sea elves. These elves laid claim to the waters around Aerenal, conquering the local sahuagin and other species, and bending them to their will. The Dominion sahuagin despise the Valraean elves, but thus far, the power of the Undying Court has repelled every assault.",

In addition to the ships of House Lyrandar (both elemental galleons with dragonmarked captains and mundane ships licensed by the house), the Thunder Sea sees traffic from Aerenal, Zilargo, Breland, and Riedra. The most important ports include Pylas Maradal (Valenar), Pylas Talaer (Aerenal), Sharn (Breland), Stormreach (Xen'drik), Trolanport (Zilargo), Wyvernskull (Darguun), and Zarash'ak (Shadow Marches).",
												"These major ports see both commercial, diplomatic, and military traffic. Aereni merchants carry shipments of exotic lumber, Riedran vessels are laden with crysteel and dragonshards, Lyrandar ships carry all manner of trade goods, and smugglers sneak barrels of kuryeva and tilxin blood into hidden coves. While the standard map of Khorvaire focuses on these major ports, there are also countless smaller ports and fishing villages scattered along the coastline.",
												"The masters of the Thunder Sea--the sahuagin--don't want dryskins blundering through their territory. Traveling directly along the coastline is reasonably safe, and local fisherfolk don't need to negotiate with sahuagin every time they set sail; the sahuagin don't lay claim to the waters within 6 miles of Khorvaire's coast, and permit fishing an additional 20 miles beyond that. But crossing the Thunder Sea is an entirely different story. Setting aside the territorial claims of the sahuagin, the sea is filled with deadly hazards--endless storms, demonglass spires, and hungry monstrosities.",

Captains who wish to use these routes must obtain {@i beacons of passage}--common magic items that tell the sahuagin their travel is authorized, charged to last for a set time. Even with a {@i beacon}, there are places--such as Shargon's Teeth--where a wise captain pays for the services of a sahuagin or merfolk guide.",
												"Some brave (or foolish) souls deviate from these approved routes, whether desiring speed or avoiding the cost of local customs and the price of a {@i beacon}. The Thunder Sea is nearly the size of Khorvaire itself, and the sahuagin aren't everywhere; however, those regions shunned by the sahuagin and merfolk are usually avoided with good reason, and smugglers may face dangerous environmental hazards or hungry monstrosities."

At the same time, it can seem as though things aren't limited enough. Shouldn't something strange happen when you generate lightning damage underwater?

Beyond wind and rain, tales speak of maelstroms that drag down even the largest vessels and masses of vegetation that rise from the water to entangle ships. All of these are very real threats, even more so because these dangers don't obey simple laws of wind and water. The Thunder Sea is home to a wide range of manifest zones, but the most powerful and numerous are those tied to Lamannia. The endless fury of the First Storm lashes ships with lightning and storm winds, and great maelstroms can pull a ship down into the Endless Ocean. The vast masses of vegetation are tied to the Twilight Forest, fueling unnatural growth that can latch onto a vessel and trap it in the sargassum. Though the influence of Lamannia is most strongly felt here, it's also possible to find an unexpected region of icebergs surrounding a manifest zone tied to Risia, boiling waters around a Fernian zone, or a region tied to Mabar where the shadows of sailors turn on the living.",
												"As any skilled ocean navigator can tell you, manifest zones are stable, physical locations. While a manifest zone's influence extends beyond its focal point, the worst storms of the Thunder Sea remain confined to specific areas. However, when the plane linked to a manifest zone is coterminous, its impact is dramatically enhanced, with storms extending beyond their usual radius and becoming far more powerful. This is why knowledge of the sea is vitally important for sailors; if you venture off the approved trade routes, you need to chart a course that will avoid the storms.",
												"Lamannian manifest zones often release elementals into Eberron. An eternal storm may contain air elementals, while water elementals can be found in the region around a maelstrom. Such elementals aren't intentionally cruel, but they're driven to express their elemental drives--which often makes them dangerous to ships, which they perceive as alien invaders. Manifest zones can also produce dire beasts--octopi, sharks, and other creatures of remarkable size.",
												"The merfolk of the Thunder Sea (discussed in more detail later in this section) serve as planar shepherds, tending manifest zones and helping to contain and mitigate their effects. This isn't absolute; the merfolk can't entirely disperse the power of the First Storm, or stop the growth of the Twilight Forest. But they seek to direct it, choosing to vent its power at times when there is minimal danger to innocents. Even when a region has especially bad storms due to a manifest zone, those storms could be far, far worse if the merfolk stopped performing their rituals or were driven away entirely."

These demonglass spires--commonly called \"needle teeth\"--can pierce the hull of a swiftly moving ship despite being just a few inches in width. The spires in this region were created by the Lurker in Shadow during the First War (though it wasn't responsible for the demonglass found elsewhere in Eberron, such as Ashtakala in the Demon Wastes).",

Stone spires and demonglass spikes of all sizes are scattered between this chain of islands. Only the most seasoned navigators can plot a course through the Teeth without the help of a sahuagin guide; as a result, the islands have long been a haven for smugglers and pirates, preying on ships that founder on the Teeth.",

Any number of aquatic monstrosities may make a lair in the upper reaches of a spire. The sahuagin also often colonize the larger teeth, carving tunnels throughout a spire. High teeth thus serve as outposts projecting up to the upper waters where light can reach, allowing travelers to visit a sahuagin outpost without having to descend to the absolute depths."

They've slept since the beginning of recorded history, and are immune to all forms of divination magic. They could be creations of Khyber trapped before they could rise to the surface, or they could've been crafted by Eberron to guard against some future threat. Perhaps they are young progenitors, and when they finally wake, they will create new worlds.",
												"All that's known for certain is that the kar'lassa are massive, immortal monstrosities... and that each is bound to one of the planes. Each kar'lassa radiates the effects of a powerful manifest zone, extending up to 13 miles. The appearance of each kar'lassa reflects the plane they're tied to; the kar'lassa of Shavarath is a massive draconic beast with steel scales, while the kar'lassa of Fernia is a serpent of embers, water forever boiling against its skin. But the strangest aspect of the kar'lassa is their dreams. As described in chapter 5, when mortals dream, their spirits are usually drawn into Dal Quor. However, when the kar'lassa dream, {@i they don't dream in Dal Quor}. Instead, each kar'lassa dreams in the plane it's tied to--and more wondrous yet, each great dreamer draws in the spirits of dreaming mortals. Any creature that dreams within 13 miles of a kar'lassa--including unwary sailors passing above, if any are bold enough to go off the approved travel routes--is pulled into the behemoth's dream, instead of dreaming in Dal Quor. So, for example, anyone who sleeps in the Dominion city of Hal'iri dreams their dreams in Irian. While dreaming in this way, a creature is only present as a spirit, and is immune to the negative environmental effects of that plane; so a mortal dreamer isn't hurt by the extreme heat of Fernia or the cold of Risia. Even if a dreamer dies in their dream from other causes, they just wake up. This is still {@i dreaming}; unless the dreamer is capable of lucid dreaming, they have little control of their actions and will likely only remember fragments of the experience. But if they do have tools or training that allow lucid dreaming (as with the {@i uul'kur} in chapter 7), this can be an interesting way to explore the planes.",

These ancient primordial forces trump the work of Jhazaal Dhakaan, and the dar are pulled into the dream of the kar'lassa instead of to Dal Quor.

Though the Protectorate hasn't yet captured any Dominion cities, they take great pride in their belief that because they don't sleep, they would be above the influence of the kar'lassa--but this belief is wrong! It's true that elves trance rather than sleep, entering a deep meditative state much like a lucid dream, self-directed and untouched by the influence of either Dal Quor or a kalashtar's quori spirit. However, this process is physiologically similar to a human's dreams and can likewise be hijacked by the kar'lassa--which would be a startling experience for an elf who's never dreamed before!"

The sahuagin harvest biomatter from the kar'lassa, and these substances are the fuel that drives their industry.",

Spells such as {@spell flesh to stone} or {@spell disintegrate} only work on a tiny sliver of the kar'lassa, and even that's quickly restored. If one of these ancient slumbering monstrosities were to rise, it would be an almost unstoppable force of destruction, and destroy the Dominion city in the process. If one of these vast creatures emerged onto land, it could easily devastate cities without even meaning to.",

And indeed, a simple way to introduce the tarrasque into Eberron is to present it as a kar'lassa rising from its slumber and threatening Sharn or Stormreach; just add the effects of a manifest zone to the region around it. The tarrasque is small for a kar'lassa; most are miles long, large enough that the sahuagin build cities around them. But it's possible a small kar'lassa might be the first to wake--can the heroes who oppose it find a way to return it to its slumber before the others wake? If a DM chooses to explore this plotline, they'll have to decide the truth about the origins of the kar'lassa. If they're the children of Eberron, they might not want to destroy innocent creatures; they could have an important purpose as yet unfulfilled. On the other hand, if they're tools of the overlords or the Devourer, their rising will spell disaster."

Once the fiends were defeated, the Sovereigns were determined to take their place and rule as tyrants. The sahuagin Sha'argon was a bold hunter and mighty warrior. He stalked the Sovereigns of the natural world, Arra'ai and Ba'alor. Sha'argon trapped them and consumed them, claiming their power as his own.

Eating a locathah servant can either be an act of punishment or a great honor, depending on how the meal is prepared and consumed. Like the gnolls of the Znir Pact, it's common for a sahuagin to eat at least part of a fallen enemy, though this is more to seal the victory than to honor the spirit; you haven't truly defeated someone until you've consumed them.

This combines with a deep sense of cultural unity; what matters isn't that I defeat the foe, it's that {@i we} defeat it. So while sahuagin frequently compete with other sahuagin, seeking to advance in rank and earn evolution into a higher form, this is about strengthening the Dominion, not simply personal pride. Sahuagin don't seek to cheat their way into positions they believe they don't deserve. Similarly, weakness can't be tolerated, and they spare no time on sentimentality. The sahuagin are children of the Devourer: the point of storm and sickness is to cleanse weakness and strengthen those who survive. Anyone who grows too old or infirm should be challenged by those below them--but this is rare in practice, for a sahuagin who realizes they can no longer perform their role will usually abdicate before they're challenged. It's common practice for a respected retiring leader to be consumed by their subordinates, so their spirit and skills will remain part of the Dominion. The sahuagin warrior who has grown too old to serve has no regrets about being consumed; they lived well, and now they give what strength they have left to nourish those who will come after them. A single life is fleeting; the Dominion is eternal, and your spirit lives on in your comrades who consume you.

Some would also say this limits innovation, and the Dominion is indeed slow to change its methods. Sahuagin are austere in their needs and desires, and don't seek comfort, luxury, or personal wealth. This isn't to say the sahuagin don't enjoy life or seek entertainment--but rather, what drives the sahuagin is victory. They don't care for music or theater, but they enjoy gladiatorial combat and other forms of aggressive sport, such as public debates and arcane duels. They also love to eat, as this is a symbolic victory over whatever they're eating. Symbols of all kinds are important in sahuagin culture. Their armor, weapons, and architecture are designed to intimidate enemies and show off one's rank and status."

												"The eight greatest cities of the Eternal Dominion are built around kar'lassa, each tied to a different plane. The sahuagin harvest biomatter from the slumbering behemoths, and this is the driving fuel of the Eternal Dominion. Pipelines channel the blood of the beasts, and workers dig muscle and bone out of mines carved into their flesh. The eldritch energies sustaining the kar'lassa regenerate damage at a remarkable rate; the Dominion has been harvesting them for over a thousand years, and so far, they haven't come close to taxing these resources.",
												"All biomatter from the kar'lassa is infused with arcane energy, and the sahuagin use these substances in the same way the Five Nations rely on dragonshards. In addition, the biomatter of each kar'lassa has unique properties and potential due to the plane it's tied to. The scales of Hal'shavar can be forged into powerful armor and weapons. The steam-breath of Hal'fer is an extremely powerful catalyst for evocation magic. The blood of Hal'kyth is an exceptional conduit for transmutation. These are just a few examples of the potential of the kar'lassa, and the Dominion itself is still discovering new uses for these resources. The Five Nations have never had an opportunity to work with this biomatter and know nothing of the kar'lassa. If a group of adventurers recovered a significant amount of biomatter--or secured a trade deal with the Dominion--House Cannith could produce strange new wonders.",
												"So the kar'lassa are priceless resources and sources of power for the sahuagin; their biomatter drives Dominion industry, and cities benefit from the effects of their manifest zones. Only eight of the twelve kar'lassa have cities built around them, due to the dangers of the manifest zones extending from the kar'lassa tied to Mabar, Xoriat, Thelanis, and Risia. But even in the cities of the \"safer\" kar'lassa, the sahuagin pay a price for the power they've harnessed. When the people of these cities sleep, their spirits are drawn into the dream of the local kar'lassa--a vast alien dream that takes place in its bound plane, rather than Dal Quor. Most sahuagin aren't lucid dreamers, and don't remember their dreams with any more accuracy than most humans do. But this experience has a notable impact on the personality and aptitudes of the people of each city; the people of Hal'shavar are the most aggressive of the sahuagin, while the people of Hal'syra are the most conciliatory.",
												"The lass'ash--the \"dream priests\"--are an arm of the Ta'har devoted to the kar'lassa of their cities. These priests treat the kar'lassa both as divine beings and as servants; they believe that it's their rituals and devotions that keep the dreamers safely asleep, allowing the Dominion to continue to harvest their biomatter. At the heart of each temple lies the Or'lassa, the First Dreamer--a sahuagin priest sustained by direct infusions of kar'lassa blood. These infusions cause physical mutations that often reflect the shape of the kar'lassa and the plane it is tied to, as well as keep the First Dreamer in a comatose state. Their spirit permanently resides in the kar'lassa dream, where they anchor a temple formed from their pure will. Dream priests are trained in lucid dreaming, and they use these temples as a base both for planar research and to maintain communication across the Dominion. While they reside in different planes, the temples are mystically linked through the kar'lassa, and rituals allow the priests to spiritually travel between the dream-temples, carrying messages to the other cities. And it's in the dream of Hal'iri that the spirits of the Or'lassa meet to coordinate the actions of the Dominion; this is the {@i Sha'lassa}, the Council of Dreams."

												"The Eternal Dominion is an advanced civilization that employs both arcane and divine magic as part of everyday life. It's generally more sophisticated than the Five Nations, but less advanced than Aerenal. Though the Dominion possesses capabilities beyond the Five Nations, its approaches can vary dramatically; for example, while the Dominion could generate {@spell continual flame}, light is largely provided by engineered bioluminescent coral. While the sahuagin employ all schools of magic--generally influenced by the resources of that city's kar'lassa--the Dominion's greatest advances are in alchemy, transmutation, and magebreeding.",
												"The Dominion has an exceptional talent for producing potions, allowing Dominion forces to temporarily boost their capabilities. But their technologies go far beyond temporary alterations, as the Dominion specializes in magebreeding all manner of creatures. The sahuagin themselves are carefully engineered to excel at the tasks chosen for them. In particular, the Dominion creates magewrights and sorcerers. This process isn't quick, taking place over the course of a sahuagin childhood, and including training as well as ongoing rituals and an unusual diet. The blood of the kar'lassa is used as a transformative catalyst, combined with the sahuagin principle, \"If you consume a thing you gain its power.\" As a result, creating a Draconic Bloodline sorcerer requires a young sahuagin to consume the flesh of a dragon--so there's a concrete limit on how many of these sorcerers the sahuagin can create.",
												"In addition to these basic techniques that guide the evolution of a young sahuagin, the Dominion can also induce dramatic secondary mutations; many sahuagin are highly motivated by this prospect of attaining a higher form. The malenti and the four-armed barons are the best known of these, but they represent just a fraction of the Dominion's magebreeding abilities, and the DM can create additional mutants to suit the story. For example, the Claw of Sha'argon (presented in chapter 8) possesses a secondary mutation that's granted to powerful priests. These forms of ascension require rare resources and a significant amount of kar'lassa blood (drawn from a particular dreamer based on the type of transformation sought), and are only granted to sahuagin who prove themselves worthy.",
												"In addition to altering themselves, the sahuagin put many enhanced beasts to good use. Enhanced mantas are a common mount, possessing a swim speed of 90 feet. Mutated giant sharks and eels are used as larger vehicles, sometimes with seating areas formed upon their backs, other times with bony handles protruding from the beast's hide, allowing multiple riders to cling to the side. In place of warships, the Dominion fields dragon turtles with siege staffs embedded into their shells. The sahuagin have also created entirely new forms of life. The alchemists of Hal'kyth used the blood and biomatter of the kar'lassa to create plasmids: protean creatures similar to mimics, but capable of replicating the texture of inanimate objects as well as shape. Plasmids can be guards--often serving as living doors to secure chambers--but they're also a useful tool of industry, as a trained plasmid can itself become the tools a sahuagin artisan needs to perform its work.",
												"Skilled Dominion magewrights can cast {@spell fabricate} as a ritual, shaping raw materials into their desired form through magic. The Dominion also uses a substance called {@i korlass} (\"dream stone\"), formed from dreamer biomass, as an industrial material; it can be sculpted like clay, then fixed in its shape by a magewright ritual. {@i Korlass} has the strength of steel, with a texture similar to shell, though its appearance varies depending on which kar'lassa it's drawn from.",
												"When considering the abilities of Dominion sahuagin, it's likely that storm priests are Tempest clerics or Conquest paladins, while dream priests are Knowledge clerics. Sahuagin artificers are usually Alchemists, and the most common forms of arcane spellcasters are sorcerers (either Storm Sorcery or Draconic Bloodline) and magewrights. Sahaugin warriors are typically Battle Masters or Champions, but some embrace the blood frenzy of barbarians. Bards, druids, wizards, and warlocks aren't supported by the traditions of the Dominion and are rarely encountered."

Locathah laborers are now found in all of the great cities, and there are farming communities across the seafloor where locathah are ruled by sahuagin overseers.",

The Aereni have greater knowledge of the Dominion, and have seen its power in the long conflict with the Valraean Protectorate.

So any adventurers who venture into the Dominion are pioneers, exploring unknown realms; academic institutions and dragonmarked houses alike will surely want to hear about their exploits.",

As such, the Dominion has much to offer Cannith, and securing a steady supply of Siberys shards would strengthen Merrix's position within his house. The trick is finding something the Dominion wants in return, and he's currently pursuing this. Merrix (and other dryskins) are as yet unaware of the vast resources of the kar'lassa; if they were discovered, and Cannith found a way to harness them, it could change the face of industry in Khorvaire.",

The first is that you're an alien, a creature with a face few recognize, and that those who do typically view with fear. The second is the Limited Amphibiousness trait possessed by both sahuagin and locathah--a need for regular immersion in water can be a crippling requirement when an adventure leads to the Blade Desert. However, the sahuagin have developed a solution that solves both of these problems. While most people of the Five Nations have never {@i seen} a sahuagin, that doesn't mean they've never {@i met} one. Scholars who study the sahuagin know of malenti, sahuagin that are born indistinguishable from sea elves; the common belief is that this is a random mutation that occurs when sahuagin and sea elves live in close proximity. The sahuagin are happy to support this myth, because the truth is far more disturbing: Malenti aren't born, they're {@i made}. One of the sacred rituals of Sha'argon allows a sahuagin priest to guide a subject through ritually consuming a humanoid--and in consuming the creature, the sahuagin {@i becomes} that creature, taking both their form and their powers. People know about sea elf malenti, as they've been caught and exposed in the Dominion's long war with the Protectorate.

While the Dominion has carried out a few targeted replacements to get malenti into influential positions, often malenti are just replacing people who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time: smugglers, fisherfolk, or pirates who strayed into Dominion territory. The purpose of this replacement isn't to take advantage of the character's previous life, but rather to place agents who can breathe on land and move freely without drawing attention.

										"The Thunder Sea has many strong manifest zones to Lamannia, the source of the endless storms that give the region its name. Nearly two centuries ago, an unusually strong convergence amplified the effects of the manifest zones. Both the Valraean Protectorate and the Eternal Dominion were lashed by the power of Lamannia, and there were fears that the barrier between worlds could be permanently damaged. At the height of this disaster, Kalamer merfolk were pulled through from Lamannia; finding themselves without a means to return home, they used their rites and rituals to contain and repair the damage. These wild zones in the upper waters have always been a threat, and once it became clear that Karakala could mitigate the danger, both the sahuagin and sea elves agreed to give them freedom to travel in the upper waters, so long as they managed the manifest zones. Today, many Kalamer consider the Thunder Sea their new home, and travel from zone to zone, practicing their primal traditions. In a sense, they're nomadic gardeners, preserving the wild. As they're recognized as neutral by both the Dominion and the Protectorate, they often serve as messengers, couriers, and mediators, carrying news and negotiating on behalf of these powers--an important role, as the sahuagin refuse to speak directly to the sea elves. The reach of Karakala extends along the southern coast of Khorvaire, and the arrival of a Kalamer bard is often a celebrated event in small Brelish or Zil fishing villages; more than once, they've managed to settle disputes between fisherfolk and the Dominion.",
										"Overall, Karakala is a neutral force, concerned above all with traveling between the manifest zones--which they call the roots--and performing the rituals that keep them stable.

												"Karakala is a culture rather than a nation. There are approximately ten thousand Kalamer spread across the Thunder Sea, but they claim no territory and have no single leader. Most live in small pods, following a pattern of migration between the manifest zones of the upper water. When they reach a manifest zone, they remain there for a week or so, performing primal rituals that stabilize the zone. They prize manifest zones to Lamannia, and time spent at a Lamannian zone is a time of celebration. However, they travel to all manifest zones, and their rituals can contain the harmful effects of any manifest zone.",
												"The Kalamer don't worship deities, but revere the forces of nature and believe the world speaks to those who listen. While outsiders might view this as worshiping Eberron, the Kalamer don't need to anthropomorphize nature for it to be worthy of reverence. The Kalamer value wisdom over strength, and the leader of the pod holds that position because the others trust their instincts; often they're an elder, but age isn't a requirement.",
												"In general, Karakala is peaceful; this is one reason both the Dominion and Protectorate allow the Kalamer to move freely. Most merfolk seek to understand any threats they encounter, to see if they can find a way to coexist--or failing that, to simply move past the danger. However, they can be dangerous foes when they're forced to act or encounter a true threat to the balance of nature.",
												"Kalamer fashion is simple and functional. It's rare for Kalamer to wear anything heavier than leather armor, and most just wear leather straps to hold their tools and personal possessions. Many carry small tokens--shells, stones, bones--that remind them of a place or moment. Sometimes humans describe hearing the sound of the ocean in a shell; however, many Kalamer truly receive primal impressions from natural objects.",
												"Kalamer speak Aquan, their native tongue from Lamannia. Most of them also speak either Elvish, Common, or Sahuagin, depending on where their route takes them, and merfolk bards may speak all of these. Any Kalamer capable of casting at least one Druidic spell can speak Druidic, which they consider to be the language of the wind and water."

Currently, they work to contain the manifest zones of the Thunder Sea and to keep peace; but if they chose, they could instead release the power of these zones to terrible effect. Hostile Kalamer could begin by calling elemental tempests and megafauna beasts from Lamannia and unleashing them into shipping lanes, increasing the dangers of the sea--with plausible deniability as to their source. By coordinating rituals with coterminous periods, the Kalamer could dramatically enhance the effects of manifest zones. Using the Lamannia zones in this way, they could create devastating hurricanes and tsunamis. Could tidal waves devastate Stormreach, or elemental hurricanes topple one of the towers of Sharn? Karakala has no interest in conquest; if the merfolk pursued this course of action, it would purely be to drive commerce and civilization from the sea."

										"Long ago, the waters along the western coast of Aerenal were inhabited by peaceful locathah. The sahuagin of Sha'argon's Kingdom--a predecessor to the Eternal Dominion--steadily advanced toward Aerenal, conquering and assimilating the locathah. Concerned by the obvious aggression of the sahuagin, the Sibling Kings acted to secure the waters around Aerenal, establishing a buffer zone that would ensure that Sha'argon's Kingdom posed no direct threat. The line of Valraea was chosen, and through the power of the Undying Court, its nobles were physically transformed into {@race elf (sea)|MTF|sea elves}, gaining iridescent skin and the ability to breathe beneath the water.",
										"Initially, the line of Valraea served as protectors and advisors, organizing the locathah and helping them construct superior defenses. Then the attacks began. The conflict slowly escalated; the harder the locathah fought, the more it drove sahuagin determination to claim the region. Valraean priests brought the full power of the Undying Court to bear against the attackers, and Sha'argon's Kingdom couldn't match their transcendent might. A generation later the sahuagin returned, and the elves retaliated, using the divine power of the Undying Court to seize the Sha'argon border fortresses. It was at this time--when the region claimed included both sahuagin and locathah lands--that the elves officially declared it the Valraean Protectorate. According to the proclamation, the Undying Court would protect all peoples of the Protectorate and the line of Valraea would provide them with guidance and security... all of which was a gentle way of saying that the people were now under Aereni rule and would be forced to embrace Aereni customs. While this decision was driven in part by a desire to ensure the island's security, it may have also been tied to the discovery of dragonshard deposits along the seabed--both fallen Siberys shards and indications of deep Khyber shards.",
										"The next thousand years brought chaos, as the sahuagin--first Sha'argon's Kingdom, then the Eternal Dominion--continued to attack and the Valraean elves continued to retaliate by conquering additional sahuagin territories. But the power of the Undying Court is geographically limited. While clerics can draw on the power of the Court to cast spells anywhere in the world, the transcendent might that can repel dragons or defeat sahuagin armies has a limited range. When the elves pressed beyond that, they suffered terrible losses; and yet, the Dominion couldn't challenge the elves within the Court's sphere of influence. This began a long stalemate that continues to this day. The Eternal Dominion has launched numerous attacks over the last few centuries, testing the power of the Undying Court, but thus far, the might of the deathless has been sufficient to repel every sahuagin assault.",

In Aerenal, any elf can prove themselves worthy of joining the noble line. In the Protectorate, subjects likewise strive to prove their worth--but in this case, they seek to be worthy of {@i serving} the elves of the noble line. Valraean subjects are raised to believe that all elves are semidivine beings. They're ancient and wise, masters of powerful magic and remarkable skills... and most importantly, only elves can ascend to join the Undying Court.",

They're idolized and adored from birth, and have been playing the role of divine guardians and guides for so long that many have come to believe it: they {@i were} shaped by the Undying Court to be the guardians of the sea, and they do stand above their adoring subjects. But while the Valraean sea elves are often arrogant and overconfident, they generally strive to live up to that vision, to protect anyone in their charge, to be the noble and gracious rulers that (most of) their subjects imagine them to be. They aren't petty tyrants; they believe in ensuring the safety and security of their people--but they also feel no qualms about the fact that their subjects are ultimately trapped in their lives, with all positions of power held by sea elves. They consider their privilege logical and natural; and so do the overwhelming majority of Valraean subjects, who believe the elves, with their long lives and deathless ancestors, are more capable than other mortals could ever be with their fleeting lifespans.",
												"Meanwhile, Valraean subjects believe they too are elevated above all outsiders, lower than the elves, but still blessed to receive the guidance of the elves and the living (or rather, deathless) gods of the Undying Court. And most subjects strive to prove themselves worthy of this blessing. All subjects of the Protectorate receive an education and learn trades. Its people engage in simple industry that no Aereni elf wants to dirty their hands with, as well as laboring to provide an important source of dragonshards for the mainland. In all of this, Valraeans are generally honest and industrious, trying to emulate the Aereni and perfect their skills; but they're taught that they'll never be as gifted as elves, since an Aereni elf spends an entire locathah lifetime in just their initial studies. This reflects the cornerstone of Valraean culture, which is, boiled down, that {@i elves are glorious and better at everything than you}. As a Valraean you're just lucky to be near elves, to have their guidance and protection. It's your duty to honor the Undying Court, because without it, you would be torn apart by the vicious sahuagin in the cruel world outside the Protectorate.

The line of Valraea has long worked to stamp out all traces of the native cultures, replacing the local languages with Elvish and eliminating the locathah religion. Few subjects publicly challenge elven rule, but those who do are quickly silenced. But despite these efforts, there are those among the masses who resist the Valraean propaganda and seek to reclaim and preserve their ancient traditions. Rebel sahuagin may work with malenti and support Dominion espionage. The locathah have a more difficult path, as for their kind, life in the Dominion would be even worse than in the Protectorate.

Regardless, the Valraeans' ongoing adoration of the Undying Court provides a valuable source of positive energy for the Court itself.",

Fine leather takes the place of cloth, and Valraeans generally wear less clothing than their counterparts on the surface.

As in Aerenal, masks are important accessories; elves wear full face masks, while accomplished non-elves generally wear masks that cover their lower faces.",

														"A dragon rains fire down on a platoon of soldiers in Shavarath. Cheering crowds throng the streets of the Amaranthine City of Irian. Dragon, soldiers, crowds--none of these things are truly real. When you dream that you're taking a test at Arcanix, the sarcastic professor and mocking students aren't fully sentient spirits; they're manifestations of Dal Quor, created for that scene, and as soon as you wake, they'll vanish. These creatures can appear to be sentient, and you might be able to have a conversation with soldiers in Shavarath--but they won't have anything to say that you couldn't imagine coming out of the mouth of an extra in a war movie. As a general rule, manifestations can't leave the layers of the planes that they're in, and like dreams, they usually don't persist indefinitely; when their purpose is served, they simply evaporate until they're needed again. Very rarely, a manifestation might develop a more independent, sentient existence--like the drifters of Dal Quor--though they're generally still bound to their plane of origin and unable to deviate from their central purpose.",
														"Manifestations vary by plane; in Dal Quor they're called figments, while in Shavarath, they're conscripts. In some planes, the manifestations are formed from the soul-stuff of mortals, while in others they're entirely imaginary. A plane never runs out of the potential for manifestations, but these creatures typically follow the internal logic of a scene. If you fight a dragon in Shavarath, it feels just like fighting an actual dragon, and when you kill it, it seems dead and you can enjoy your victory. However, if you return a day later, there's no sign of the corpse, and instead, there's a new dragon in the sky.",
														"Some planes don't have manifestations of creatures, because the ideas they represent don't need them. Instead, these planes generally rely on native mortals to make up the supporting cast. So while Shavarath needs a constant churn of conscripts in battle, and Dal Quor creates figments to flesh out mortal dreams, other planes--Dolurrh, Fernia, Lamannia, and Syrania--don't create manifestations. For example, Lamannia needs mortal beasts to tell its story; birth, growth, and even death are part of its concept, and reflecting that requires a mortal population."

The name \"immortal\" doesn't mean \"unkillable\"--they can indeed be killed (as discussed in the \"Killing Immortals\" sidebar). While immortals don't show the effects of age, some have a limited lifespan and can die a natural death as well. However, their {@i essence} is immortal and their numbers remain constant.",
														"Most immortals don't care about Eberron. Many consider Eberron to be an unfinished experiment, while their realm is the finished, perfected work of the Progenitors. Others simply believe in their purpose to the exclusion of all other things; to the angel of Shavarath, the eternal battle is the single most important struggle in the multiverse, and leaving their post for even an instant could give the enemy an advantage. So most immortals aren't concerned with the fates of mortals or their civilizations; of course mortals may die, that's their most defining feature. An angel has seen many human civilizations rise and fall--what's one more? While there are a few exceptions--immortals who chose to dwell on Eberron, whether to prey on mortals, observe them, or assist them--immortals are generally bound to their planes, and your problems are not their problems.",
														"Immortals don't reproduce as mortal creatures do; if they're killed, their spiritual essence is instead reabsorbed into the plane and eventually reassembled. For example, in Shavarath, angels and devils are constantly being killed, but they're just as quickly being reborn to fight again. Immortals are each born as embodiments of specific ideas and don't choose their path; they're already mature, possessing their full abilities and knowledge, and imbued with an absolute understanding of their purpose. So while immortals possess great power, they lack the potential of mortals to grow and evolve, and find the idea of questioning their beliefs or straying from their purpose to be inconceivable.",

Lesser immortals may return with the same abilities, but with a new appearance, memories, or personality. The number of immortals remains the same, but it's a new incarnation of the idea. The only way to permanently eliminate an immortal is to somehow contain or redirect its spiritual essence; this is why the Silver Flame bound the overlords instead of destroying them.",
																"While immortals can't be destroyed, it's possible that the manner of a creature's death, or circumstances that follow, could delay the return of a particular immortal, or force it to return as a new incarnation instead of retaining its memories. The DM could choose to make these general rules for a type of creature--perhaps immortals from Shavarath return in 24 hours if they're killed on Shavarath, but it takes 6 months for them to return if they're killed on Eberron. Or it could be extremely specific: the devil Hashtorak returns within a day of his death, but if he's killed with the Spear of Miron he'll be banished for ten years."

Likewise, radiant idols are angels of Syrania that were corrupted by their time on the Material Plane and desired mortal adoration. But these examples are vanishingly rare. Sometimes it's because the unusual immortal is born embodying a unique perspective on the usual concept; this is essentially a mutation, as opposed to a choice. In other cases, an outside force might change or corrupt the immortal's fundamental nature. And rarely, an immortal might have an unusual sense of identity and the ability to choose.",
														"If an immortal changes in a way that alters its core concept, this is often accompanied by a physical transformation, such as a corrupted angel becoming a radiant idol, thus losing its ability to fly. Immortals may be able to increase their abilities by absorbing other immortals, acquiring artifacts, or through other means unique to their plane. They simply don't grow or gain experience through time alone; after all, some of them are as old as the universe itself, and in the absence of a dramatic cause, they're utterly unchanging."

In some planes, mortals are either subjugated by immortals or voluntarily serve them; in others, they pursue their own paths. In some cases--such as the merfolk of Lamannia or the eladrin of Thelanis--these creatures are natives of their home plane, were created by it, and have always been a part of it.

With this in mind, the planes of Eberron are divided into layers--distinct environments or realms that aren't bound by the laws of physical space nor physically connected. These layers can be tiny, seemingly infinite, or anything in between. A desert may wrap back upon itself, the alleys in a city could twist in impossible ways to always return you to the main square, or you could come to an absolute edge, where everything falls away into an endless void.",
												"Many scholars--including Dorius Alyre ir'Korran in his celebrated {@i Planar Codex}--describe the layers of a plane as a stack; however, the planes of Eberron aren't physically arranged in a particular order, and there's no concept of a top or bottom layer. Instead, each layer explores a different facet of the core concept that defines the plane. Lamannia is the Plane of Nature, and each layer showcases a particular environment--there's an endless ocean, a vast forest, a volcano forever on the edge of erupting. Shavarath is the Plane of War, and each layer contains a different aspect of war--a bitter siege, a bloody melee, a lingering guerilla conflict. Some planes have a core layer that serves as the heart of the plane, such as the Amaranthine Cities of Mabar and Irian. But the layers of Lamannia are all equal in importance.",
												"While they aren't stacked, most planes have layers bound by a reliable set of connections. The shape of these connections varies based on the plane. Some are obvious: a massive door sitting in the desert, a pool that reflects a scene from another layer. Others are more subtle; if you come upon an island while sailing on the Endless Ocean of Lamannia and you walk inland, you'll find that the island is a completely different layer--and when you turn around, the ocean is no longer behind you. A portal doesn't have to be physical at all; in Thelanis, you can travel to a new layer by acting out the elements of a new story.",
												"This chapter provides examples of notable layers for each plane, but these are only a sampling. Just as ideas have no limits, there are no limits on the number of layers a plane can contain. In developing or describing a layer to fit your story, keep the core concept of the plane in mind. What differentiates the vast fortress citadel of Irian's Amaranthine City from a fortress in Shavarath? A fortress in Shavarath is about war; the stones are worn, and there's a scent of blood and smoke in the air. In Irian, the fortress is a symbol of hope, of an empire on the rise; it's bright, clean, and may have never seen an actual battle. So while the layers of two planes might initially sound similar, look back to the core concept and consider how that's reflected in each layer."

On the other hand, when a plane is {@i remote}, its power fades; since the planes are always influencing the Material in subtle ways, their absence impacts the world as strongly as their presence does. Multiple planes can be coterminous at the same time; these planar conjunctions are often related to the interactions of the moons, and characters proficient in Arcana can usually work out upcoming conjunctions.",

They can drive a villain's plot: {@i Lady Illmarrow must be stopped from activating the device in three days' time, when both Mabar and Dolurrh are coterminous--a conjunction that won't happen again for another century!}",
														"It's ultimately up to the DM to decide when planes are coterminous or remote. If it suits the story for Dolurrh to be remote for the next three days, make it so--just be sure to inform the arcane scholars among the adventurers, who'd likely know such a thing in advance. Other DMs might prefer to have concretely established cycles, which can add their own interesting flavor to an adventure. For example, Mabar is always coterminous on the nights of the new moon closest to the winter solstice, a time known as Long Shadows. On these nights, friends and family gather together and keep lights burning through the night. With this in mind, this chapter does discuss the traditional cycle of each plane, when it's reliably coterminous or remote--just remember the cycles are there to enhance your story, not limit it!"

But there's a further complication, because the moons are also tied to the planes, as indicated on the Planar Destinations and Moons table. Each moon enters an additional ascendant phase whenever its associated plane is coterminous, and becomes unusually dim when the plane is remote. So while unusual, it's possible for there to be two or three ascendant moons at a time if multiple coterminous periods converge.",
														"The connection between the planes and moons is reinforced by the fact that while on a plane, its associated moon is the only one that can be seen in the sky (though not all planar layers have a visible sky, like the dismal caverns of Dolurrh). While on a moon's associated plane, the phase of the moon doesn't necessarily match its current phase on Eberron. It may be fixed in a single phase--such as in Lamannia, where the moon is always full--or its phase might even change from layer to layer. While on a plane, if the moon is visible, it can be identified with a successful {@dc 10} Wisdom ({@skill Nature}) check.",
														"To date, no humanoids have visited one of the moons. Because of this, their true nature remains a mystery. It's possible that they are orbiting, habitable planetoids, home to exotic creatures and valuable resources. But some sages believe that they aren't actually physical bodies at all, but rather, planar gateways--if an airship were to somehow fly high enough and attempt to land on a moon, perhaps it would instead pass into the sky of the associated plane. Determining the truth would be an epic adventure."

										"Reaching a demiplane requires a portal. In some cases, travel also requires rituals or planar conjunctions, and some portals may be impassable, sealed by the ancient wards of dragons or Gatekeeper druids. However, many portals are not only active, but nearly imperceptible; adventurers walking down a tunnel may pass through a portal to the Ironlands without ever knowing it. Portals are static, remaining in one place, and as long as one remains open, adventurers can always retrace their steps to return to it.",

The realm of Dyrrn the Corruptor has portals beneath the Shadow Marches and the Ironroot Mountains, while both the Kech Shaarat goblinoids of Darguun and the Ghaash'kala orcs of the Demon Wastes make use of portals tied to the Ironlands. As such, demiplanes can allow rapid travel across long distances; adventurers could enter a demiplane below Q'barra, walk what seems like only a mile, then emerge from a tunnel into Breland. Demiplanes have much in common with Eberron's thirteen planes. Natural laws may not apply within, and time, space, or other elements may behave in unnatural ways. A demiplane could have some of the properties of another plane, like the Burning Bright property of Fernia or the Primordial Matter property of Lamannia.

Others believe that demiplanes are unfinished ideas--early drafts of reality or seeds that never quite became planes.",

It's possible to be a mile below the surface of Eberron when you discover a valley that appears to be open to the sky... but it's not the sky of Eberron!

Each one is bound to and reincarnated in a particular demiplane within Khyber--the heart of an overlord. This is one reason the overlords can't be permanently destroyed; each is part of the architecture of Khyber itself, and the overlord's form that can be encountered in Eberron is simply a projection of its essence. To defeat the overlords, the champions of the Age of Demons used the Silver Flame to bind their immortal essence, preventing them from returning to their heart demiplane to reform. This essentially severed the brain from the heart--but the heart demiplanes still exist. The lesser servants of the overlord--its rakshasa and other fiend minions--return to the heart when they reform, and should an overlord's bonds be broken, it will recover its full strength in its heart realm.",

While the overlords aren't consciously present in their hearts, their essences still permeate them. Heart realms are typically inhabited by a host of lesser fiends bound to that overlord. Many have no desire to return to Eberron until their overlords are free, while others serve in the Lords of Dust, using the heart as a refuge.

But when Dorius Alyre ir'Korran drew his classic planar map (seen at the beginning of this book), he used the Octogram symbol of the Sovereign Host to represent Dolurrh, because he declared it to be the door through which all mortals must pass to join with the Sovereigns. This has come to be a common view: what appears to be memory fading is actually the soul slowly ascending to a higher form of existence, rising to a level of reality no mortal can experience. The Vassals of the Sovereign Host say the faithful finally join the Sovereigns; followers of the Silver Flame say that noble souls strengthen the Flame. What is left is only a husk--the cast-off remnants, like an abandoned snakeskin or the traces of memory that can be read using {@spell speak with dead}.

										"Returning life to the dead isn't a reliable service in Eberron. Many characters are capable of casting the necessary spells, from clerics to adepts of House Jorasco. But just because a spell {@i can} be cast doesn't mean that it {@i should} be cast... or that it will work if it does. The first and simplest limitation is time. The longer a spirit remains in Dolurrh, the more it falls under the sway of ennui. Any spell that returns life to the dead requires the spirit to {@i want} to return. Once the shade becomes a husk, it can no longer make that decision, and thus can't be raised or reincarnated. Most religions maintain that this happens because the true soul has moved on to a higher level of existence; who wants to be pulled back from a union with the Sovereigns? So you only have about a week or two--depending on the strength of the target's will--to pull them back. But even before that time, a spirit might choose not to return. What do they have to live for? Is it worth fighting the lulling ennui of Dolurrh?",
										"The second limitation is risk. Even if a spell is successful, Jorasco remains rightly concerned about whether that person is {@i supposed} to come back, or if it's their time to die--for if it's the latter, a marut may appear to challenge any resurrection. This is extraordinarily rare, but in part, that's because healers perform an {@spell augury} ritual beforehand and refuse to raise someone if there's a risk. Even if a marut doesn't intervene, there's a risk the resurrection could go poorly if Dolurrh is coterminous, perhaps calling back other spirits in addition to--or instead of--the person being brought back to life.",
										"The final limitation is the direct intervention of a higher power. The Queen of the Dead might crystallize a shade and prevent it from being restored, or catch a spirit that's about to be restored and set a price on its passage; a few examples are given on the Cost of a Life table. How long does the beneficiary have to settle their account? A day, a year, a lifetime? It's also said that the Keeper can snatch souls before they even reach Dolurrh; if this myth is true, such souls can only be recovered from the Lair of the Keeper in the Demon Wastes. The Keeper itself may or may not be there, but it's certainly the abode of a powerful dracolich!",
										"The flip side of direct intervention is that the Queen of the Dead (or another powerful entity) might offer to return a shade to life--for a price. This is a way to bring a low-level character back to life, despite their friends being unable to afford resurrection. {@table The Cost of a Life|ExploringEberron} table provides ideas.",
										"If all else fails, there's one way you can always bring someone to life: go to Dolurrh, find their shade, and drag it back out to the Material Plane. It's simple--all you need to do is to locate a single soul in the endless Catacombs (perhaps with the help of a native guide, records in the Vault of Memories, or powerful divination magic), evade Dolurrh's many guardians, and return to Eberron with the soul in tow. If you succeed, the victim receives a new body, just as if you'd cast {@spell true resurrection}; and while Dolurrh's defenders will try to stop you from leaving, they won't interfere once you return to Eberron. It's theoretically possible to restore a husk in this way as well, though the resurrected husk generally won't regain its lost memories, even though it might learn new skills. As a result, it wouldn't do any good to bring back the Tairnadal ancestors or Galifar I; you could bring a {@i body} back to life, but it's not the original person in any meaningful way. This is why the Queen of the Dead (and perhaps the Keeper) preserves certain shades from decay--so that they might one day be restored, even after thousands of years."

This could be exactly what it appears; the Queen of the Dead may despise necromancers, and Vol is seeking to depose her. But perhaps there's more to it.

Perhaps Erandis will {@i become} the Queen of the Dead, in which case, she'll have always been her.

Mabar is an exception: the Endless Night steals and corrupts fragments of other planes, adding them to its layers. Left unchecked, Mabar would consume reality. But as the Endless Night consumes, the Eternal Dawn creates. Whenever Mabar tears a fragment from another plane, a new planar seed appears in Irian. Initially, this is a small layer, populated by embers and lumi, that has Irian's planar properties. Over time, the layer grows and evolves, and the environment and its inhabitants take on the appearance of the void it's to fill. Little by little, it loses the properties of Irian and adopts the properties of its destination plane; when it finally loses the Light of Life property, its ties to Irian are severed and it fully becomes part of the other plane, replacing the region lost to Mabar.",
												"The planar seed is rarely a perfect match for the fragment that was lost. The embers take the form of local life, but especially for fragments torn from the Material Plane, a planar seed doesn't replace sentient creatures or buildings; it simply restores land and wildlife. If the Mourning had been the work of Mabar--which is unlikely for many reasons, but not impossible--Irian wouldn't restore the people killed in the Mourning or the destroyed structures, but it would restore life to the land and make it a welcoming environment.",
												"In most planes, immortals can't reproduce, but they're reborn if they die, and their numbers remain constant. Irian breaks that rule, because it creates new immortals to replace those corrupted by Mabar. These begin as lumi and angels, but as the seed loses its properties, these immortals evolve into the denizens of that plane, drawing their personalities from the template for the new immortals. Irian makes no judgment about the spaces it fills, and it may create a squad of bloodthirsty demons when it replaces a lost fragment of Shavarath. These seed immortals can't leave their layer until it's fully bound to their final plane, so they can't wreak havoc in Irian, but it would be quite a surprise for nosy adventurers that stumble into that layer!",

Unlike the embers, who aren't fully conscious or aware of the memories they hold, lumi are sentient creatures, each with a unique identity, though their sparks give them fragments of many mortal lives. So adventurers may meet a lumi who recognizes them, and who has a few memories and traits of a fallen friend.",

Their statistics can be represented by the {@creature priest} in the {@book Monster Manual|mm} (or an exceptionally powerful one might use the statistics of the {@creature war priest|VGM} in {@book Volo's Guide to Monsters|VGM}), but they don't need to eat, drink, breathe, or sleep, they don't age, and they're immune to poison and disease. When a lumi reaches 0 hit points, its body dissolves and its sparks fade. If an angel of Irian is nearby, it can consume these sparks; this won't save the lumi, but at least those memories are preserved. While most lumi are humanoids, there may be lumi formed from the sparks of other creatures, like giants or dragons, that dwell in layers of their own kind.",

Lumi help develop and maintain the planar seeds, and some even surrender their identity in order to become new creatures within that seed; they believe that in doing this, they're sowing the new layer with light. On rare occasions, lumi travel to other planes in service of the Architects. They are brave and compassionate, seeking always to spread hope, and ever prepared to lay down their lives for the greater good.

												"The islands of Kythri are inhabited. But how can a creature survive in an environment that can be a desert today and a glacier tomorrow? The answer, of course, is that the creature must change with the environment. Kythri's islands include some creatures that appear to be natural beasts, though they change as the region around them does; the wolf in the forest becomes an arctic wolf when the land turns into a glacier, and turns into a jackal when it's a desert. Even beyond their practical changes for survival, Kythrian creatures might be constantly shifting their plumage, behavior, and more fundamental biology, whether from moment to moment or day to day.",
												"However, not all of Kythri's wild things transform into familiar forms. Part of the plane's core concept is evolving in response to change, and Kythri is home to many creatures that blend the features of two or more natural beasts: monstrosities such as the owlbear, griffon, and chimera. It's commonly accepted that at least some of these monstrosities first appeared in Kythri, and that they first appeared in Eberron either by passing through portals or due to the influence of manifest zones.",
												"Just as the environments of Kythri are chaotic but largely blend natural elements, Kythrian monstrosities typically blend the forms of natural creatures. While there are hippogriffs and griffons in Kythri, inherently alien creatures like kruthiks and gricks aren't found here. The wild things of Kythri also include natural shapechangers, notably a wide variety of mimics--even colossal ones that can assume the shape of natural features such as hills or mountains. It's quite likely the mimics of Eberron either immigrated from Kythri or were created by its influence, much like the sahuagin of the Eternal Dominion use the blood of the kar'lassa bound to Kythri to create their plasmids.",
												"Unlike other planes where these wild things would likely be manifestations, the wild things of Kythri are mortal creatures. They live, reproduce, and die following (mostly) natural means, and have to find sustenance and shelter in their islands. Between the strange flow of time and unusual environments, this can lead to dramatic surges in populations or sudden extinctions. However, the plane itself seeds new life into islands that somehow become depopulated, and if all the griffons in Kythri were to die, new ones would eventually evolve. So even though Kythri doesn't have manifestations, it ensures a steady stream of mortals exist--and when they die, it replaces them."

Whenever a new slaad is born--whatever the method of its creation--an existing slaad dies, seemingly at random. And whenever a slaad is killed, a new one is formed. So while they seem to share many of the traits of mortals, they can never be wiped out even if they die en masse, and even if a blue slaad transforms a village of humans into slaadi with the chaos phage, the overall number of slaadi doesn't increase.",

Each slaad community has its own distinct culture and a grand name, and the {@table Slaad Cultures|ExploringEberron} table provides a few examples of these--but there are many more, and they're constantly changing. The grand city of Cornerstone may be the seat of the brutal Concordance of Iron today, and the Enlightened Lyceum League a month later. These changes are astonishingly fast, but they aren't instant; there are usually at least a few days of chaotic transition and revolution in between a change. The scope of a community won't change--Cornerstone is always a metropolis, while Turn is always a village--but the structures of the community shift. Under the Concordance of Iron, Cornerstone is filled with brutalist iron towers, while the Cornerstone of the Lyceum League is filled with slender glass spires.",

Red slaadi are always red toad-like creatures that implant eggs, but the Lyceum slaadi might be tall and slender, while the Concordance slaadi are squat and heavy. Kythri's influence can also cause slaadi to change color. So slaadi follow standard methods for creating particular colors--a blue slaad infects creatures with chaos phage, creating red or green slaadi--but a green slaad could go to sleep one night and wake up as a death slaad, and vice versa. In a culture like the Concordance, that means leadership frequently changes, because it's based on color, not personality.",

When defeat was inevitable, the great leader Gith led a planar exodus, fleeing into Kythri. The Churning Chaos hid the refugees from pursuit, and through absolute discipline, they imposed stability upon chaos.",

Alternately, a githyanki merchant could be a recurring NPC, showing up and offering items pillaged from across the planes.

They came from a world surrounded by the Ring of Siberys, but there were no humans or elves on their Eberron. According to the githzerai, when the daelkyr completed their work on Eberron, they wiped the gith world from existence and created a new reality. If this is true, they may have done this countless times... and if they break the Gatekeeper seals, they could do it again. What the githzerai ultimately hope to achieve is to reassert their reality onto the Material Plane.",

These include the standard earth, fire, air, and water elementals, but they can come in a wide array of sizes and forms. Adventurers exploring the Broken Lands could encounter tiny globs of lava crawling across the land, while the leviathans of the Endless Ocean and the elder tempests of the First Storm are forces of apocalyptic power.",

They have little concept of time and perceive the world purely through the balance of elements. The sole desire of most elementals is to express their element: to {@i burn}, to {@i flow}, to {@i fly}. Many have an antagonistic attitude toward spirits of other elements, which drives the deadly conflict between them in the Broken Land--this poses an obstacle in dealing with elementals, as they tend to perceive humanoids as globs of water.

Meanwhile, primal instincts are amplified; Lamannian werewolves remain predators and take joy in the hunt, but they aren't driven to evil, and remain in full control. Packs and communities of lycanthropes are scattered across the layers. Most are descended from lycanthropes who fled Eberron to escape both the templars and the dark power whose corrupting influence led to the crusade; these shapeshifters embrace their primal nature and rarely assume humanoid forms. But there are also packs descended from afflicted templars who chose exile over death, and who strive to preserve the beliefs and traditions of their ancestors.",

However, Mabar typically claims a region the size of a town, or perhaps a county; it's never been known to claim an entire country. Typically the fog fades within a day, leaving a barren region stripped of vegetation and structures. Mabar's power is such that it also consumes the memories of the place; most mortals simply forget that the affected region ever was anything but barren, and forget the people consumed in the process. This process isn't perfect or absolute, but when contradictory information is presented, people instinctively try to rationalize it. Maybe they heard a story about the lost town? The uncle who lived in that town? Didn't he die in the war? In short, player characters might realize something is wrong, but be unable to convince others of it. Because of this magical effect and the fact that it happens so rarely, the common people of Khorvaire don't know about this aspect of Mabar.

A layer might contain a massive battlefield filled with the intertwined bones of dragons and giants. Ossuaries and catacombs. Crumbling memorials, with names too faded to read. Barren orchards and dried riverbeds. And tombs, from tiny unmarked crypts to the death-palaces of fallen rulers, necropolises filled with traps and treasures.

Irian shows the city in its first days of glory: prosperous, clean, full of joy and life. The Amaranthine City of Mabar is a haunted shadow of this glory. Like its counterpart, this immense metropolis fills an entire layer, but here, its banners are faded and torn, walls are cracked, and fountains are dry. Shadows still move through the streets, a miserable reminder of the crowds that once filled the city. The rotting tapestries and chipped mosaics speak of a past age of wonders and glory. The two are unmistakably the same city, both in architectural style and the layout of its streets. This feels like the last days of a grand empire, an image of decaying grandeur; but there's great power beneath the tragic façade. The walls may be cracked, but they are still mighty, and the mezzoloth's rusty trident can kill you as easily as a polished one.",
												"The city's ruler, the Empress of Shadows, is the first and greatest of the Dark Powers. Her defining principle is hunger, the desire to consume all that is light, to expand her empire across eternity. She prefers an elegant fiendish form, with polished horns and chitin plates engraved with arcane sigils, but she can take the shape of any yugoloth. She spends much of her time presiding over the decaying pomp and grandeur of the Amaranthine City, but also closely monitors the campaigns in the Hinterlands and occasionally takes time to torment her hostages. The sages of Syrania believe that the Empress of Shadows chooses which fragments of other planes will be pulled into Mabar, and planar emissaries sometimes dwell in the Amaranthine City seeking to negotiate with her.",
												"This city is the seat of the yugoloths; for every yugoloth in the Amaranthine City of Mabar, there is an angel in the city in Irian, all the way up to the Dawn Empress and the Empress of Shadows. Most likely, this is just a way of reflecting the planes' core concepts--beginnings and endings, hope and despair. But it's possible that Irian and Mabar are somehow the same--perhaps the Dawn Empress is the Empress of Shadows, and though they appear to exist at the same time, they reflect the beginning and end of the same spirit.",
												"The layers tied to the Amaranthine City reflect its theme of imperial ambition and decaying power. Some embody desperation--a collapsing fortress awaiting an assault that will surely destroy it, or an abandoned sanitarium whose inmates are trapped and starving. These regions are inhabited by shadows, but the fiendish gardeners can instill near-sentience into them if it serves their purposes. Fragments claimed by the Empress of Shadows are drawn into her empire, and usually acquire a yugoloth outpost even as the life is drained from the region."

The gates are shattered, and bloodstains and broken weapons are scattered across the floors. The people of this domain fought a dreadful war and lost... but this being Mabar, their bones remain. The skeletons of peasants continue their menial labors, seemingly oblivious to the futility of their actions. Even in death, these commoners are oppressed by their cruel lords. Wights, deathlocks, and vampire spawn might serve as the soldiers of the tyrants, while the overlords themselves may be vampires or mummy lords, still ruling from their ruined keeps.",

He can serve as an Undying patron for warlocks, and is known to teach mortal wizards the foul rituals that allow ascension to lichdom.

Meanwhile, cruel specters and banshees attend the Queen, along with succubi and incubi who bask in the delicious misery that suffuses the region. The Queen herself takes the form of a mummified corpse, enshrouded by a spectral image of a beautiful elf woman. The suffering of others is her mead, and her only pleasure is the slow torment of the hostages in her Hinterland fragments.",

She was once a mortal who dreamed of mastering life and death, but her pursuit of these goals resulted in the deaths of everyone she ever loved and everyone who shared her blood. Her kingdom was razed, and she killed her own daughter and transformed her into a lich, so at least one piece of her legacy might survive. Her name was Minara Vol, and she was the mother of Erandis Vol. In the process of becoming a Dark Power, she's lost much of her own identity and sense of her past. She despises both elves and dragons, but has forgotten even her own daughter. If the Queen were to somehow regain her memories, she might seek to strike at the Undying Court and Argonnessen, or to aid Erandis--or it may be that she continues to dwell in her despair and ignore her past.",

A floating tower of Syrania? Or is it a piece of the Material Plane--a fortress plucked out of the Last War or a Riedran village? The second question is how long the fragment has been under siege. To what degree does it retain its original flavor, and how much has the influence of Mabar oventaken it? The final question is which of the Dark Powers has claimed it--and why? What is it about this region that draws it towards a Dark Power's domain? The Empress of Shadows looks for places that shine too brightly--places that bask in their achievements, sure their glory will never fade. The Bone King claims fragments where commoners suffer or where rulers turn to tyranny; there are a few Karrnathi fragments in his domain, though it can be hard to tell how close they are to being subsumed. The Queen of All Tears seeks the places where terrible tragedies have occurred, forcing the inhabitants to forever dwell in these moments of misery. With fragments of the outer planes, it's more a question of reshaping the plance to fit these stories. By contrast, when it comes to the Material Plane, it's the story itself that often draws the dire hand of Mabar."

In others, it's twisted in strange ways; plants may seek the blood of living creatures, or grow unnaturally pale and cold. Rot and decay are often accelerated, and disease can thrive. However, such regions are also often powerful sources of negative energy. Mabaran zones often possess the Necrotic Power universal property, and there are epic rituals and eldritch machines that require a Mabaran manifest zone. The Odakyr Rites that create Karrnathi undead are an example of this, and the Karrnathi city of Atur is built on a Mabaran zone. This often has a curious synergy: if the negative energy of a Mabaran manifest zone is regularly channeled into rituals or spells, it prevents that energy from spreading disease or killing vegetation. {@i In his War and Death: A History of Karrnathi Necromancy}, Jolan Hass Holan asserts that the plagues and famines Karrnath suffered early in the war were due to the Seekers who normally tended those zones being pushed out of them due to strategic concerns--which, in turn, forced Karrnath to embrace necromancy to counter the effects of those famines.",

This primarily occurs in regions that are suffused with despair or misery, and only at night, ending as soon as dawn breaks. As a result, during coterminous periods, friends and family usually huddle together indoors, keeping the lights burning and telling cheerful tales.",

Items that create undead or consume light might also be crafted from quintessence; such items drain joy and empathy from those that carry them, and those who wield such items often become cold and cruel.

In another layer, champions of justice ride armored dragons, assaulting a titanic airship. In yet another, steel krakens tear apart celestial frigates. There's only one constant in Shavarath: war.",
								"The war in Shavarath began at the moment of creation, and it will continue to the end of time. Its primary combatants are immortal, and fallen soldiers return within a day or so. The forces are so evenly matched that a decisive victory is impossible. To outsiders, this war seems pointless. Over the last four hundred years of conflict in Nullius Terram, the Legion of Justice has advanced its front line by perhaps 20 feet. Mortals may look at this and ask, \"Why continue to fight? Why not just leave the struggle and do something--anything--else?\" In particular, it's common for mortals to see the vast resources the celestials devote to the war and protest, \"Why don't you help us? You claim to be the Legion of Justice, but innocent people are dying in Thaliost while you fight this meaningless war!\"",
								"The angel isn't fighting for a single nation, and this war isn't driven by gold or politics. The immortals of Shavarathbelieve that their war is reflected across every reality. Justice. Tyranny. Cruelty. The war in Shavarath is a visible symbol of the balance of power between these forces, and when it shifts in Shavarath, the immortals believe it shifts everywhere. Fallen devils will be reborn. New airships will replace those destroyed. But every tiny victory--every demon defeated, every foot advanced in Nullius Terram--strengthens the forces of justice everywhere. Each angel knows they will never win a truly decisive victory, but as long as they fight, they can at least hold the line.",
								"So to an angel, the destruction of a human city--or an entire nation--is trivial. Mortals will die; that's their most defining trait. Even a sympathetic angel sees a mortal as a snowflake: unique, beautiful, but gone in a moment (and sooner if you touch it). The angels fought long before today's mortal civilizations existed, and if they hadn't held this line for countless eons, the Material Plane would be overrun by chaos and cruelty.",

Immortals can be reassigned to new cohorts, and promoted or demoted--usually tied to a physical transformation.

Sometimes an especially grand victory might cause an immortal to be \"discharged\"--when this happens, a new being of equivalent power takes its place, but it has a new personality, and the original spirit is eradicated.

Conscripts can use the statistics of the creatures they appear to be, but may not have their full capabilities; the dragons of the Burning Sky aren't as intelligent as true dragons.

Unlike standard conscripts, sword wraiths are capable of meaningful action even without the direction of an immortal and can command conscripts of their own. A sword wraith has the appearance of its mortal source and some of the memories, but it's only an echo of the mortal, much like the traces of memory that allow you to speak with dead. Sword wraiths reconcile their memories with the war within the layer. If there's a sword wraith of Karrn the Conqueror commanding troops in Nullius Terram, he believes that he's fighting for Karrnath and can't be convinced otherwise; after all, he's only a memory, and there are limits to his ability to reason.",

Dhakaani champions, the Mror clan founders, heroes of the Last War--any of these could be found as sword wraiths, serving the legion that best matches their values. There are sword wraiths of many patron ancestors of the Tairnadal elves; however, these aren't the patrons themselves, simply echoes left behind. While sword wraiths generally form after a mortal's death, the slivers of especially remarkable heroes can manifest sword wraiths even while alive.

In the Mror Holds, there's a tale older than Breland itself, in which Lady Narathun curses Doldarun's son with eternal sleep, until he's saved by humble Toldorath.

In a layer of Thelanis, the Lady in Shadow curses a prince with eternal sleep. She tends a garden full of wonders, and keeps her own daughter hidden in the heart of a labyrinth of thorns. At the deepest level, that is what the fey are: stories. The dryad isn't a natural spirit; it's the magic we want in the world when we see a slender tree move in the wind and imagine it as a beautiful person. Thelanis is built on iconic stories, but it's also the Faerie Court; at its heart, satyrs and nymphs dance in the shadows of the Palace of the Moon, while the archfey engage in immortal intrigues. It's a fantastic realm essentially built around the idea of adventures, but it's a deadly place for those who refuse to understand its rules.",

While most supporting cast are fey, any creature can appear if the story requires it. A pack of wolves? An angry giant? A white horse that appears just when it's needed? Anything is possible.",
												"Supporting cast generally use the standard stat blocks for each creature, though they might be considered fey instead of other creature types. These creatures don't think of themselves as manifestations; it's simply that they have no real depth, no desires other than the drives they need to fill their role in the story, and no care for the passage of time. The sprite never gets bored of its song, and it never stops to question anything about its existence.",
												"The supporting cast reflects the fact that the stories of Thelanis don't change. The hungry giant will always be guarding the well. If adventurers defeat the giant, they're the heroes of the hour and it feels like a triumph; but if they return to the barony at a later date, the giant will be back--or at least, a remarkably similar giant--and it won't remember them or acknowledge their previous victory. As a general rule, supporting cast can't abandon their posts or leave their layers.",
												"However, more than the manifestations of other planes, the supporting cast of Thelanis can evolve. When an anchor baron gives the white horse to an adventurer, it becomes a mortal horse and they can ride it home. Supporting cast that drift into manifest zones become mortal fey, dwelling in the zone until they die. A supporting cast member can also evolve by gaining a greater role in the story. An individual sprite doesn't even have a name, but if the adventureres convince the sprite to help them, and it plays a critical role in their defeat of the giant at the well, it's no longer a nameless sprice; it's Clever Jack, or whatever name they gave it. If a manifestation becomes mortal, it can go anywhere it likes, even leaving its layer and following the adventureres back to Eberron... but if it dies, it's gone forever. On the other hand, a manifestation can evolve to become a greater fey; if this happens, it remains immortal, and it's still tied to its story, just with a bigger role and more personality."

The second are natural-born mortals who do have their own cultures and cities; chief among these are the eladrin, who dwell in the feyspires of the Moonlit Vale. Each spire is ruled by an archfey, and each has a distinct story that shapes the personality of the local eladrin. The eladrin aren't as bound by story as other fey, but the magic of the plane encourages a deep devotion to their spire and their ruler. They hunt, they hold revels, they serve their ruler in the intrigues of the Moon Court; it rarely occurs to them that there could be more to life. However, they're indeed mortals; they fall in love, they have children, they are born, and they die. If an eladrin leaves their spire--whether to roam across Thelanis or into Eberron--they often gain a greater appreciation of the passage of time. Living among mortals in a mundane world can be a hard transition for an eladrin; compared to the wonders of the Faerie Court, there is little fey beauty in Khorvaire. The longer an eladrin lives in the mortal world, the more mortal it becomes; this is why eladrin player characters are considered humanoids (and elves) rather than fey.",

However, seasons are also used as a political statement, reflecting a degree of support for that season in the Moon Court; there may be times when an eladrin will resist assuming a particular aspect so as not to offend a host.",
												"The eladrin are the most common mortals in the layer, but there are also a handful of mortals who have been drawn in from Eberron--the gnomes of Pylas Pyrial, wandering Greensingers, mortals personally chosen by one of the archfey, or creatures who accidentally wandered through manifest zones and are trying to find their way home."

However, often the role of protagonist is left for the adventurers to fill; in Thelanis, {@i they} are the ones who must wake the Sleeping Prince.",

They want to achieve things within their story, but few have any thoughts or desires that go beyond Thelanis. However, it's possible for them to go wherever they want. A greater fey could establish its own domain in a manifest zone tied to Thelanis, or be found selling strange trinkets in the Immeasurable Market of Syrania. When greater fey do leave Thelanis, they generally seek to create their own stories; they still want to be part of a narrative that makes sense to them.",

A greater dryad might be able to see through all of the trees in the manifest zone she calls home, and to control its beasts. This isn't represented by a spell, as she couldn't control beasts in other places; it's simply part of the story.",

Where greater fey may be tied to a single story, most archfey have inspired countless tales--often as the antagonist, though they can also be benevolent. The Lady in Shadow is the archetype of the mighty witch who lives apart from society, whose anger can bring a terrible curse. She's the villain of the Sleeping Prince, but she also curses those who steal from her secret garden, and may have advice for those who approach her carefully and with gifts. In some cases, stories refer to the archfey by name. When something goes missing in the Five Nations, people in Eberron know the Forgotten Prince stole it; his story is explored in chapter 8. Other archfey inspire tales, but those stories are seen through a local lens. The Lady in Shadow set the story of the Sleeping Prince in motion long ago, but in Eberron, the villain of the story is Lady Narathun, or Hezhaal the dirge singer, or Sora Katra. This is fine with the Lady in Shadow; she doesn't need mortals to know her name.",

Some recruit agents directly, working with Greensingers or training warlocks or other emissaries; an archfey could serve as an immortal group patron for a group of adventurers. Typically, an archfey wants its agents to take actions relating to its story; the Forgotten Prince charges his agents to steal secrets and unloved things. Others don't want agents; they want mortals to reenact their stories, as in many versions of the Sleeping Prince. Hezhaal the dirge singer really did curse the marhu's son long ago, and Sora Katra is another real person who just happens to resemble the Lady in Shadow in some ways. Neither Katra nor Hezhaal knowingly served the Lady in Shadow--but she may have secretly aided them, or placed gifts or obstacles in their paths that might make them reenact the stories, unknowingly becoming avatars of the archfey. Archfey can't be permanently killed; as long as their stories are told, the archfey will reform. However, this usually involves a greater fey being promoted to fill the role; the archfey still exists, but they aren't exactly the same as the one that came before.",

While it's largely arboreal, there are beautiful valleys, glittering lakes, and a vast mountain. It's always night here, and the moon Rhaan radiates bright light, always seeming to hang just above the viewer. While the moon doesn't move or change, the seasons do; in winter, the court is covered in snow, while in spring, it's in brilliant flower. This has nothing to do with the passage of time, and everything to do with the intrigues of the Palace of the Moon; the current season indicates which seasonal court is currently dominant. This is a crucial aspect of the Moonlit Vale: {@i things change}. The baronies are fixed in their stories, but the intrigues of the four seasons are the story Thelanis tells itself.",
												"The Moonlit Vale embodies the general idea of the fey--otherworldy beauty and magic. There are many natural displays of illusion--streams of glowing mist, ethereal music, distant song. Motes of light drift slowly through the trees. The beasts of the region are sleek and graceful, and have unusual colors and patterns; while many use standard stat blocks, sentient beasts might use the statistics for Valenar beasts from {@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW} (though these aren't in any way related to the Tairnadal). The land is fertile, game is easy to hunt, and adventurers have advantage on foraging checks... though hunting without permission may incur the wrath of the local fey.",

The Summer Tree is in full bloom, while the Winter Tree is withered and bare. The four seasons are factions among the fey of the Moon Court, and those who dwell within the palace live within the tree of their season. The palace is full of endless intrigues, and envoys negotiate alliances with the feyspires and the anchor barons. To mortals, many of these intrigues would seem trivial and strange, but for the fey, they determine the ruling season, which sets the tone for the layer. At the apex of each season--perhaps a strangely arbitrary declaration in a realm with such a casual relationship to time--the fey of the ruling season host a grand revel, which draws archfey from all throughout the plane; this is a moment when intrigues bloom and stories are shaped, a time for duels and grand declarations.",

Each is home to a single archfey whose personal story is reflected by the spire, along with a few greater fey and a host of eladrin and other mortals. Many feyspires serve as planar beachheads; they are tied to specific manifest zones in Eberron, and when the time is right, they can slip into Eberron for a short time. Usually the feyspires are hidden by powerful illusions during these times, but there are stories of people stumbling into magical cities that are gone the next day.

												"More than with any other plane, Thelanian manifest zones often allow travel between the planes. Fey creatures dwell in such zones, and a greater fey may turn such a manifest zone into its personal domain. Just as fey can cross over from Thelanis, mortals can travel to the Faerie Court. Gateway zones always share the general environment of the layer they are connected to, though it's rarely obvious when this passage occurs, and it may take time for travelers to realize they have crossed over. However, there are always signs of a gateway--circles of mushrooms, strange patterns of vegetation, eerie lights, or faint, unearthly music the adventurers must follow. Gateways typically only activate at certain times--often when the moon Rhaan is full--and even then, there's usually something that must be done that violates a known superstition. If you stay on the path in the forest, you won't stumble into the Endless Weald. But if you follow the ghostly music, or chase the silvery deer? That's on you.",
												"Other manifest zones reflect the properties and influence of Thelanis without allowing passage between worlds. Zones with the Enchanted Realm property are much sought after by House Phiarlan and House Thuranni. Zones with Storybook Logic break the rules of reality in specific ways; the Grove of Promises is a clearing that holds an old stone fountain. Stories from the nearby village say that if you make a promise to someone and then share a drink from the fountain, you must keep your word--and if you are false, you'll sicken and die. The people of the town perform marriages in the Grove. Young lovers sneak away to pledge their hearts. There are even merchants who like to seal their deals in the Grove. The people of the town never break a promise sworn in the Grove... will you?",
												"A final form of manifest zone is the beachhead; this phenomenon periodically draws a piece of Thelanis into Eberron. The feyspires mentioned earlier are an example of this, but a beachhead can be any unusual location--sure to be a local legend, but rarely be found by those searching for it, only uncovered by chance. There's a tale in the Mror Holds of the Tomb of the Forgotten King, found when a traveler seeks shelter in a cave and discovers deeper passages. Following these tunnels, they find themselves in an ancient tomb. Jewels are embedded in the walls. Coins are heaped on tables, spilling onto the floor. In some versions of the story, guardians patrol the tomb, spirits of stone and metal. In others, there are deadly traps. But one detail remains the same throughout all the tales: treasures taken from the tomb always bring misfortune, bestowing curses that linger until the thief finds the tomb again and returns what they have stolen... or until they die."

If this is the case, is the character welcome to one day return to Thelanis, or were they cast out of it? Did the Lady in Shadow encourage her child to leave, or did the adventurer escape from the maze of thorns where they were held prisoner (for their own good, of course)? Does the character have a fey lover or rival in Thelanis? With the DM's permission, such a changeling--of any race--could replace their background feature with the Fey Nature feature provided in the sidebar."

								"At least, that's the popular opinion--but it's not entirely true. The plane's title, \"Realm of Madness,\" is a label applied by the people of Eberron based on the perception that close interaction with Xoriat can interfere with your ability to process reality. But illithids call Xoriat the Realm of Revelations... and this may be more accurate. Where Lamannia embodies the natural world, Xoriat instead embodies the unnatural. It's a window into the workings of reality that mortals normally don't see, ones they're ill-equipped to handle. It suggests that time and space, order and chaos, war and peace--all of these are inventions. They're the foundations mortal lives are built on... but what lies under those foundations? What was there before the house was built, and what will come after? Xoriat holds the answers to those questions, and infinitely more as well.",
								"Though the fact is often overlooked, all mortals have a connection to Xoriat. Mortals dream in Dal Quor. Shavarath sparks mortal anger. Mabar feeds mortal shadows, while Irian holds their spark of light. When mortals die, their souls are drawn to Dolurrh. Mortals are influenced by all of the planes, and the influence of Xoriat drives the desire to question reality. It can be a source of inspiration, especially for artists; it helps people challenge their assumptions and see things in an entirely new way. But Xoriat's also the sun that melts the wings of any who draw too close. From a distance, its influence can be a positive force, but mortals who gaze too deeply into Xoriat can lose touch with their native reality, losing the ability to navigate the natural world. So Xoriat is a deeply dangerous place, but the plane itself isn't evil or destructive. It's part of the universal balance, as important as any of the other concepts of the planes. Irian brings life, Lamannia is the blueprint for nature, Daanvi provides guiding order. Xoriat is a glimpse at what lies behind and beyond, of the other ways reality could have been--and of the unseen ways it {@i is}.",

												"Imagine time as a maze and the Material Plane as a rat moving through it, with the other planes worn as a crown. This is how the Draconic Prophecy works. It doesn't tell you what will happen, because that hasn't been decided yet. It's a roadmap to the maze, revealing that if you take a left turn at \"Queen Aurala is assassinated\" and then turn right at \"Breland becomes a democracy,\" you'll reach \"Sul Khatesh is released from her prison.\" The Prophecy shows the path you need to take to achieve the outcome you desire--a map to the many possibilities of the future.",
												"But Xoriat isn't bound to the rat. It hovers above the maze. And adventurers could return to the wrong time when they leave it, falling farther back in the maze. They could find themselves in the Empire of Dhakaan, or in the midst of the War of the Mark. And in the process, they could change the future. Perhaps they help Halas Tarkanan win the War of the Mark; the dragonmarked houses are broken and scattered before they ever achieve their current glory, and people with aberrant dragonmarks thrive. With these changes, modern Khorvaire would be a very different place. In doing this, the adventurers have dropped a new rat in the maze. This new rat becomes the Prime Material Plane. It snatches the old rat's crown of planes, becoming the reality where all the planes converge and where time moves forward. But the other rat is still out there--forgotten and lost, huddled in a corner, but still alive. And it's possible that if the adventurers return to Xoriat, they could change their mind; they could find their way back to that original rat, returning it to its role as the Prime Material Plane. So Xoriat gives the possibility for dramatic change--but it's always possible to restore a forgotten past.",
												"This view is critical to understanding the daelkyr. They stand above the maze, but they can also descend into it. They experiment on the rat, changing it. What happens if they make too many changes? It's possible the rat might crawl into a corner to die and a new rat be released: perhaps the old Prime is lost and a new world moves forward. This is what the gith believe happened with their world, as described in the section on Kythri. The gith lived on a world that was once the Prime Material Plane. Now it may just be another rat lost and forgotten in the maze. Should the daelkyr rise and complete their work, it's possible the current Eberron could be torn away from the planes; it would still exist, but as a forgotten shadow of the new central reality that takes its place.",
												"If this doesn't entirely make sense, that's appropriate. Most scholars in Khorvaire would call this theory madness, and so Xoriat receives its name. But others might say that this is in keeping with the myth of the Progenitors. Irian is the beginning, Mabar is the end--and Xoriat could be the point that stands above the journey, the high perch from which the Progenitors could study their work. Xoriat isn't bound by the laws that bind the rest of the planes, and it holds all the ideas that were discarded. Perhaps the Sovereigns didn't entirely build reality, but rather, they {@i sculpted} it--chipping things away and dropping them into Xoriat.",
												"This is a metaphysical discussion that most adventurers will never need to worry about. There are three things to take away from it. Xoriat is a point from which history and reality itself can be changed. The daelkyr have changed it an unknown number of times. And from Xoriat, it's possible for adventurers to either change it themselves--or to undo damage they might have done."

Dyrrn the Corruptor, Valaara, Belashyrra--each dwells in a domain in Xoriat, attended by their servants and their armies. This ties to Xoriat's uncanny relationship with time. The daelkyr may be in Xoriat because they haven't left yet, or they might've already been released from their prisons and returned to Xoriat. Again, if time is a maze, the daelkyr stand above it looking down--but at the same time, they are also running in the maze. They can't return to Eberron now, because they're already there; but this may be why they seem unconcerned with their long imprisonment, because they're also watching it all unfold from above. So adventurers could interact with any of the daelkyr in Xoriat, but fighting them there won't impact their actions on Eberron.

										"Much of the influence of the dragonmarked houses is based on a simple principle: it's easier to amplify an existing magical effect, such as that of a dragonmark, than to create the same effect from nothing. Taken on their own, the powers granted by dragonmarks aren't overwhelmingly powerful. However, over the course of centuries, House Cannith and the Twelve have developed items that focus and enhance the powers of the mark to produce powerful, reliable effects. In many cases--such as the {@i storm spires} of House Lyrandar and the {@i creation forges} of House Cannith--the Arcane Congress has been unable to duplicate the effects of these powerful focus items for non-dragonmarked creatures. Other items have since been reproduced in forms that anyone can use, but an item that requires the user to possess a specific dragonmark is always easier to create and less expensive than one that produces the same effect for anyone, giving the dragonmarked houses an important advantage.",

In addition, you could have a dragonmark focus item that produces the same effect as an existing magic item from the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|ERLW}--except it can't be used or attuned unless you possess a particular dragonmark. House Lyrandar is working on a version of a {@item broom of flying} for dragonmarked heirs, though they haven't perfected it yet. House Ghallanda is developing a {@i portable inn}--a version of the {@item Daern's Instant Fortress||instant fortress}--but it's proven difficult. It's always up to the DM to decide if there's a dragonmark focus item that replicates the effects of any given magic item, and if so, how readily it's available.",
										"The {@table Dragonmark Focus Items|ExploringEberron} table provides examples of focus items, along with the item whose effects they reproduce and the mark required to use or attune to the focus item. A focus item's rarity is generally less than a similar item that anyone can use, reflecting the relative ease of manufacture. However, this doesn't mean they are readily available; dragonmark focus items are rarely sold in stores. They can only be created using proprietary tools, and are produced exclusively by House Cannith and the Twelve for use by trusted agents of the dragonmarked houses. So while many Medani inquisitives wear {@item Eyes of minute seeing||Medi spectacles}, they acquired them through service to the house, not by purchasing them with gold.",
										"While a dragonmark focus item usually has the same general appearance as the item whose effects it duplicates, it bears the image of the required mark somewhere on the item, and often carries the sigil of the associated house. Siberys dragonshards are a vital component of focus items, most including a shard in some form.

Beyond this, its appearance reflects its theme blended with its alien nature; for example, Valaara typically appears as an angelic humanoid merged with insect elements. But after people encounter a daelkyr, those who compare notes may find they disagree on the details. The daelkyr might appear as someone the viewer knows, or its appearance could shift mid-conversation. This is not something the daelkyr controls, and it's not considered a beneficial trait; it's simply part of their alien nature.",

A daelkyr can communicate with any number of creatures within range at once, projecting a thought much as other creatures project sound. Typically when a daelkyr \"speaks,\" all creatures receive the same message, but the DM might decide that one or more creatures receive a different message. And just as people see different things when they look at a daelkyr, two people can perceive a daelkyr's \"speech\" in very different ways. One may feel as though the daelkyr is speaking aloud with a strange, alien voice. Another may hear the speech of the daelkyr as the voice of a dead lover, whispering in their ear. Another may not be able to remember actually hearing the daelkyr speak; instead, they just remember its words existing, as if they've always known them.",

Quori are immortal, but they can be slain; when a quori dies, its essence returns to the Dreaming Dark, where it is reconstituted as a new spirit. Quori spirits are bound to emotions, and they feed on those emotions and excel at manipulating them in mortals. The tsucora thrive on fear, the hashalaq manipulate pleasure, the du'ulora are driven by anger, and the kalaraq consume pride and ambition. These are the most common quori, but there are many others; the spiteful tsoreva and the domineering usvapna have already been mentioned in previous editions.",

However, when a quori is reborn, there is a microscopic chance that it will be touched by il-Yannah, the incarnation of light that will one day replace the Dreaming Dark. It's possible for a quori to carry this seed of light and never embrace it. The kalaraq Taratai was the first to rally those quori who could sense the light, teaching them to push back the darkness and embrace il-Yannah. These rebels are the spirits who are now bound to the kalashtar. They are still quori--tsucora, hashalaq, du'ulora, kalaraq--and they are still tied to the emotion associated with their quori type. But they are driven by their vision of the light that is to come rather than the darkness of the present. Taratai's rebels fled Dal Quor long ago, and there have surely been new quori touched by il-Yannah since then. But today, the Dreaming Dark are constantly policing their own ranks and searching for such \"corrupted\" spirits. Any that are found will be destroyed, so their spirits can be reborn as proper servants of il-Lashtavar.",

All of these make them quite different from creatures such as beholders or mind flayers--monsters that are deeply alien, but that are still formed of flesh and blood.",
										"The choice to classify quori as aberrations in fifth edition reflects the idea that \"aberration\" is a broad category including any entity that is fundamentally alien; and certainly, the quori have no place in the natural world. However, this has a number of concrete mechanical effects. Many effects that target evil spirits only affect fiends and undead. As aberrations, quori can't be detected by a paladin's Divine Sense or banished to Dal Quor with {@spell divine word}. The spells {@spell hallow} and {@spell forbiddance} don't protect against them. This was an intentional decision that renders quori immune to many of the tools that can be deployed against devils or demons. However, as a DM, you can choose to make quori fiends instead of aberrations if you want these spells and effects to be effective against them. Or you could compromise by leaving quori as aberrations, but say that clerics and paladins devoted to the Path of Light can affect quori with any spell or class feature that affects fiends. This keeps quori as mysterious and alien, and gives the Path of Light a unique role in battling them."

I want to build a fortress and wield a blade of steel.\" The Queen replied, \"Then leave the wood, but do not bring your metal into my domain.\" And so he left the wood and founded the kingdom of Karrnath. The next day the eldest daughter came before the Queen. \"Mother, I dream of magic! I want to build a tower and conjure fire!\" The Queen replied, \"Then leave the wood, but do not cast your spells in my domain.\" And so she left the wood and founded the kingdom of Thaliost. One by one, the Queen's children left her, until she was alone in the woods with the spirits and the beasts. And as each child raised a kingdom, the woods grew smaller and farther apart, and the heart of the Forest Queen grew bitter and cold. The people are her great-grandchildren, and she will not harm those who stay on the path and respect the beasts of the forest.

Such forests typically have well-worn paths that avoid these pitfalls, thus strengthening the story of stay on the path. The Greensinger druids know rituals to connect a forest to the Endless Weald, establishing a temporary manifest zone in any deep wood. The Queen's influence can also be felt in any forest in times when Eberron and Thelanis are coterminous. Just like the stories, the Queen's personality often reflects the forest where she's currently manifesting; the Forest Queen is more likely to be benevolent in the Twilight Demesne and cruel in the Nightwood."

Beyond the forest, an agent could be tasked to recover a relic stolen from the Endless Weald (and once reclaimed, perhaps entrusted to carry this artifact on their adventures). Agents of the Forest Queen might be charged to act as envoys, negotiating with agents of other archfey or dealing with the Feyspires. Or perhaps there's a darkness in the Endless Weald, a canker that appeared when the forests of Cyre were consumed by the Mourning.

A character could also earn her ire by taking one of her relics from a forest, perhaps not knowing that the magic item is tied to the wood. On a larger scale, the Forest Queen could grow tired of civilization itself. The forests containing her manifest zones could expand, with fey and feral beasts attacking villages and towns as they're overgrown.

This exceptionally dense wood can be used to fashion armor without metal, which could use the same statistics as any medium or heavy armor. Arrows and crowssbow bolts can also be fashioned from {@i bronzewood}, and this exceptionally durable ammunition breaks no more often than its steel counterpart. Similarly, {@i leafweave} armor is made from alchemically treated leaves of the bronzewood tree, and can offer the same level of protection as studded leather or a chain shirt.",

Another option is a weapon formed from the bones of a monstrosity; here again, the principle is that the weapon is mechanically identical to a standard weapon, but doesn't violate the Forest Queen's ban on metal. If a character is using a bone weapon, there should certainly be a story to it: What creature is it from? Who killed the beast and shaped the weapon, and how did the character come by it?"

Even when he saved the kingdom from a cruel dragon, the people assumed one of his brothers had done the deed. But in that dragon's lair, the prince discovered a strange sack. Reaching inside it, he found a toy he'd loved as a child and long forgotten about, a comb lost by his sister, and a map of a nation that no longer exists. Curious, he climbed into the sack and found a castle within it, filled with forgotten wonders. No one ever noticed he was gone, and no one remembers his name or his deeds. But the Forgotten Prince still dwells in his Castle of Lost Things. When you forget something you love, or when something you need is nowhere to be found, it's because the Forgotten Prince has taken it for his hoard."

Often such thefts are never noticed, but he might take things that are quite valuable if he believes them to be unloved or unappreciated by those who have them. Sometimes this is done to teach a lesson, how the loss of a simple and undervalued item or idea can have disastrous consequences.

The Prince may also task agents with actions to expose or bring down people whose reputations are undeserved, or to assist those who are unappreciated.

					"To date, no one knows the origin or purpose--if any--of the ruinbound dwarves. Doldarun asserts that they are children corrupted by Dyrrn in the womb, tools of the daelkyr waiting to be activated. The sages of Clan Narathun say that they may indeed be the result of strange forces emanating from the Realm Below, but there's no evidence that the children have any direct tie to the daelkyr or that they're drawn to malefic actions. Regardless of the truth, ruinbound dwarves are a recent development. The first ruinbound children were born thirty years ago, and traditionally, dwarves aren't even considered to be adults until their fiftieth year; however, ruinbound children mature surprisingly (some say unnaturally) quickly.",
					"Ruinbound dwarves are quite rare and can be born to dwarves of any bloodline. The Mror still don't know what to make of them, though their attitude toward symbionts generally mirrors that toward ruinbound dwarves. The Doldarun dwarves are hostile to any ruinbounds that come to their land, and claim that ruinbound children are never born in their clan; while that's a possibility, there are also rumors of Soldorak agents among the Doldarun that spirit away these infants to a clan that celebrates them, lest they meet a darker fate. The Droranath and Toldorath clans are curious, but they won't necessarily ostracize ruinbound dwarves. Soldorak and Narathun families might embrace a ruinbound child--but they also might reject them out of fear that other clans could use them to paint the entire family as corrupted. In creating a ruinbound character, you need to decide how you were received, reflected by your background. Are you an urchin or an outlander, having made your own way after being rejected by your family? Are you a charlatan or a criminal, forced down a dangerous path by the fears of those around you? Or might you be a noble, treasured by your family despite--or because of--your condition?",
					"As a ruinbound dwarf, you could also choose to attribute your class abilities to your symbiont or your unnatural nature. As a sorcerer, your spellcasting could be channeled through your symbiont or other mutations. Any class with Unarmored Defense could present it as being tied to a physical mutation; if you're a barbarian, your rage could manifest as an active transformation. If you're a ruinbound warlock, you could say that your symbiont is your patron, an active sentience within you--and if you help it grow, it promises you greater powers.",
					"While others might fear them, ruinbound dwarves aren't innately evil. In creating a ruinbound character, talk with your DM about where you'd like your story to go. Do you want to be faced with the threat of corruption? Is it possible that Dyrrn does have plans for you? Or do you want to be a true hero despite your seemingly sinister features?"

This allows you to convey a short message--a concept that can be expressed in six words or less--to anyone who knows the language and who can see you. Typically the message is something you maintain as part of your appearance; for example, in crafting your image, you might add a pattern of scars that tells other changeling travelers, 'I need help' or 'Everything I say is a lie.'",

The shifting patterns can be noticed by other observers within 60 feet; if you wish to keep the conversation discrete, you can hide it with a Charisma ({@skill Deception}) check opposed by the observer's Wisdom ({@skill Perception} or {@skill Insight}) check. If you fail, it means the observer notices your shifting patterns, though they don't understand the meaning unless they also know skin cant."
