However, the true monsters of this land are found in the degenerating cities of old, where humanity clings to survival. While nefarious figures entice those who seek power, the devotees of dead gods punish the impious. There are few heroes in a world as morally corrupted as this. The only hope in Etharis is that which you bring, yourself.",

The blood, bones, brains, and bile of the creatures they kill might provide characters advantages later. Weapons, potions, components, and other magic items might not be readily available, but the characters can make their own from salvaged parts of monsters.

A small tribe of nine faevlin are spread out across the Bone House. One is assisting the bone trader with its work. Two are moving supplies into the ruined cabin. Two more are searching the refuse pit for trinkets and gold.

The only light sources at night are the cooking fire in the faevlin camp and the braziers (kept burning constantly) in the bone manse. Otherwise, the forest and cavern are dark. Characters observing the scene see the faevlin eventually swap places or jobs, but other than the day-night crew change, the faevlin always divide into work crews.",

Captured characters unwilling or unable to make a deal may find themselves fed on, one at a time, over the next few days. Escape is always possible, of course!",

The temple's remote location proves perfect for the Holy One's efforts. Its followers have constructed makeshift storehouses, barracks, and even special chambers for the Holy One itself.",

Trees and plants have begun to wither, and docile animals have fled the area in droves, driven away by the persistent darkness. The characters have either been hired to determine the source of this darkness and restore the light, or have undertaken this quest on their own."

								"In Stehlenwald province, the small city of Flamegrit is an iron mine that has a problem with elementals. Mjorks have been moving up through the lower levels of the mine, and now they've taken over. The dwarves have sealed off the mine, but they know it won't hold the mjorks forever: the mjorks seek to escape the mine's confines and spread their environment of ash and fire to the whole of Etharis.",

										"The easiest way for the characters to be involved is to be in Flamegrit when the mine is sealed; the dwarven council recruits them to clear the top level of the mine and rescue miners trapped there. Perhaps the dwarves have a magic item or resource the characters need, or perhaps the dwarven council's permission is needed to travel through their lands or to explore. Whatever the characters need, the dwarves have it and will give it to the characters if they defeat the mjorks who have shut down their mine.",
										"If you remove the miner-survivors ({@area area 4|176|x}), it's also possible for the characters to stumble into the mine unwittingly while exploring a dungeon or other subterranean complex (though they have less of a reason to fight through the mjorks in this case). Just age the equipment and give the mine the feel of being abandoned rather than recently used\u2014perhaps block off the area beyond the double doors in {@area area 1|16a|x} with a cave-in and have the characters enter from somewhere else."

								"The mine is hot. While rocky surfaces won't cause damage, it is exceptionally warm, like the inside of a sauna. Prolonged exposure without a buffer or cooler causes characters to accrue levels of {@condition exhaustion} at a rate of one level per eight hours. The air is stale and sooty, even in areas lacking mjorks. The northern area of the cavern is largely static, but if the characters delay too long in {@area area 2|16e|x}, two {@creature Mjork Sootling Swarm|GrimHollowLairsEtharis|sootling swarms}* climb from the pit and harass them. The {@creature mjork charger|GrimHollowLairsEtharis}* in {@area area 7|184|x} is on patrol across the southern area. Exceptionally loud noise (as from a {@spell thunderwave} or {@spell knock} spell) draws the charger to almost any location in the mine in {@dice 2d4} rounds.",

The ilharans have taken great pains to make sure that the roost is safe\u2014even from curious members of their own sect\u2014and are awaiting the hatchlings. Wild animals have taken over the nearby ruins, but through long months of confrontation, the ilharans stay out of the ruins and the beasts don't venture into the ilharans' sanctuary.",

										"The ilharans' plans are at odds with civilized society: hungry ithjar (both regular and stormborn) have been raiding roads and farms for decades, but lately they've grown bolder, wiping out villages and even attacking fortified settlements and castles. The characters have been hired by the governor or regent of the region to find the ithjar lair and wipe out the threat. Diviners have tracked the ithjar to the Storm Sanctuary, and now the characters must take them on. Alternatively, the characters may need an ithjar egg for a ritual, craft, or contract. Their efforts to locate an egg ultimately lead them to the Storm Sanctuary."

Called Astranag, the holy shrine was a place of learning, focused on uncovering natural wonders and divining fate from the stars. After the God's End, the clear and fertile land about Astranag sank into more, and what was bright became foul. The burgeoning swamp swallowed most of the temple, and thick mists closed off the stars from sight. The place of clarity became obscured and forgotten by most until it was put to darker purpose.",

For decades, the ordeal tree has rested atop one of the few hills that rise out of the swamp, feasting on the foolish and granting power to those of the darkest hearts. The latest, a dark werebear known as Folmar Duskscape, has camped in the ruins. Folmar seeks to gain more and more power from the ordeal tree, but the tree taunts him. It granted him power once, but despite surviving the ordeal three times, his further pleas have gone unanswered. Folmar is systematically seeking loopholes in the mystical bargain.",

A few weeks ago, two-thirds of the tribe was eaten the first day the pair woke, but that didn't stop the kobolds. The tribe brought more offerings, capturing wild game, farmers, and livestock to appease the lindwyrm pair which, with their hunger sated, began to tolerate the kobolds. Other than a few raids of their own against nearby villages or farms, the lindwyrms have turned their attention toward their hatching eggs.

Krumm found abandoned lodgings upon which to build his new home, including a small manor and a house for servants. Within a month, Krumm and his followers had created a well for water, a garden for food, abundant game for meat, and Krumm knew privacy like they never had before.",

								"Jacoty Endak traveled the length and breadth of Etharis. He sang songs, told tales, collected stories, and survived countless adventures. Jacoty thought he'd seen and experienced everything, until he fell madly in love with a chef named Hosken Kwilleau. The two moved to a remote region of the Castellan Province to live out their lives together, sharing their love with each other and those around them.",

Jacoty did everything in his immense power to find his lost love, but it was all for naught. Jacoty spent the rest of his life pining for Hosken, wracked with guilt and anger. When Jacoty finally died of wasting grief, even that passing failed to reunite him with his love. Jacoty was reborn as an hourglass widow.",
								"As an undead creature that despises hope, Jacoty moves throughout the countryside, snuffing out hope and joy wherever he finds it. He's recently found an opportunity to corrupt the hopes and dreams of a werebear ascetic named Zeragonia. Zeragonia found this region suffused with lycanthropy after a visit from the Great Beast, and she established a cave complex to harbor lycanthropes trying to learn to control their affliction. An acolyte of Miklas, Zeragonia calls upon that Arch Seraph's power to aide her in healing her charges, or at least helping them control themselves.",
								"When Jacoty learned of Zeragonia's ministrations, he found a new focus for his evil intentions. He wormed his way into Zeragonia's cavern-home, and he is using his powers to subvert Zeragonia and corrupt her followers. He's already taken control of the lair and of those whom the werebear attempted to help, and he's almost completed the process of turning Zeragonia herself to the side of darkness.",

When the vampire was at the height of her power, an angel of Empyreus named Benitent swooped in and captured her. It dragged the powerful undead creature to a remote prison, far from any civilized areas that she might threaten.",
								"Unable to kill Aeilidrania permanently and fearing she would simply escape if he destroyed her current form, Benitent secured the vampire in a magical dwelling on an island surrounded by an abjuration-powered moat. The vampire's many followers have scoured the world, looking for a way to rescue their absent master, but only a few have managed to find this area. They cannot, however, breach the moat and the bridge, so they hurl themselves ineffectively at the barrier, all the while trying to think of other ways to free their mistress.",
								"Benitent is only able to keep this prison intact through the power of a mortal being. Fearing that bringing any living creature into the prison area might give the vampire someone to manipulate, the angel of Empyreus employed a blind and deaf caretaker named Habret to live on the island, taking care of pigs and living in a small house.",
								"For her part, Aeilidrania has given up attempting to escape. She's formed a friendship with the old caretaker, sharing with him much of the knowledge and wisdom she's gathered across the many centuries of her unlife. She also has enacted plans to corrupt Benitent, tricking the single-focused angel of Empyreus into unconsciously doing her bidding even while she remains its prisoner.",

Whether or not they learn of the vampire's imprisonment by Benitent, the angel of Empyreus, depends on how much research they undertake and how many resources they use. With no other means of securing the information they need to deal with the incredible threat, the characters are forced to seek out Aeilidrania."
