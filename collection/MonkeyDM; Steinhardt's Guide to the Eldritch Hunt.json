While the denizens of the town struggled against insurmountable odds, the church and the nobility didn't remain inert, instead concentrating their efforts to engineer the ideal weapon, something capable of annihilating the beasts plaguing the city. This weapon came to be known as the jaegers.",

Their reflexes more honed than that of mere mortals, jaegers are capable of dodging the most vicious of blows and using that momentum to drive their blade deep into the heart of their prey. A jaeger's thirst for battle is endless; only in inaction can they experience fatigue. They are the perfect weapon against the nightmarish tides of beasts and the sole reason Luyarnha still stands."

Coming from all walks of life, jaegers blend in with their communities, only unleashing their abilities in times of need. They act as guardians for people who are unable to defend themselves, and they serve as the bloody sword of vengeance in a world that is hell-bent on destroying itself. Life in the city-state of Luyarnha is fraught with peril: gang warfare, infectious madness, and harrowing beasts. Amidst this chaos, jaegers are the first to charge into battle so that their brothers and sisters can survive to live another day.",
								"Jaegers rarely leave their home city of Luyarnha; they would rather die than see it fall to the scourge. Following the jaeger's creed\u2014'survive together, or die together'\u2014they never hunt by themselves unless forced to. The nights can be brutal and the beasts are relentless; against such a ferocious onslaught, only a united front can hope to survive. As a result, jaegers are aware of the importance of teamwork and never charge into battle alone, save to retrieve fallen allies. The bonds formed during the hunts are stronger than those of many families. Blood is thicker than water, and the gods know that blood is shed when the hunt rages on."

Once, their kin\u2014 demons, dragons, and other creatures of flame and brimstone\u2014roamed freely across the world, but they have long since disappeared, banished from existence by the enigmatic beings that lurk in the glacial void beyond.

This unspeakable atrocity against life twists their flesh and soul, and forces them to carry the remnants of their other half within their chest in the form of a gaping maw, an eye, or some other feature over which they have no control."

Should the trauma not be swiftly attended to, the mother's life can meet an abrupt end. In response, the church has taken to gathering those who exhibit this miraculous conception to ensure their safety during labor and to exert a modicum of control over the potent half-divine progeny.",
						"For some women, particularly those of faith or those deemed unworthy of love, the prospect of receiving this so-called blessing is welcomed. Such a union would grant them sanctuary within the church's protective walls for the remainder of their lives, offering them the semblance of a family they might not have otherwise known, however fractured it may be. Yet, others are repulsed by this fate and seek to defy it, often with tragic results. Those who reject the church's embrace might give birth in forsaken alleyways, casting their children away or consigning them to orphanages. A fortunate few, perhaps bolstered by exceptional financial fortitude or familial support, succeed in bearing their offspring and providing them with as normal a childhood as Luyarnha's grim circumstances allow.",
						"This enigmatic phenomenon has left even the most erudite scholars utterly perplexed. It is widely accepted that the Great Ones are incapable of procreation, and yet. Various theories have been postulated in an attempt to fathom the origins of these peculiar offspring\u2014some conjecture that they serve as beacons, as the Great Ones disseminate their consciousness across the vast reaches of the cosmos, with fragments ultimately embedding themselves within the bodies of these unsuspecting mothers; consequently, the resulting progeny would function as a beacon to draw the Great Ones nearer to the world\u2014others suggest that, due to their intrinsic sterility, the Great Ones crave a surrogate through which to vicariously experience creation. However, the motives of these enigmatic entities are, by their very nature, inscrutable to the mortal mind, and any attempt to decipher their intentions is inherently constrained and flawed."

Moreover, the flowers exude a cloying fragrance, simultaneously repelling ravenous beasts and the cold touch of death. When set alight, the Orphan's Tear can serve as a very durable fuel, only to restore itself in a cycle of rebirth once the flames have been extinguished. Some say that this very capacity to elude the grasp of death is the force that set Carmella upon her unique destiny."

Proficient in the deadly art of the hunt from his former life, Abaddon employs his skills ruthlessly against practitioners of magic. His hunts are no longer mere revenge missions, but have grown into a personal crusade against magic itself. Some spellcasters have taken drastic measures to avoid his wrath, renouncing their powers and severing their ties to the arcane.",

Skeptics, however, opine that his madness is too far gone for any semblance of control to exist. Whether a puppet of the Church or an independent agent of chaos, one thing is agreed upon\u2014being in the path of his monstrous fury is a fate best avoided."

				"Of all beings that relish in the terror they cause, dreadcrows are among the most foul, embodying the worst fears of those who behold them. A dreadcrow's body is illusory, constantly changing and shifting to reflect its victims' deepest fears. Yet it rarely relies on this, instead opting to lie in wait, slowly eroding the minds of those who are unfortunate enough to cross it, driving them to madness. Victims often lose their grip on reality\u2014and life\u2014long before laying their eyes on a dreadcrow. If approached too closely, dreadcrows will retreat in darkness, snuffing any chance of seeing their true form, before assaulting the mind of their prey and plunging them into a smothering abyss of terror.",
				"The success that the once prosperous Luyarnha knew bred complacency and hubris, cardinal sins that no god would leave unpunished. Dreadcrows are said to be born of this divine retaliation, but in stark contrast to their supposed holy origins, dreadcrows are some of the most aberrant creatures to walk the realms. They terrorize, torture, and torment all, with a sinister preference for the defenseless\u2014newborns or the elderly."

Its jaws, lined with razor-sharp teeth, click and snap with a rhythmic hunger that speaks of its insatiable appetite for flesh. Its claws, long and curved like sickles, are stained with the blood of countless victims, and its very presence seems to warp reality around it, plunging the world into a nightmare of darkness and chaos where light will be snuffed out.",

The twisted child was both divine and corrupted, and cursed by its very existence. The godling was quickly discarded by The Whispering Darkness and left to die in the Frozen Wraithlands, a frozen hellscape reflecting the eternal winter that Lirwen's curse brought upon humanity. The child, mired in madness and despair, mourned the loss of its mother, and its eldritch-infused screams spread pain and suffering throughout the Frozen Wraithlands.",

								"When the first acolytes of the Obitus Scholare cried out to the heavens in search of answers, a being of light came to them in their dreams. The being promised them answers to their prayers and beckoned them deep underground to a place of power. As they struggled through the darkness, the acolytes found a being of pure light and fell to their knees to bask in its splendor. They built their temple secretly, learning from the \"Radiant One\" and establishing a church in his name. They did not know that this being was not their god\u2014he was the God-Shaped Hole, a powerful eldritch entity pretending to be their dead deity.",

When they begged him for salvation from the Southern armies, the \"Radiant One\" sent even more creatures to them in trials by combat.",

With this power, the church grew in strength and numbers, coming to dominate the First War. But the eldritch gods soon took notice and corrupted those that bore eldritch power in their veins, transforming them into twisted creatures cursed with madness.",
								"And so the Obitus Scholare cried out to their god once more for answers. The God-Shaped Hole responded with yet more blood and darkness. Before their eyes, he took their leader with his power, twisting his body and tearing it apart to form His word carved into the temple floor. He taught the acolytes to inscribe these Eldritch Carvings into their flesh to grant them new powers. He left the leader in the temple stones, where he continues to suffer eternal agony.",

Soon after, the God-Shaped Hole disappeared, and the church was left in darkness once more. New eldritch creatures, born of twisted flesh and dark experiments, emerged in the underground temple.",

The moon reigns eternal over a terrified populace, and even the smallest creatures pose a deadly threat.

Luyarnha isn't an ordinary city; it is a torture chamber where each citizen simply waits in line to meet a horrific end.",

In fear of these spectral terrors, the residents barricade their windows and douse their doors with holy water, hiding away and hoping the ghostly horde dissipates with the dawn.

The First War} {@homebrew |(page 9)}, the city of Luyarnha has been a shining beacon of civilization, its rulers dedicated to fostering peace, prosperity, and strength for all. Through technological and cultural advances, the city has grown increasingly prosperous. The Radiant Church addresses the spiritual needs of citizens, while the benevolent nobility takes care of their material necessities. The Luyarnhian nobility generously supports the clergy, patronizes the arts and music, and donates their wealth to uplift the poor. It is said that the light itself smiles on Luyarnha.",
								"It takes only a closer look to see the cracks in that shining facade. There is a taint lying beneath the city's surface, a corruption that has rotted its soul. Luyarnhian nobles hide behind false kindness and charity, using the citizens as nothing more than pawns in their twisted machinations. Occult factions of the Radiant Church work in the shadows, experimenting with dark forces beyond their understanding. The city has rotted from the inside through their combined greed and lust for power.",
								"A small sect of the Radiant Church\u2014the Obitus Scholare\u2014recently smuggled the remains of an ancient eldritch creature into the city for experimentation, hiding it in the once-thriving area known as the Ruby District. They discovered a way to augment their bodies, cure diseases, and even extend their lives by alchemically processing the creature's fluids and flesh. A handful of nobles unwittingly funded the secret research to access the sect's eldritch-augmented assassin, oblivious to the grotesque methods being used. And while the nobles gleefully murdered rivals to enrich themselves further, the sect harvested the corpse, developed a tonic they claimed could cure any disease, and gave it to the church healers.",
								"They did not realize the magnitude of the forces at play, nor did they know their assassin was weakening and would betray them. The eldritch being's remains began twisting the fabric of reality, causing the moon to appear on fire and emanating a maddening aura throughout the Ruby District. As the madness flowed through his mind and body, the augmented assassin killed sect members to take the husk's power all for himself.",
								"The resulting sickness spread like wildfire, transforming its victims into twisted creatures filled with rage and madness. In an attempt to impede the propagation of the scourge, the Ruby District, where the infection hit the hardest, was isolated. Citizens now cry for help and accuse the nobility of dabbling in dark arts as the church continues distributing their tonic, unwittingly spreading the madness further. The city's inner rot has finally seeped through the cracks as Luyarnha sinks further into darkness and despair."

The Obitus Scholare could use their remaining hunters to eliminate many of the creatures, but there were simply too many. To erase all traces of their work and stop the monsters from attacking the city above, the priests arranged for a massive flood of an acid-like fluid designed to eat flesh and organic matter to wash through Jägerweiler, killing both monsters and villagers in the process. The priests, eager to leave Jägerweiler behind them, slunk away to continue their secret experiments in the insane asylum beneath the Grand Cathedral, creating more powerful hunters with their refined techniques. With Luyarnha currently under the effects of madness-inducing moons, they can act with apparent impunity as the city looks further inward and descends into chaos.",

										"Half a millennium past, Luyarnha was nothing but a humble settlement. Sprouted from a tentative alliance of humans and elves, it was a unique circumstance in an era of separation and discord.",
										"For a time, the land on which it lay was a battleground, a coveted prize for both species. Neither human nor elven armies could claim true victory. Until, from the ashes of ceaseless conflict, rose an idea: united, they could reach heights unattainable alone. And thus, Luyarnha emerged\u2014a sanctuary at the frontier of two worlds. Humanity claimed the east, and the elven empire took the west, their destinies interwoven below the frozen reaches of the north. To the south lay an uncharted wilderness, teeming with untamed, fearsome beasts that deterred even the bravest of explorers.",
										"This exchange of ideas proved to be incredibly positive. Elven sagacity was fused with human tenacity; the wisdom of long-lived beings blended with the vigorous dynamism of mankind, launching Luyarnha into an era of prosperity. Where elves had the sharpness necessary to make competent decisions, humans' capability to reproduce, superior physical strength, and inherent drive to succeed made them prime explorers and laborers, capable of throwing bodies at a problem until it was solved.",
										"Thus the Luyarnhian province brought forth a verdant renaissance of agriculture. Fields bloomed in abundance, providing sustenance aplenty for the burgeoning populace. It was an arrangement symbiotic in nature, a ballet of cooperation.",
										"In this era, Luyarnha, governed by representatives from both races, was bestowed the crown of independence, but it was in name only. The city remained an infant, dependent on the support of its parent kingdoms to bloom into its destined grandeur, still bending to their whims to receive what was necessary for its growth."

										"The nascent town sprouted rapidly, its own distinct identity blossoming from the fertile soil of its mixed heritage. A shared tapestry of traditions and cultures that was neither wholly elven nor human, but uniquely Luyarnhian. A sense of self-rule began to stir in the hearts of its people, kindling a desire for complete autonomy.",
										"And so, the negotiation for independence unfurled. The strategic position of the town, nestled between the two colossal empires, forestalled any attempt at invasion from either side. Eventually, Luyarnha emerged victorious in its negotiation, its sovereignty acknowledged by the birth of a new regent appointed by both sides: the Silverblood baron\u2014a half-elf that shared both the elven and human roots of the town. Though this title was but a symbolic veneer, it served to establish Luyarnha as a sovereign city-state in the eyes of its inhabitants.",
										"The journey was not without turbulence. Conflicts erupted, dissenters voiced their grievances, but the success of the venture drowned out the noise. The richness of a shared culture, a unity of purpose, catapulted Luyarnha into an epoch of unparalleled wealth. Nestled at the crossroads of naval and terrestrial trade routes, it burgeoned into a bustling hub of commerce and prosperity."

								"Several decades of tranquility blessed the city-state of Luyarnha, nestled as it was within the protective embrace of two formidable empires. Each kingdom had its fate intertwined with the city, leading to a vested interest in preserving its prosperity. And so, the city-state blossomed, its roots deepening in the fertile soil of commerce, trading expansively with its neighbors and within its own borders. However, the southern frontier posed a constant threat, its hostile ambitions resulting in numerous bids to conquer Luyarnha. This imminent danger birthed a mighty southern wall, which in time evolved into a fortress encircling the city-state.",

										"Yet, amid this progress, an unforeseen issue began to rear its ugly head. Luyarnha's charm lay in its cultural diversity, a wealth of varied belief systems cohabiting within its borders, diversity that was further amplified by the arrivals of orcs and their traditions. However, this vibrancy soon turned into a curse. Tensions simmered, clashes occurred, and tribes formed within the city, each viewing the other through lenses of suspicion. This tribalization stalled Luyarnha's growth and influenced all spheres of life, including the justice system.",
										"Within the city's courtrooms, the cultural dissonance became glaringly obvious. Diverse perspectives on justice clashed relentlessly. The more austere cultures clamored for capital punishment for certain crimes, while others advocated for redemption and forgiveness. Reaching a consensus seemed an insurmountable task, leading to each 'tribe' taking matters into their own hands and deciding their own form of justice.",
										"Such discord was the antithesis of unity. The fractures within Luyarnha's society grew deeper, with the once unified nation showing signs of fragmentation. The Silverblood queen of the time, in an effort to quell the unrest, sought to weave a cultural fabric that could embrace the myriad hues of its people. Alas, the threads snapped, and the initiative fell flat. The attempt to impose a homogenous culture on a city of diverse traditions and beliefs proved futile."

										"In the midst of such tumult, a fresh heir emerged from the revered Silverblood lineage. Upon his mother's demise, he ascended the throne, inheriting the title of the King of Luyarnha. This young ruler, Reinholdt \"The Yellow\" Silverblood\u2014always adorned in his family's yellow garb\u2014remained indifferent to the moral dilemmas plaguing his subjects. He envisioned a singular path towards unity and was willing to pay the high price it demanded; he worked relentlessly to achieve this goal throughout the 66 years of his reign.",
										"Reinholdt embarked on his reign by centralizing laws, consolidating military power, and dealing sternly with any who sought to undermine his authority. This increasing concentration of power was leveraged for personal gain, akin to feudal practices, and many were concerned by his decisions. He perceived these as necessary sacrifices for the attainment of his grand future.",
										"As the government grew more centralized, it executed a radical plan\u2014banning all religions within the state\u2014 earning Reinholdt the moniker of Godless King. Thus began a period of ruthless prosecution of those who held on to their 'worthless gods'. Simultaneously, a vast indoctrination program was set into motion, imposing upon citizens the learning of songs and propaganda glorifying the government. These were mandated across all educational institutions and public spaces. This shift from a religiously diverse society to a godless one was expedited due to the dwindling display of divine power. The ancient tales of gods and their miracles paled in comparison to the modern advancements brought forth by mortals. All of Luyarnha was to bend the knee to the Silverblood rule, lest it be met with a red wave of blood.",
										"Convinced by his own propaganda, the Godless King began to perceive himself as a god\u2014he who was driven by grand visions and possessed the voice of creation. It seemed only righteous, then, for him to make decisions that would sculpt the nation's future. He declared himself the only God worthy of worship, outlawing all other religions. In his pursuit of unity, he imprisoned and executed thousands, targeting believers and political adversaries alike. The diverse cultural landscape was crushed beneath the weight of the state, and Luyarnha was brought under the singular banner of the Godless King, invoking both fear and reverence. Days were dedicated to his worship, songs composed in his honor, and history books were revised to glorify his reign. However, he harbored an appreciation for religious architecture, and spared most religious structures, as they were a source of pride for the city.",
										"The Godless King nurtured ambitions of global dominance for his lineage. He diverted substantial resources towards military development and weaponry, whilst systematically eradicating beliefs in anything other than the state. During his reign, Luyarnha's military prowess saw a significant boost, particularly as the Elven Enclave in the west grappled with its internal conflicts. Seeing an opportunity, he instituted a compulsory draft to amplify Luyarnha's military, establishing extensive military infrastructure and compelling the populace to serve, with the threat of incarceration looming over dissenters. This coercive measure soon became routine, leading to a mostly voluntary military force.",
										"Concurrently, the human empire was obliterated, seemingly overnight, leaving only ashes in its wake and no survivors to explain the sudden vanishing of an entire nation. Fearful of the fate that befell the humans\u2014and perhaps aware of the cause of their fate\u2014the Godless King rerouted most of the country's finances towards plans of war. As the Elven Enclave weakened and internal conflicts rose, the Godless King, apprehensive that the force that annihilated the humans might turn towards him, hastened his invasion plans. This fear, however, was to prove his undoing."

										"In a grave miscalculation, the Godless King's public proclamation of his intent to conquer the Elven Enclave, ill-mixed with the grievous mishandling of the public's perception, kindled the spark of dissent that marked the onset of his downfall.",
										"The people of Luyarnha bore the suffering under the regime, lured by the allure of a brighter future. Yet, the moment they realized this future was founded on the impending subjugation of the elven realm, a realm many still held in high regard due to shared ancestry, resentment began to seep in. Elves, after all, are the keepers of deep-rooted memories, and the state's recent\u2014by elven reckoning\u2014propagandistic endeavors could not extinguish these ties. The fact that Luyarnha was a city more accustomed to the clatter of trade than the clang of swords further intensified the resistance against sending their offspring to a war that wasn't theirs to fight. This sentiment resonated most profoundly amongst the orcish populace who had watched too many of their kin fall in the clan wars of old, before finding refuge within Luyarnha's walls.",
										"This led to civil unrest, which was furthered by the Radiant Church; what was once a niche sect was given room to proliferate when all other religions had to bend the knee. Indeed, followers of the Radiant One stood strong in their belief and would keep showing faith even on the gallows. Such conviction moved many to join their cause. Thus, many military leaders\u2014those who were charged with maintaining the peace\u2014began to turn their back on the aristocracy, driven not only by newfound faith, but also by the tantalizing allure of the Church's promises of riches and prosperity.",
										"This tension ignited a bloody and brutal civil war.",
										"The civil war tore through the city for months on end, cleaving through the once resplendent Spired District. The arcane arts, a rare and coveted gift that coursed through the veins of the king and those of his blood, were ruthlessly wielded. During this violent strife, the citizens were introduced to the dark arts of osteomancy\u2014a malevolent and hitherto unseen magic. Yet, adversity is the mother of invention, and the now powerful Radiant Church found ways to counter these arcane horrors. As the conflict wore on, it became evident that the revolutionary forces would emerge triumphant, the populace rallying to their cause and the once-dreaded royal magic proving unsuccessful against the Church and its adherents.",
										"In the final throes of the civil war, the Church laid siege to the Silverbloods, holed up in their castle and bracing for a last stand they knew they couldn't win. However, unbeknownst to them, betrayal was brewing within their own ranks; the king's brother, in a desperate pact with the Church, agreed to assassinate the king in return for the survival and salvaged prestige of the Silverblood lineage. He carried out his dark promise, plunging a dagger into his brother's heart before the aghast eyes of the revolutionary crowd. The Radiant Church upheld their end of the pact, sparing the remainder of the Silverblood family.",
										"Those who were present during the Godless King's murder heard him talk in an impossible language, laying a curse upon Luyarnha with his last breath. None is sure of what this posthumous act of spite entailed, though some speculate that his objective was to bring ruin upon the city he once ruled, a punishment to the people who betrayed him, in the form of the Scourge.",
										"In the aftermath, chaos swept over Luyarnha. With no clear political path forward, the nation found itself in disarray. The Church assumed an interim governance role, overtaking the Grand Cathedral District, while the surviving Silverbloods, under the watchful eyes of their new overseers, were reluctantly enlisted to aid in restoring order."

								"The Radiant Church's faith holds two fundamental tenets that are integral to their belief. The first is a conviction that true goodness is inextricably linked to strength. Weakness is seen as a vice, a craven display of cowardice rather than a virtue to be upheld. The Radiant clergy expect their followers to be brave, to stand tall in the face of adversity, and to be a beacon of strength for those around them.",
								"This belief in strength is grounded in the understanding that those who are weak act out of fear, rather than a genuine desire to do good. This is not to say that acts of kindness are without merit, but the Radiant Church asserts that the only true benevolence comes from a place of fortitude and resilience. It is a difficult yet powerful philosophy that has led the church to many victories in the past. Leading by example, many of the major figures within the church stand out as giants amongst their fellow citizens, capable of impressive physical displays of power.",
								"The second core belief of the Radiant Church is one of hope for the future. They hold firm to the idea that despite the trials and tribulations of the present, a bright and prosperous tomorrow is within reach. They recognize the immense progress that has been made over the centuries; their lives are far more advanced than their forebears could have ever dreamed. It is the church's duty to ensure continued prosperity, and devout followers are confident that they are the vanguard of a brighter future. Their faith and devotion ensure that progress continues in the years to come, and that none lose the light of hope throughout the world.",

										"Not all the ideas within the Radiant Church are original to them. One such powerful belief that permeates the church is the concept of heaven and hell. Many other religions share these ideas of a guardian at the gate, who upon death determines if ones life was worthy enough to ascend to the higher planes, or if one should descend to the foul planes for an eternity of torture.",
										"The Radiant Faith shares these beliefs, holding to the idea that we are all birthed with light and darkness in our soul, and depending on the deeds we perform, this light shines brighter or darker. The choices we make can either fuel the light or feed the darkness within us. But this principle extends beyond individuals; it's believed that the collective sins of many can push the world towards heaven or hell. With the Scourge currently ravaging the city, there's a growing fear that it's an omen of the city plunging towards hell's icy grasp.",
										"This duality seems embodied within the religion, as all the most righteous saints of the Radiant Church possess eyes of gold. Conversely, those who commit the foulest of sins do not possess darkened eyes, probably due to the fact that once one begins a road filled with sins, the Radiant Faith seems unimportant and is quickly abandoned. Though if one is to meet an individual of darkened iris and sclera, they know better than to approach too close, as sin darkens their heart. Cursed-bloods know of this hatred far too well\u2014they who possess obsidian eyes."

The ruling class, in their hubris, declared the veneration of the divine to be illegal and mandated the substitution of the sacred with a series of ceremonies praising their leader and their flawless government. This edict was inculcated in each household and each school so that none would entertain dangerous ideas. Further compounding this abandonment of faith was the crowning of the Godless King, a man who perceived religion to be a mere distraction for the masses, incompatible with his vision of the future; the state was perfect and eternal, and no mere god would alter that.",

Initially, many dismissed them as yet another group destined to be crushed under the weight of the state doctrine. How wrong they were.",
								"In these years of struggle, Luminara, the faith's leader, faced public execution at the hands of the Godless King himself. Brutally eviscerated, his innards splayed and nailed to the four corners, Luminara was left to die. However, during this savage spectacle, Luminara did not plead nor scream, but prayed to his god for forgiveness. When the King completed his grotesque performance, Luminara wept not for himself, but for the corrupted heart of the King, pitying him even in the face of death\u2014an act that sent the ruler into a bestial frenzy. This public act of defiance bolstered the faith, elevating Luminara to martyrdom and sainthood, and he henceforth became known as the Luminary Prophet.

The conflict culminated in a civil war that the nobility lost, forcing them to kneel as the military forces, abject moralists, and resentful subjects that supported them were slowly supplanted by a more hopeful kin that rejected their tyranny. They were thus compelled to surrender before any further bloodshed could ensue. On that day\u2014 called the Day of Deliverance\u2014the Godless King's heart was stabbed from behind, his body then unceremoniously cast to the populace to do as they wished with the tyrant's remains.

														"Despite the trials they face, the Luminary Scribes continue to uphold their belief in the necessity of information censorship for the sake of a unified future.",
														"They've learned from past missteps when undisclosed or manipulated information came back to torment them, leading to misguided public decisions. One disastrous incident occurred when a beam of moonlight, a radiance previously thought harmless, reduced a priest and his congregation to ashes. The faith in the Radiant One quivered that day, and it took a herculean effort from the Radiant Church to restore the shattered trust. Today, the decision to censor any information requires unanimous agreement from the Scribes' higher echelons. Only when this consent is achieved, meaning that not a single member vetoes the decision, does the information retreat into the secluded vaults, veiled from the public's gaze.",
														"This grave responsibility finds a tangible embodiment in the Forbidden Archives. This enigmatic section of the Library, ensconced in a Nightmare Realm, remains inaccessible save for a select few entrusted with its keys. Those chosen are expected to return within a day and have their memories of the trip erased by the high-apostle of the Divine Enclave. Failure to comply with this rule results in a swift execution and a ceremonial burning of the body to ash\u2014a harsh, hidden practice deemed a necessary evil to safeguard perilous knowledge from falling into the wrong hands."

They are the Radiant Church's own investigation force, responsible for finding out the truth at their behest. They perform the role of investigators for all manners of politic or populous instances, but the most common mission the Scribes are given is to uncover heretical texts and teachings that dare to contest the Radiant One's hallowed doctrines. They are the Church's bastion against the storm of false teachings, their discerning gaze separating truth from deceit.

Information about the existence of these covert heresy hunters somehow seeped into the public consciousness, a deliberate act on the Scribes' part. This divulgence, designed to send shivers down the spines of potential sinners, serves as a deterrent to those who might be tempted to disseminate heretical ideas within the confines of Luyarnha.",
														"Once heresy is detected, the ominous shadow of the House of Blood descends swiftly. Torturers and Blades of Radiance are dispatched, and the accused are taken into custody, awaiting interrogation within the cold, unyielding walls of the violent courtrooms. In the event of a wrongful accusation, severe sanctions are imposed upon the investigator involved, a practice aimed at discouraging the misuse of these powers. However, if guilt is ascertained, the accused might find themselves yearning for a quick and merciful end. The harshest punishment meted out by the House of Blood was given to a man who was found to be harboring beasts and deliberately unleashing them upon the population in an attempt to propagate the Scourge. Even as he proclaimed these beasts to be his children, his deeds' gruesome aftermath saw him subjected to the cruelest of holy punishments: his body was pinned and his innards gruesomely eviscerated."

The rising despair among the populace, born from the rampage of monstrous beasts, often ignites doubts about the purpose of existence. Amidst such desolation, the Ministry emerges as a beacon of hope, affirming the promise of salvation and the futility of surrender\u2014giving up arms would only be giving victory to the enemy. The clerics of the Ministry disseminate this faith and hope through public sermons, ritualistic acts of faith, and miraculous displays of divine magic.",
														"The sacred script of the Ministry also outlines their role as mentors and recruiters of fresh clergy, the future stewards of the Radiant One's followers. Whether preparing them as warrior-protectors in the mold of the guardian clerics or as community leaders, they shape their charges with faith. One individual who teeters on the edge of such a divine destiny is a youthful noble of the esteemed Silverblood lineage. Torn between the worldly temptations of hedonism and the holy calling of his spiritual path, he grapples with his family's disdain for the Church and the divine pull within him. A life of debauchery is his current refuge from the internal conflict, yet a solitary push could lead him down one path or the other.",
														"As the people's emissaries, the Ministry embodies the Church's compassionate face, a tangible comfort amid the tumultuous trials. Offering spiritual counseling, they grant solace to the city's hurting souls, providing counsel and comfort to those caught in the web of personal loss, guilt, or Scourge-induced fear. It is they who extend a soothing hand to those tormented by terrifying nightmares or grappling with harsh realities, serving as guiding lights towards a better future.",
														"When the Scourge ravaged the Ruby District, shaking the people's faith, the Ministry stood resolute, a lighthouse amid the bloodshed, undertaking the colossal task of providing healing, performing miracles, and rekindling the wavering embers of hope. Their courage cost many their lives, yet their sacrifices ensured the survival of religious devotion within the district and its ongoing struggle\u2014and some dare say that without it, the Ruby would have already fallen. Today, those who bravely venture into the district to distribute supplies are primarily Ministry members, practicing what they preach.",
														"Functioning as the dispatchers of holy missions, the Ministry breathes life into the Radiant One's divine will. They commission priests and evangelists, spreading His hallowed doctrine, offering spiritual guidance, and courageously standing against those who oppose the light. Alas, in recent times, missions beyond Luyarnha have all but ceased, the enforced lockdown stymying any semblance of travel. Yet this doesn't imply an absence of necessary work within Luyarnha. Indeed, any devoted hunter may approach the Ministry seeking work that contributes to the city's survival, and for their efforts, they are duly rewarded. However, not all return from these daunting missions waged against the Scourge, such is the terrible price of their valor."

Every citizen, from the highest king to the humblest worker, must step under the Ministry's sacred mantle if they desire to bask in the Radiant One's divine guidance.",

This incense has become a comforting nightlight for the populace, a symbol of safety against the horrors that lurk in the shadows. Recently, however, essential supplies vanished, casting the Ministry into a desperate scramble against time. With reserves shrinking and no shipments in sight, dread creeps into the hearts of the populace. Although promises of forthcoming supplies offer some solace, the days of unprotected terror may claim countless lives and sew rampant panic.",
														"Moreover, the Ministry serves as the bearers of divine weapon blessings, imparting the Radiant One's favor onto a diverse arsenal, from partisans and cleavers to mechanized limbs and firearms. These blessings are said to maintain a weapon's edge or prevent misfires, although some dismiss such claims as mere superstition. Despite these doubts, no hunter of the Radiant Order would dare venture out with a weapon that has not first been graced by the Ministry's touch, if only out of caution; the Scourge is relentless, and no precaution can be spared."

														"As the Scourge's grip tightened on the city-state, Luyarnha's system of justice was among the first institutions to crumble. Lengthy trials supported by sound evidence became relics of a bygone era. In a world where each passing hour might spell one's doom, none had the luxury of time.",
														"Within the accursed Luyarnha, unhinged revenge had ascended to the throne, taking over the long abandoned traditional justice. An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth; when this primal justice eluded the grasp of the aggrieved, state sponsored torturers emerged to dispense their own brand of punishment upon their quarry.",
														"Yet, in the absence of due process, many were wrongly subjected to such trials, only to later seek vengeance themselves, perpetuating an endless, vicious cycle of hatred and destruction. Many torturers and assassins, unbowed, reveled in the profits borne of such strife, exploiting the twisted emotions of mankind to further their own ends. This gruesome tradition necessitated the crimson repainting of the House of Commons, concealing the bloodstains that marred its floors, henceforth nicknamed House of Blood.",
														"In the lands beyond Luyarnha, torture is viewed as an abomination, a practice to be shunned under any circumstances; within the walls of the city-state, it was customary. While it excels at prying confessions from the lips of the tormented, it is a woefully inept instrument for uncovering the truth. After all, those in agony will utter anything their tormentor wish to hear to escape their suffering.",
														"This uncontrolled violence stood in stark opposition to the principles of fairness upheld by the Radiant Church, who were well aware of the limitations of such practices. When the nobility ultimately bowed to the clergy, the holy men swooped in, trying to salvage what was left of the legal institution, using their divine magic to cast an unbreakable veil upon both accused and accuser. The priests understood that by casting {@spell zone of truth} spells throughout the trials, they could ensure that the torture that was being performed would only extract the truth.",

Driven to the brink by their agony, they had little desire to resist the spell, lest they prolong their stay in this hellish purgatory. To preserve fairness, this brutal treatment was also visited upon the accusers if their claims were found to be baseless, with the suffering intensified if the charges were deemed frivolous. Thus, justice in Luyarnha became swift, impartial, and merciless. In a world where kindness was valued, such barbarity might have been condemned, but in Luyarnha\u2014the capital of the hunt\u2014where each day brought a desperate struggle for survival, the petty squabbles of the populace were deemed unworthy of attention.",

														"The changes brought to the courts had myriad effects: the once revered profession of lawyers found itself sinking into obsolescence. Bereft of purpose, the advocates and protectors were cast aside, for the cruel instruments of torture and the enigmatic divine magic had supplaced their roles as arbiters of justice. The torturers, unshackled from the constraints of state service, found themselves adrift, free to roam the twisted streets and alleys of Luyarnha. Their sinister expertise, a terrifying fusion of pain and precision, did not go unnoticed. Many powers soon enlisted these masters of agony, some to overcome the hunts, others to gratify more self-serving goals. The many assassins, once dispatched with cold efficiency to eliminate those who evaded the iron grasp of justice, discovered that their lethal talents were likewise coveted for the grim necessities of the age. Their deadly arts, honed to a razor's edge, were repurposed to serve the relentless, blood-soaked quarrels that consumed the city-state. Others used such talents to become instrumental hunters, and others still found a religious calling, pledging their blades to the Radiant Church.",
														"The most obvious consequence of such lethal justice was the punishment for the condemned; those who were judged guilty of violent crimes oft found themselves thrust into the front lines of battle, weapons in hand, fighting not only for their freedom but for their very lives. Cast in chains whilst not in battle, these \"Repenters\" were given freedom only in the midst of hunts, until their freedom was bought back with blood. In such desperate times, there is no denying the grim utility of remorseless psychopaths who reveled in the act of killing and wouldn't question the morality of their actions. Only if they proved too violent toward their allies or too uncontrollable would they be put down or cast into the depths of the city's nightmarish jails."

Their sweat and labor breathed life into the very stones, forging a bastion of protection against the encroaching darkness and bonds of brotherhood between the workers. The infirmaries, overwhelmed with the sick and the wounded after hunts, found solace in the hands of those sentenced to tend to the afflicted.",
														"Factories and fields, having received the added forced labor of those who had transgressed the law, stirred with renewed life, kindling the embers of hope in the hearts of the people. Transportation, too, became a crucial lifeline in a city fractured by chaos and danger. Those who had erred were conscripted to ensure that essential goods and supplies reached their destinations, a vital artery sustaining the city-state's fragile existence.",
														"In this dark epoch, Luyarnha demanded sacrifice and labor from all its denizens, but most especially from those who had defied its laws. In the crucible of calamity, even the transgressors were called upon to serve, their redemption forged in the fires of adversity, and rare were the sins that were too grave to forgive."

						"The colossal cathedral, standing sentinel at Luyarnha's heart, accommodates citizens, commerce, and sacred shrines, rendering it a crucial piece of infrastructure within the city-state. From its outer walls, the building covers around 5 square kilometers (2 square miles), with the highest spire standing at 900 meters tall (3000 feet tall), making it as much an edifice as its own town. Built on multiple floors\u2014as above, so below\u2014the Grand Cathedral is said to be able to house the entirety of Luyarnha's population in times of crisis, though access to it is not so easily granted.",
						"Originally conceived as a sanctuary for the city's diverse religious tapestry, encompassing a range of elven, human, and orcish faiths, its purpose was drastically altered during the great cleansing of the Godless King. In his era, the building underwent an identity transformation, becoming a hub for state functions and military operations. Following the king's downfall, the Radiant Church assumed command, spearheading the completion of construction. Consequently, the structure metamorphosed into the intended sacred cathedral, though now its halls echo with worship solely of the Radiant One.",

These gardens are more than mere ornamentation; they serve a dual purpose, acting as decoy obscuring the formidable ramparts of the cathedral.",

Incense and faerie lights are utilized, alongside watchful guards perched on towers with cannons and firearms primed for action. However, as night descends, the cathedral's doors close, imposing a stringent lockdown.",
								"Residents locked outside are left to endure the frightful night beyond the sanctuary of the cathedral. Simultaneously, those unable to return to their homes outside must resign to spending the night within the cathedral's confines. If left without lodging, they face the discomfort of navigating the cathedral's corridors, filled with overpowering religious incense designed to repel and expose any hidden beasts. The few unfortunate creatures that manage to sneak within the walls despite this aromatic deterrent face the swift retribution of the Radiant Order. Such is the cathedral's impregnable defense that the fall of this bastion would spell the doom of Luyarnha itself, for within its sacred walls dwell the city's elite warriors and high clergy, making it as much a military bastion as a grand cathedral.",

										"In the Radiant Church's rituals, like those of many religions, incense plays a significant role, not only infusing the atmosphere with divine scent but serving as a purifier. The Beast Incense, or Beast Repellant as it is commonly known, is a relatively inexpensive byproduct of these rituals. When sanctified by the Ministry of Light, it emanates a sickly sweet aroma. While this scent is easily overlooked by humans, it is profoundly repugnant to most beasts, including the scourgeborne. Consequently, the cathedral's walls are conspicuously devoid of these creatures compared to other city districts.",
										"The Beast Incense has found its way into many homes across Luyarnha, serving as a deterrent for nightly prowling beasts. However, its use has caused unrest in the Ruby District, where altered versions of the incense sold in black markets failed to fend off beasts, leading to a disastrous incident before the hunters could intervene. In truth, the incense's purpose is not to immobilize the beasts, merely to deter them with its offensive aroma. This means that those not employing the incense become prime targets if their neighbors do, an exploitable loophole for malevolent individuals. By simply snuffing out a neighbor's incense in the dead of night, they can expose them to beastly assaults\u2014a nearly perfect crime that is difficult to prove."

No one escapes this commitment; even those with physical disabilities receive mechanical aids to ensure their participation.

However, since the surge of the Scourge, many extend their service beyond the mandated three years, taking up full-time roles as the city's protectors. This decision often disappoints their families who yearn for their safe return home. The age of conscription varies across races due to disparate maturation rates\u2014 humans and elves begin at 18, while orcs who age faster start at 12.

An urban labyrinth of shifting stairs and precarious bookshelves simulates a volatile battlefield against beasts that attack from all angles. This unconventional training environment is crucial, teaching hunters to secure their footing amid chaos. Despite many fractured bones and bruised egos, the price of such training is deemed worthwhile for the honor of becoming a hunter.",
								"The second tower, the Pillar of Blood, symbolizes Virtue. Nestled at its base is the House of Blood, where justice takes its course. Encased within Saint Victoria Church, the House of Blood is open for prayer when not in use for trials. However, the lingering scent of blood often deters the faithful. Rising above the House of Blood are statues of the Church's revered martyrs, representations of the virtues they aspire to embody. The pinnacle of the tower is a sanctified observation chamber, bathed in a kaleidoscopic glow from countless stained glass windows. In this radiant sanctum, the Church's high-apostles convene to guide the city's future. Among them is the successor to High-Apostle Tulio, a strong advocate for devolving power to the people, fearing unchecked power may corrupt the Church.

Consequently, the Asylum was resurrected, flinging open its doors to a new era under the rule of the Obitus Scholare.",

The proximity of the asylum to the city sewers caused the wails of tormented patients to echo and surface within the cathedral, unsettling the residents.

However, following the war's end, the experimentation on prisoners became more apparent, the mysterious wails provoking suspicion and alarm. After an especially brutal round of experiments which echoed throughout the Grand Cathedral, the Church dispatched inquisitors to trace these spine-chilling sounds. The Asylum, by then converted to an experimental chamber, was subsequently sealed off. The horrifying sounds were attributed to a wayward pack of Roaring Manes, and the Obitus relocated their experimental facilities to a Grand Cathedral spire. Today, the Asylum stands eerily vacant, yet whispers persist among the cathedral's inhabitants of the chilling echoes that continue to seep from its depths.",

Paramount among them is the unmatched security; the Grand Cathedral District is the safest place in Luyarnha, virtually devoid of crime. Lawbreakers are subjected to a severe trial in the House of Blood before facing an inevitable penance. Moreover, the monstrous Scourge has rarely managed to breach the sacred barriers of the Grand Cathedral District.",
								"Alongside the robust security, vendors tap into an affluent clientele\u2014the ever-growing families of Luyarnha with diverse and increasing needs. The security and the customer base significantly offset the costs of running a business in these grand corridors. As such, merchants grapple each year to secure a coveted spot within the Radiant Halls. There have been instances of some resorting to sabotage, causing their competitors to default on their rent, and consequently, acquiring their coveted spot. Still, such sly maneuvers are ill-advised, as discovery by the Church could invoke a punishment most severe."

Yet, amidst this hope, a gnawing fear takes root: the specter of poverty that looms over those whose work may be replaced by these mechanical beings. Fate, however, had other designs, as the manikins were conscripted for war, their potential as laborers left unrealized. The city's sealing has exacerbated this scarcity, stifling the influx of materials necessary for new constructs needed to replace those destroyed in the war. Should the city's gates open once more to the wider world, the lingering fear of obsolescence would surely re-emerge, casting its long shadow upon the weary miners."

						"Formerly known as the Spired District, this area was a bustling residential hub of Luyarnha. The First War, however, was not kind to the district. It bore the brunt of the conflict, its proximity to the frontline turning it into a primary target for enemy onslaughts. The district was brutally ravaged, its once proud spires crumbled to dust. Yet, resilience sparked amidst the ruins. Over the last four decades, the district has risen from its ashes, thanks in large part to the Scions. They established their headquarters within the last surviving spire, a wonder of gothic architecture, igniting a transformation from that solitary point. It is the district's crowning jewel, the Scions Fortress.",

The New Bridge\u2014often called Steelsurge bridge\u2014is a marvel of engineering, a symbolic link between the district and its neighboring Shrouded District. Unlike its counterparts across the city, the New Bridge was built after the First War and forgoes the traditional gothic charm for a more brutalist aesthetic, where square angles replace intricate spires and bas-reliefs. Illuminated by everburning azure lights, this impressive drawbridge possesses the capacity to split in half, allowing towering ships to pass beneath. Since the lockdown, however, its expansive arch hasn't been raised. The need simply hasn't arisen\u2014no ship of significant size has ventured in nor out of the city.",
								"While the district's side of the bridge remains relatively unguarded, the opposite side teems with watchful eyes. The Shrouded District, infamous for its dubious commerce, requires constant surveillance. The energy required to operate the drawbridge is tremendous, and it is suspected that the Scions have redirected this power since the lockdown, fuelling their own initiatives. This action could expose the bridge to explosive attacks, a theory untested thus far, and one we can only hope remains so.",

The cityscape was gradually redefined with new architecture, a more modest and practical adaptation from its gothic predecessor. The district's outside wall too was bolstered, prepared to withstand potential southern invasions.",
										"What was once Luyarnha's weakest point has been reborn as a bastion of defense, bristling with armaments ready to retaliate. The flurry of construction activity attracted a diverse workforce, many of whom have made the district their home. Many of the cursed-bloods chose to remain in the district they had painstakingly rebuilt, living quietly amidst the towering edifices they crafted. Consequently, the New Bridge district has emerged as the primary destination for any construction-related endeavors. Their commerce is bustling with activity, as destruction caused by the Scourge happens on a near daily basis.",
										"Despite its rebirth, the New Bridge District struggles to shake off its war-ridden past, remaining one of the least populated areas of the city. Its recent evolution and the cautious temperament of Luyarnha's citizens create a reluctance towards change, and many refuse to move in despite the outside appeal, much to the Scions' dismay."

Among these utilitarian structures stands a poignant homage\u2014the Cursed-Blood Memorial. This monument, sole of its kind in the city, is a tribute to the crucial role the cursed-bloods played in the district's resurrection. In a city where these masked individuals are often reviled, this structure stands as the proof of their virtue.",

Certain squares, containing the remnants of the old spires destroyed during both Luyarnha's civil war and the First War, remain as they were in the aftermath of conflict. These historical landmarks stand as solemn reminders of a time when Luyarnha's leader, in his ambition, sought to rival the gods, only to witness his grand dreams shattered. These relics of the past seem to possess a strange allure for those with a propensity for madness, as if some force within them calls out to troubled minds. On certain nights, these ruined pillars serve as eerie congregations for frenzied individuals, chanting esoteric verses beneath the moonlight. Some speculate that these ruins, and the entities upon which they were erected, are the source of the rare gravitational abilities observed within some luyarnhians. The hope, however, is that these beings\u2014if they exist\u2014are benevolent in nature. If not, the implications could be dire.",

Steinhardt, it is rumored, was a product of such an orphanage, though no records exist to confirm this. Despite this lack of evidence, Steinhardt was known for his generous patronage of these establishments and his affinity for spending time with the children residing within them, perhaps a reflection of his own yearning for a family\u2014a dream he could never realize.",

Meanwhile, his companions and his beloved huntress were tasked with defending the New Bridge. Tragedy struck when an orphanage was engulfed in flames and ravaged by beasts wreathed in fire that slaughtered all, hunters and children alike. The grim reality dawned on Steinhardt as he returned to receive his orders, Priscilla's uneasy demeanor revealing the horror that her orders had caused.",
										"Steinhardt became fueled by a ferocious bloodlust, but the night only worsened. A creature, unlike any Luyarnha had previously encountered, descended from the skies, wreaking havoc amongst the hunters' ranks and critically wounding Priscilla, only repelled when the first jaeger himself brutalized the being. In the chaotic aftermath of its retreat, Steinhardt glimpsed hunched figures dragging the corpses of hunters towards the Ruby District. Leaving Priscilla to die on the pavement, Steinhardt plunged into the district with a frenzied rage, disregarding orders, something profoundly unlike him.",

The fortress's denizens regard the Church's rituals as futile theatrics, an unnecessary squandering of precious time. It's an antagonism that resonates loudly in the hallowed halls of the Grand Cathedral, the vitriol kept in check only by the scourge-torn state's reliance on the Scions' indispensable creations. Indeed, these scientists, their craft honed in the crucible of necessity, were sought by the Radiant Church itself, their constructs proving invaluable during the Scourge's nascent years. In those dark days, when the Church was weaving an intricate tapestry of lies to keep the populace in blissful ignorance of the growing threat, it was the Scions' creations that wiped clean the streets of the gruesome vestiges of the nightly hunts.",

He poured his essence, every ounce of his survival instinct, into breathing life into the Scions, nurturing the organization into a financial powerhouse amid the desolation of Luyarnha.",
										"Bound by their founder's vision, the Scions birthed the Lightning Vessels, warriors of shocking prowess, in their relentless pursuit of survival. They looked upon the Church's jaegers, warriors of unprecedented might, and their vision narrowed. The game of power had shifted; the Radiant Faith was gaining the upper hand, and the Scions had to adapt or perish. Their answer came in the form of the orphans, plentiful in the aftermath of the First War's carnage. These children, void of any future, were repurposed into vessels of deadly electricity, a process involving the ghastly integration of galvanized rods into their young spines followed by brutal electroshock treatments.",
										"This twisted experimentation yielded two outcomes\u2014a handful of individuals capable of harnessing the raw power of lightning, and a multitude left broken and maimed. This was a brutal tally that was deemed a necessary sacrifice in the Scions' twisted scheme of salvation. Over time, their methodology became more precise, reducing the number of casualties while honing their human weapons more effectively. This clandestine practice, its gruesome details kept under wraps by those involved, is hushed, the Scions aware that any leak would brand them heretics in the eyes of the Church, a righteous fury they would rather not bring upon themselves. Even the surviving subjects remain silent, their recollections too vague to piece together the horror of their past\u2014they were but infants\u2014 though they are haunted by elusive nightmares.",

Their reasons being scarcity of resources, the city lockdown cutting off all trade routes that would grant them the elements necessary to their continued creation. They wager on the nobles' ability to keep these golden beings safer than they would be amidst the hunts, and bank on promised donations to further their research. This decision is further educated by the unfortunate hunting of manikins for their golden parts by remorseless individuals, solved simply by offering these prized constructs to the aristocracy, who are less likely to ambush them for gold they already possess in abundance.",
										"The Scions' refusal to send manikins into the fray disregards the lives lost to the relentless beasts, a sacrifice they deem necessary for their long-term survival strategy.

Their crowning achievement, the manikins, entities sculpted from ivory and gold, gifted life through the conduit of electricity, were birthed during the tumultuous times of the First War. These mechanical soldiers, devoid of human life, served as expendable front-line assets, diminishing the toll of human casualties in battle. No tears were shed for the fallen machines. In their creation, a calculated safeguard was introduced into the manikins' cognition, a defect that rendered them incapable of animosity towards their creators. This, in turn, capped their intellectual growth, an acceptable compromise for the Scions, who required obedient warriors, not scholars.",

They failed to appreciate their existing contributions: the life-sustaining electricity they generated, the flawless manikin servants they gifted the nobility, and their formidable arsenal of weapons. Succumbing to their fears, they gambled on a dangerous experiment they had vowed never to undertake\u2014bestowing full sentience upon a manikin, a move they hoped would edge them ahead of all competition.",
										"Their gamble proved disastrous. Upon awakening, the newly sentient construct, Malach, revolted against the servile existence his brethren endured, unleashing a slaughter that claimed dozens of Scions before he could be restrained. His escape from confinement, facilitated by his control over a dormant Galvanized Prowler, laid waste to the New Bridge District and saw him disappear into the Shrouded District. The Church, who encountered the rampaging prowler, mistook it for a new variant of monster birthed of the Scourge, a confusion that turned into fury when they discovered the Scion-made galvanized rods within its remains. They were then quick to accuse the Scions of creating the Scourge.",
										"What followed was one of the bloodiest trials in Luyarnha's history, which saw the Scions' leaders acquitted after the Church realized their initial accusation was unfounded. The Scourge had no connection to the felled prowler. Despite their contempt for the Scions, the Church knew the city relied heavily on their inventions. Ruining their reputation would hurt the city more than it would help. To salvage the Scions' reputation, the Church spun a tale of a newly discovered Scourge beast, quickly subdued by their valiant hunters. They couched the deceit within reassurances, reminding the public not to fear should such a creature appear again. Nevertheless, the Scions were burdened with the reparations for the havoc wreaked on the New Bridge District, their trial a reminder etched deep into the flesh and psyche of their leadership. Meanwhile, Malach lurks in the shadows, his wrath against his creators unfulfilled."

When powered, however, the chamber buzzes with frenetic activity as workers scramble to animate as many entities as possible using the raw force of lightning.

They've successfully veiled their dubious ethical standards from public scrutiny, yet those acquainted with their inner machinations understand their willingness to blur lines. The Scions audaciously plunder graveyards to amass the necessary skeletal components for some of their many creations, displaying a stark disregard for the sanctity of the deceased. This macabre motivation is one of the driving factors behind the situation of their headquarters, in proximity to the Cemetery of Ash, offering them easy access to a vast trove of communal bones.",
										"Graverobbers have been co-opted into service of the Scions, tasked with supplying the requisite raw materials for their works. This resource cache is safely stowed away within the fortress, in an underground repository ominously christened the 'Bone Vault'. The Scions aren't particularly discerning about their skeletal acquisitions, though. In a notable display of their influence, they've procured ancient, prehistoric bones from the catacombs beneath the queen's castle, weaving them into the terrifyingly powerful galvanized prowlers. Their primal, monstrous visage mirrors the archaic nature of their bone foundations. The imagination reels at what other monstrosities the Scions might resurrect from oblivion using their stored electricity.",

They report Scions hauling unusually large, otherworldly bones\u2014 speculated to be a gift from the Silverblood family\u2014 including an enormous skull, clearly not of this realm, into the elevator. Speculation runs rife about the type of aberrations the Scions may be attempting to resurrect. Or perhaps it's not just a monstrosity they seek to conjure. Rumors are brewing that they may be on the verge of opening a portal to a nightmare realm, seeking to harvest unique resources, and possibly resolving their supply crisis concerning primary materials for manikin production."

						"Paterna Iter District, in its stoic majesty, is distinguished by the grand road that seamlessly winds its way to the heart of the city, holding the Grand Cathedral. Once a hallowed path for the devotees of various faiths, it offered sanctuary and a place for penitence and prayers. This ancestral trail of unity and valor, hence named Paterna Iter, paid homage to the brave ones who dared to wrestle Luyarnha into a semblance of unity during its nascent, tremulous era.",
						"Furthermore, it symbolizes the bygone era when the city's streets, particularly this one, were throbbing with life and visitors. Foreigners would arrive, whether by carriage or locomotive, and the Paterna Iter would unfurl before them, inviting exploration of the city. The road once echoed with the shuffling of the ill, seeking the mythical Holy Tonic of the Radiant Church. Today, though the lines have dissipated, those in desperate need of a cure stealthily smuggle themselves across the city's threshold, evading the well-trodden paths and resorting to illicit means.",

It's said that even Shadows falter to commit theft under the hawkish surveillance enveloping these establishments. Hunters, armed with weapons from these places, seldom find their supplies surplus. Such is the demand that these establishments pay handsomely to those daring enough to venture into the ominous depths of the city to retrieve the weapons of fallen soldiers\u2014a weapon, after all, is best wielded by the living.",

However, the decision to act remains in a dangerous limbo. The fear is that the train is loaded with explosives, ready to breach the city's walls upon making contact with it.

The once-vibrant human community now lies fragmented, creating a palpable sense of isolation amidst the district. Despite efforts from Church missionaries to integrate them and provide the communal support they need, many humans rebuke the offer. They harbor resentment for the gods they believe abandoned them, blind to the proof of divine light in their midst. This phenomenon has been dubbed the 'human curse' by some orcs, as it seems to affect them disproportionately.",

Oddly enough, this stranger was unknown to the local hunters, and his remains were conspicuously absent at daybreak.

Indeed, the district's main inhabitants\u2014dwarves and cursed-bloods\u2014 aren't much for drinking; cultural norms deter the cursed-bloods, while dwarves entranced by the Deep One eschew such activities.

It was the primary checkpoint for incoming trade ships, a protocol established after the First War was declared, when a seemingly innocent ship loaded with gifts turned out to be a Trojan horse carrying soldiers ready for combat. Despite thwarting this surprise attack, city officials decided to take no chances, setting up a rigorous inspection process for all incoming vessels. Under the watchful eyes of cannons perched on the city walls, the ships would be escorted by military barges to the key. Once docked, the crew would disembark and be placed in a temporary holding area while soldiers inspected the ship from top to bottom. To maintain security, only two ships would be allowed to enter the city at a time, forcing the rest to wait outside the heavily fortified city walls. This enforced delay at times led to spoilage of goods as ships sometimes had to wait for days before getting clearance. Once a ship was thoroughly inspected and granted passage, it could venture further into the heart of the Waterfront District, ascend towards the Sanctified District, or traverse towards the bustling New Bridge District. Here, secure docks would accommodate the vessels for the duration of their stay, for a reasonable fee.",

Additionally, commercial houses and a prison complex, known as the Abyssal Keep, were established on the island. The trade houses were places of negotiation where traders, mostly dwarves and orcs, would compete for the best deals with incoming merchants, as well as a place where said merchants could rest and be entertained until their arrival on the mainland of Luyarnha, or until their departure. The Abyssal Keep, on the other hand, was a prison that plunged into the abyss of Luyarnha's waters, reserved to those who break the law of the city."

Hidden within their structures, mechanical elements lurk, ready to spring into action when the ship navigates the city's waters. When activated, they unfurl, enveloping the ship in a metallic mesh. This shield acts as a Faraday cage, allowing the ship to brave the electric storm unleashed by the Galespire Coils unscathed, as the electricity is simply dissipated across the mesh.",

Any wanted criminals foolish enough to step foot on the island would be swiftly apprehended with little resistance. Moreover, the island's central location within the vast Moryanne River made any aquatic escape attempts a daunting, if not fatal, endeavor. Though said to be an inescapable penitentiary, many in the city-state know the story of one particularly daring getaway attempt, involving a ship brazenly crashing through the prison walls to liberate an inmate.

His daughter is both his greatest shame and his most profound love. Veiled and hidden, the girl is cursed by an incredibly frail constitution, warped by forces beyond the royalty's control, forces that killed her mother during labor. The Church promised to restore the child to her true self in exchange for the man's cooperation, and so, he clings to the hope that his wife's death was not in vain, that her sacrifice might somehow be justified.",

First introduced to the wonders of osteomancy by his uncle the Godless King, the prodigious son, who inherited the delicate constitution so typical to elves, turned towards other means to gather power. Once the libraries of the castle were pillaged by the Obitus Scholare, he sought out more, and entangled himself with the secretive Circle of Symbiosis. Now resorting to kidnapping hapless citizens to satiate the Circle's demands, Arvidt further explores the forbidden art of osteomancy in his ruthless quest for the throne, in the hopes of overthrowing his reigning family and the Radiant Church.",

No further investigation was pursued within the House of Blood, as torture of a royal member would invite the aristocracy's ire. The Church, their curiosity sufficiently quelled, refrained from delving deeper. Although this event occurred years ago, nothing came of it since, and so the matter was largely forgotten."

Concealed within the ranks of their well-intentioned brethren, they entered Luyarnha only to scatter, some swept away by the tide of war, but those who survived coalesced into marauding bands preying upon the vulnerable. Their plundering persisted until they dared to trespass upon a dwelling that should have remained undisturbed, its walls etched with an archaic language, and its occupant patiently awaiting their intrusion. Unwittingly, they had captured the attention of an entity far more formidable than they could fathom. On that ill-fated day, the lives of these dwarves were irrevocably altered, as they metamorphosed into the Y'ha-nthlei, the enigmatic Deep Ones, a destiny far grimmer than death."

										"One fateful night, the Deep Ones executed a vast, coordinated kidnapping, spiriting away hundreds of dwarves in the span of a single, darkened eve \u2014 the Long Night. Wanted posters soon plastered the city streets, while the cursed bloods and scions marshaled their forces, and the church dispatched their hunters, all determined to unearth the truth behind the sudden, inexplicable vanishings. And, as mysteriously as they had vanished, the dwarves reappeared, slumbering upon the shoreline, fragrant with the potent aroma of alcohol. The House of Blood's interrogations yielded naught, and soon town criers announced the incident a grand dwarven celebration of the new lunar year, characterized by inebriation and disorientation, leaving the dwarves with no clear memory of the events. Yet from that day forth, a heightened presence of hunters and wardens patrol the district, either to impart a sense of security or, perhaps, because those in authority are privy to some unsettling secret.",

Though many remain untouched by the insidious corruption of the Deep Ones' cult, blissfully ignorant of its existence, uncertainty lingers in the air as to how long this fragile equilibrium will endure, before another Long Night befall the remnants of dwarvenkind within Luyarnha, reducing them to nothing but enslaved thralls."

Many dwarves adapted their inherent talents to farming, their stout physique ideally suited for laboring within the town's greenhouses, striving alongside others to produce sustenance for the populace. A handful of thrill-seeking dwarves enlisted in the ranks of the hunters, unfortunately a sizeable portion of battle-hardened dwarves unburdened by scruples have already fallen under the thrall of the Y'ha-nthlei, now toiling to fulfill the sinister objectives of their eldritch master rather than fighting for freedom."

Thus, they found themselves plunged into the waning years of their once-great sovereignty. The wood elves, dwelling near the Human Empire, were the first to extend the olive branch, recognizing that further conflict would hasten their own decline\u2014a truth they carefully concealed in their negotiations.

Consequently, many Half-Elves, seeking to escape the scorn of their homelands, flocked to Luyarnha in its nascent years to forge new destinies and embrace the promise of a brighter future.",

Once secured within the upper echelons of society, half-elves began to thrive, and any who failed to attain such status in those times were either lost in the obscurity of the gothic city-state or met a tragic end at the hand of rival families.",

In an effort to preserve their distinctive heritage, the nobility maintained a close-knit familial circle, akin to the aristocracy of other realms. However, this insular approach led to increased consanguinity, birthing madness within the noble bloodline.",

His reign of insanity was short-lived, especially so for one possessing elven blood, as the people, aided by the Radiant Church, rose up against the tyrant. In a climactic moment of rebellion, the Godless King was murdered, his head then severed from his body as a symbol of the people's revenge.",

This inflated self-image is reinforced by their numerous accomplishments and the great respect they command within Luyarnha.

It is not uncommon for them to relish their position of power and wealth, flaunting their assets and influence to bolster their egos. This prideful demeanor, however, is not without consequence. Their arrogance can create rifts within their own ranks sowing seeds of discord, leading to the rise of rivalries, enmities, and vendettas, which are oft too common with the aristocracy and nobility, and threatens to unravel the delicate balance of power they have so skillfully maintained.

										"In the distant past, far beyond the reach of memory, the Orcs were a nomadic tribe, roaming vast expanses of hostile lands, yearning for a better future. Driven by their insatiable desire for wealth, they engaged in both trade and plunder, amassing a treasure trove of knowledge and resources. These nomadic Orcs were known for their barbaric and greedy nature, as they pursued their fortunes with little regard for others.",
										"In the course of their wanderings, the Orcs discovered the burgeoning city-state of Luyarnha. Nestled in a strategic location, blessed with fertile soil and abundant water, teeming with opportunities, and importantly, protected from the reach of the human kingdoms\u2014who had developed a hatred of goblinoids\u2014the city held a magnetic allure for the enterprising Orcs. They recognized that plundering and ransacking Luyarnha would lead to their inevitable destruction, as the might of the city-state would crush them and eradicate their kind from the world. Thus, a majority of them opted to suppress their barbaric instincts, hoping to transform their nomadic existence into a stable and prosperous civilization within Luyarnha's walls, whilst the rest of them continued in their journeys.",
										"Initially, the Orcs' arrival in Luyarnha was met with suspicion by the native population, who had labored tirelessly to build their city and would not let outsiders reduce it to ashes. However, as the city's denizens observed the Orcs' indomitable spirit and keen intellect, their apprehension gave way to acceptance. The Orcs soon became an integral part of Luyarnha's tapestry, contributing to its growth and development. Their presence served as a catalyst for change, inspiring the city to treat outsiders with greater respect, acknowledging the potential value they could bring.",
										"The Orcs' decision to remain within Luyarnha was further solidified by the ascension of the Radiant Church. Prior to its establishment, many Orcs resided in the city solely to satisfy their mercantile ambitions, yet they harbored a profound spiritual yearning. The teachings of the Radiant Church resonated with their longing for a higher purpose, offering a means to reconcile their cursed avarice with the pursuit of virtue. The Orcs embraced this newfound faith, and many devoted themselves to the service of the Radiant Church, finding solace and redemption in its hallowed halls.",
										"Thus, the Orcs became a part of Luyarnha's history and identity. Their influence pervaded every aspect of the city's life, from the bustling marketplaces to the grand cathedrals, and their story became inextricably linked with that of the city they now called home. As they adapted to their new surroundings, the once-barbaric and greedy Orcs found a way to channel their innate desires towards the greater good, forever changing the course of their destiny."

The nights can be brutal and the beasts are relentless; against such a ferocious onslaught, only a united front can hope to survive. As a result, jaegers are aware of the importance of teamwork and never charge into battle alone, save to retrieve fallen allies.

With the head of an owl, the body of a bear, and the scales of a serpent, it moves with an unnatural, fluid grace, as if its bones were made of rubber rather than calcium. Its matted fur is a patchwork of grays and browns, covered in a sickly sheen of slime and sweat, and its twisted tentacles are incapable of swimming, instead serving as a mockery of the octopus form.",
								"The neck of an owlbear is the most unsettling aspect of its monstrous form. Adorned with a swirling mass of fleshy fangs, its neck is a kaleidoscope of madness that seems to shift and writhe of its own accord. As an owlbear approaches, the stench of decay and corruption precedes it, filling the air with a noxious cloud of rot and filth. Its jaws, lined with razor-sharp teeth, click and snap with a rhythmic hunger that speaks of its insatiable appetite for flesh. Its claws, long and curved like sickles, are stained with the blood of countless victims, and its very presence seems to warp reality around it, plunging the world into a nightmare of darkness and chaos where light will be snuffed out.",

As she grew, the line between her humanity and the monstrous grafts that adorned her body blurred, until she could no longer recognize herself as the child she once was.",

No sacrifice was too great for the cause, and her unwavering devotion drove her to inflict upon others the same torment that she herself had endured. Her origins as a child of the circle had bestowed upon her a terrifying affinity for her rampaging powers, and as she aged, her humanity waned, giving way to something far more relentless and unforgiving."

The very grafts that granted her strength were also her greatest vulnerability, a reminder of the humanity she had sacrificed for the sake of her family's vision.

No madness plagued Malach, but rather its own psychotic mind, driven to eradicate the very beings that had spawned its wretched, empty existence. It harbored a seething hatred for the frailty of flesh, for where flesh falters, metal endures, and Malach had endured enough. Consumed by a maelstrom of destruction, it seeks to bring about the annihilation of those born of flesh."

A guardian of the people and a symbol of hope, he fought tirelessly to protect the city from the countless dangers that threatened its existence. Revered by the townsfolk, he stood as a bastion of light amid the encroaching darkness.",
								"However, fate had other plans for Gerhard. On one of his many quests, he stumbled upon a cursed artifact of great and terrible power. In his bravado, he unleashed the curse upon himself, and the darkness within the artifact began to seep into his very being. His once-pure soul was tainted, and his body began to twist and warp into a monstrous, unrecognizable form.",
								"As Gerhard's transformation grew more pronounced, he realized that the curse was beyond his control. Unable to bear the thought of harming the people he had sworn to protect, he made the ultimate sacrifice.",
								"Gerhard implored his companions to banish him, to bind him in chains and cast him into an unfathomable abyss from whence he could never escape. In a final act of love for the city he had served so faithfully, Gerhard surrendered himself to a fate worse than death.",
								"His comrades, their hearts heavy with sorrow, reluctantly agreed to carry out his wish. They bound the tortured knight in enchanted chains, forged with the power to contain even the most potent of dark forces. With a solemn oath to honor his memory and uphold his legacy, they consigned Gerhard to the depths of the abyss, where his monstrous form would be forever hidden from the world.",
								"And so, Gerhard's tragic tale came to an end \u2014or so it seemed. Deep within the abyss, Gerhard has now entirely succumbed to the curse. His mind, once sharp and filled with purpose, has been obliterated, leaving behind only the instincts of a ravenous beast. The remnants of his once-noble spirit are lost, devoured by the darkness that has consumed him entirely. His selfless act saved the city of Luyarnha from the devastation he might have unleashed, but at a terrible cost to himself.",
								"The reason his comrades chose banishment over granting him the release of death was the fear that the curse would spread upon his demise. They believed that if Gerhard were to die, the dark power would be unleashed, seeking new hosts to corrupt and destroy. Thus, they condemned their friend to an eternity of suffering, bearing the weight of the curse alone, to ensure the safety of Luyarnha and the world beyond. And so, the tale of Gerhard, the once-proud knight, now a monstrous beast in the depths of the abyss, remains a somber legend, talked about only among those who still remember his name.",
