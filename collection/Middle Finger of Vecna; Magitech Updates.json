Through equal part experimentation and theory, it is now understood that the Weave follows its own physical principles, albeit complex ones, no different from those of the natural world. An approximation of this understanding has been demonstrated throughout history by the creation of magic items; the rules of magic can be channeled by physical means.",
						"Technology that has grown in tandem with the mastery of magic seeks not to compete with magic, but to harness it. {@b Magitech} is a catch-all term for technology designed to exploit the natural laws that the Weave obeys, in much the same way that wizards do to craft spells. The simplest and most benign forms of magitech are ever-glowing lanterns which adorn public city streets, though more complex forms, such as wands and powerful magic items, also exist.",

								"The most prevalent technology in worlds of magitech is the construct. In general, constructs are autonomous technologies which can perform tasks. Physically, constructs can resemble any form which allows them to efficiently accomplish the task for which they are created, but a common form is that of a bipedal humanoid, as this tends to be non-threatening and approachable, while also being incredibly versatile. The intelligence imbued to constructs varies greatly, from those programmed with a simple set of instructions by their creators, to those which have been imbued partial or complete sentience by very powerful magic, in order to accomplish suitably nuanced tasks. Several different and unique tiers of magitech constructs exist.",
								{

									"type": "entries",
									"entries": [
										"Constructs of the lowest tier are simply created for a limited purpose. These are abundant in societies which have embraced the manufacture of constructs, as they fulfill necessary, but extremely simple tasks. Garbage-collection, rope-making, textile creation, and sometimes even harvesting crops fall under the dumb constructs domain.",
										"These constructs are only in rare cases able to respond in a meaningful way when their orders meet the limits of their programming. They are, however, cheap, plentiful, and simple to build."
									]

								{
									"name": "\"Smart\" Constructs",
									"type": "entries",

Intelligent constructs are sufficiently intelligent that they might convince an untrained individual of their intelligence. Able to competently converse and perform tasks which require some simple problem solving, smart constructs are often tasked with more delicate matters, such as being a butler in a noble house or directing newcomers in a city. Such intelligence is little more than a ruse, however; smart constructs have little sense of self, and their semblance of intelligence may fail when asked to think critically about a problem."

The immense eldritch machines which created the Warforged, the Creation Forges, are immeasurably complex, and are perhaps beyond the understanding of any one being. Warforged are able to think and reason just as a living being would, and even possess emotions.",
										"Living constructs pose a vital question to the residents of Eberron: what is life? Do the Creation Forges really take mundane materials like stone and metal and imbue them with life, or are the Warforged merely a perfect facsimile of living beings? Furthermore, do the Warforged possess souls? What is to occur to them upon their deaths? Such questions should be handled carefully by a Dungeon Master who intends to include the Warforged, or a similar race of living constructs, within their world."

Airships in Ebberon, for example, still look much like oceangoing vessels, but are replete with control fins and rudders rather than sails. They are powered by a captured fire elemental, which flies in a ring around the ship with extreme speed, propelling the vessel forward. Other types of airships might fly with wings and conjured wind from the Elemental Plane of Air, or they may fly with a powerful and temperamental form of antigravity magic, like an expanded form of the spell levitate.",
										"The presence of airships changes the very texture of a fantasy world. With this single addition, geographic obstacles no longer impede the travel of adventurers, long travels through hazardous territory will be unnecessary to reach their goals, and encounters with monsters while traveling will all but disappear. However, it opens an entire vista of three-dimensional airborne combat, and will allow adventurers to focus on the goal, rather than the journey. A Dungeon Master should carefully consider the positive and negative consequences before including Airships in their campaign."

It is constructed around the basis of conductor stones, rather than metal rails, and is powered by a contained Elemental.",
										"Shipping tons of freight each day, the lightning rail builds the cities it connects into massive trade hubs, grand intersections for culture and goods. Those who own the rail lines are class of powerful moguls, and have immense political power. For this reason, combined with the affluence once can demonstrate with magitech, these masters of capital stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the noble elite.",

It follows that constructs are directly connected with Divine Law, as constructs by their nature are driven by physical principles and binary programming. The juncture between Arcane magitech constructs and the infinite powers of the Divine often center around the interplay between Mechanus and the Prime Material plane, and the perceptions people have of it. Many people, including those that erected the first constructs and imbued them with motion, think little of what the gods have to do with magitech, yet others hold that whatever divine significance magitech has, it must filter down from Mechanus.",

As any Gearpriest will divulge, the Universal Gears are beyond any mere mortal's comprehension, and therefore the actions of the faith may seem mysterious or perhaps even random, but it is doubtless to the true believer that the divine contract is being carried out.",
