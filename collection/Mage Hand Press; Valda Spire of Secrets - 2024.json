Once the manor is first created, these details are recorded in the miniature manor used to cast the spell and can't be changed. The manor contains sufficient food to feed up to 100 people for seven days. Furnishings and other objects created by this spell dissipate into smoke if taken beyond the estate's perimeter.",
                "The manor is staffed by 50 Skeletons obedient to you, and contains enough food to serve 50 people each day for a week. The skeletons can perform any task a normal human servant could perform, but they can't attack or take any action that would directly harm another creature. Any skeleton that leaves the estate's perimeter dies. Any Humanoid buried in the manor's courtyard rises 24 hours later as a Ghoul indefinitely under your control. You can have up to 10 such ghouls at once. If given no instructions, these ghouls patrol the estate. Any Undead created by this spell dies if it leaves the estate's perimeter.",
                "When the spell ends, the manor is magically drawn back into the rift. If you cast the spell once every seven days for 365 days in the same location, the manor becomes permanent and can't be dispelled."
