The infected creature suffers one level of {@condition exhaustion}, has disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks, and requires twice the usual amount of water each day. At the end of each long rest, the infected creature must make a {@dc 15} Constitution saving throw against the disease. A successful save decreases its level of {@condition exhaustion} by one.

After one failed save, the creature must succeed on a {@dc 15} Wisdom saving throw whenever it is placed in a stressful situation or spend its turn making a melee attack against the nearest creature, moving up to its speed if necessary. The DC for this saving throw increases by 2 for each level of {@condition exhaustion} above 1.

							"Around the same height as a man, but typically broader, bugbears are covered in a pelt of shaggy hair ranging from black to reddishblonde, save for the palms of their hands, flats of their feet, and the very fronts of their square, brutish faces. In some Northern tribes, this hair is replaced in winter with a white coat. Their hands and feet are covered in a soft pad, making their tread almost silent. Males and females are nearly identical, and what few differences they do have are hidden to others under their hair.",
							"Bugbears are primarily carnivorous, but can scrape by on vegetable matter in lean times. Their stealth and ambush tactics make them excellent hunters and they specialize in taking down large game.Trolls are a particular delicacy, as bugbears believe that eating their flesh will grant them some measure of their regenerative power.",
							"Clothing and armor is simple; their layer of fur means they have little need for clothing to keep warm, and when a bugbear meets an enemy in battle it is usually convinced it will triumph regardless of the odds, so armor is of limited importance. One adornment they will not hold back on is the variety of trinkets, talismans, and amulets they will weave into their hair for additional protection and good luck. Warriors may also sport a severed head or two hanging from their belt on their way back from battle.",
							"As the largest of the goblin races, bugbears dominate their smaller kin individually, though hobgoblin discipline and goblin numbers can turn the odds against them. Lone bugbears sometimes take control of a goblin troop, a task made easy by their cunning and brute strength. They do not fare so well against hobgoblins, who pose a more even match and bugbears view them with a grudging respect. On occasions when the two races do work together, most commonly with the bugbears working as a mercenary scouting force under the hobgoblins, the bugbears often resent the hobgoblins' superior attitude and seek to undermine their authority. In extreme cases, they will break their alliance with a few assassinations and disappear into the night.",
							"As well as their predisposition for ambushes and raids rather than battle, bugbears' reliance on signs makes it rare for them to actually make war or engage in any sustained conflict; an ill-omened flight of birds or prophetic dream could easily put a halt on a military campaign. Despite this, those removed from traditional bugbear culture are commonly found as mercenaries in the civilized world, and often ply their trade as assassins."

The one notable exception to this is when a bugbear dedicates their life to a cause, such as vengeance, retribution, or war. Here, they will make a declaration of their intent, and a sacrifice of their totem animal, symbolizing their death and rebirth as an instrument of the cause. One creature revered by all is the owl, as the embodiment of the silent hunter. Any who kill an owl may, indeed must, be killed without repercussion.",
							"A bugbear will carve small amulets of stone or wood representing its totem, along with other animals and more abstract designs. These it will weave into its longer strands of hair, along with mementos of significant hunts and trophies from worthy foes. It is believed that these will curry favor with whatever spirits determine fate and will protect them from harm and misfortune. Taking another's totem is a grave insult, made worse if the thief goes on to wear it openly, but being given another's is the sign of a lifelong, unbreakable bond and often goes hand in hand with swearing oaths in blood.",
							"Bugbears also place great importance on collecting the heads of enemies they have slain. Some believe that the spirits of the dead remain in the heads, and will become the bugbear's slaves in the afterlife, others simply enjoy the respect and fear their collections inspire. Regardless of the intent, the sight of a bugbear warrior's hut with dozens of smoke-dried heads (each of which he will proudly tell you the story behind) nailed to the walls is enough to make an impression. Bugbears will engage in night raids against rival tribes and other monstrous races to add to their collections, and gain extra esteem if they can sneak in and return with a head without raising an alarm."

Sometimes,the tribe lives within a settlement itself, secreting themselves in catacombs, cellars, and back alleys. Smaller settlements, where it would be more difficult for the bugbears to pass unnoticed, might have a hidden tribe of the creatures at the town limits without their knowing. While some tribes adapt to a more 'civilized' way of life, keeping their thefts to food and supplies, others, particularly those inhabiting the so-called 'shadow towns' on the outskirts, keep to their old, savage ways. It is not uncommon for these tribes to treat a settlement as nothing more than another forest, and the people within as game.

They carry strange totems; many-limbed monstrosities out of half-remembered nightmares which, it is said, grant some of them the power to slip inside the minds of sleepers, or even bring death upon those in their own dreams.",
									"When traveling through bugbear and other goblinoid controlled lands, the Khuunkleff act as a reminder that none of their kind should think themselves above fear, for it is fear which keeps goblins safe. With a short spell of terror, they are reminded that there is always something more powerful than themselves, and they must be ever vigilant. The bugbears may not ever be seen by those they visit, but enough campfire stories exist that every goblin knows what a period of vivid nightmares, mysterious visitations and unexplainable deaths means.",
									"If their travels take them close to civilized lands, a few of the Khuunkleff sell their services as assassins. While this is frowned upon by the tribe's elders as a cheapening of their traditions, it is not expressly forbidden, given that they are still spreading fear in their own way. They excel at eliminating political rivals where an outright assassination would be obvious and fingers would be pointed; the Khuunkleff utilize more subtle methods, infiltrating houses, waking sleepers with eerie noises, displaying bloodstained mementoes of family members which are found clean and in their proper place if another investigates, convincing the dwellers of hauntings or madness. If this continues for a period of time, the victim's potency as a rival is removed; they are either too worn down to maintain any political support, descend into madness,or are even driven to suicide. The bugbears are rewarded, and the power of fear is demonstrated.",
									"Members of the tribe are awarded titles, so named for their particular specialities. Kuurdwur ('Dreamwalker') is unrivalled in convincing unwary sleepers that they are being watched and followed, Sibwuurd ('The Whisperer') is a master of mimicry, tormenting victims with voices and sounds deeply buried or considered long-forgotten, and Oonfuus ('Unease') sows seeds of disquiet, breaking trust, suggesting untruths and forcing misremembrances that leave those who thought themselves safe in their beds wondering who they can trust upon waking."

									"Years of warring with a well-supplied, well-trained, and ruthless foe can really only go one way for a tribe of bugbears. Typically few in number, individualistic, and scornful of asking for aid from others, the bugbears will normally be forced into hiding or fleeing. In the Kruudruun ('Rootless')' case, the choice was made for them when a local noble, weary after years of bugbear raids on his town and skirmishes on his roads, ordered the forest burned to the ground.Those who fought the invaders were killed in battle or forced back into the flames, but the lord gave the elders and the young a chance to make their escape. In the following days, the survivors hunted,trapped, and sacrificed their totems, vowing revenge.",
									"With none among them of fighting age, the diminished tribe wandered through plain and mountain, habitats unfamiliar to their kind. Tiluan, second to the tribe's previous elder and already respected by his broken brethren, took up the position of leadership, guiding his foundlings and kin through the seasons.When they could, they took shelter in forests, even joining other bugbear tribes for a time, but always wary of testing the bounds of another tribe's terse hospitality. Occasionally, young and hotheaded bugbears would journey on with them after such a stop,and so their numbers began to regrow. The youngsters grew into warriors, honing their skills on any traveler unfortunate enough to cross their path. The most notable of these has become the defacto war chief of the original youth, named Keentaaf ('First Blood', in the common tongue) who slaked his blade with the blood of an entire merchant caravan the day he came of age.",
									"Now, their numbers regrown, their warriors blooded, the Kruudruun march for home, burning farmsteads and raiding villages in their path, melting away before reinforcements arrive.No bugbear tribe has marched for war in living memory, yet the Kruudruun seem to have developed a taste and a talent for sustained open combat beyond their usual guerilla ambushes, and their size, strength, and determination certainly gives them an advantage over the small garrisons guarding these minor settlements."

									"The Taza Hwu ('three clans') is a huge plains clan, made up of several hundred gnolls of three separate groups united under the savage claw of Zausra'a, declared Hwu'uat, queen over all gnolls. Too large to be constrained to a single territory, The Taza Hwu roves the land, recognizing no borders and seeing all gnolls as Zausra'a's rightful subjects. Zausra'a's vision of a united gnoll race is a terrifying prospect, but all who have stood against her have been swept aside, with not a trace of them left for the crows. ",
									"Years ago, after a brutal battle with the Shield-Biter orc tribe, Zausra'a's pregnant mother, Vitizi found herself alone, and clanless. As she prepared for a lonely death, she had a dream of hyenas picking over the bones of the world under the shadow of a gnoll with three heads. ",
									"Zausra'a killed and devoured all three of her siblings, one in the womb, one on the birthing mat, and on the day she took her first steps (chasing down her sister who learnt to walk the day before). Her mother took this as an auspicious sign of greatness in her future. On the eve of her third birthday, they journeyed to a gathering of clans feasting in the ruins of a city sacked by orcs. Her mother declared for all to hear that Zausra'a was Hwu'uat, and that all must fall in line or challenge her claim. She faced the leaders of the three clans present in single combat, Grazzar of the Aohkar, Kikizi of the Drra, and Tzoma of the Haumt'ki, beating them to the ground and biting off their noses to mark their defeat, but allowing them to live to serve as her personal retinue, a duty they perform with near-fanatical loyalty. ",
									"Zausra'a scorns the males of the clan, permitting none in her presence and threatening with death any who dare to speak when she might hear it. It is whispered by some that she prefers the company of hyenas at night, and they point to the large numbers of crocotta accompanying her as proof. Her mother is the only one she will allow to question her decisions but, even so, in recent years her influence is waning over her increasingly unpredictable daughter.",
									"Those who have observed Zausra'a's rise to prominence watch The Taza Hwu with caution; while she lives, the united clans are a nearunassailable threat and a death sentence to any village which falls in her path. However, the inevitable power vacuum when she dies could drench the land in even more blood and chaos. "

					"{@i A sound resembling a child's giggle distorts hideously into an inhuman, whooping call that reverberates through abandoned buildings of old stone and thatch. The dirt and dust of the narrow street has been churned and trampled with fresh blood by panicked feet. A stooped figure lopes from the shadows, licking its salivadripping, bloodstained chops. A smell of rot emanates from it, a stagnant charnel-stink of old blood and old flesh caught between yellowing fangs. It takes a moment to thread the ragged stump of a finger onto the twine looped around its thickly muscled neck. Its notched ears twitch at the faint sound of a cry and, hackles raised, it surges towards the origin. This is a gnoll. }",
					"With their strong ties to the clan, gnolls are most likely to take to adventuring having been raised from a pup by a mercenary or someone of a similar life. Gnolls raised by a clan may find themselves alone if the clan is wiped out, or if they are banished for a betrayal, and might be forced to interact more peaceably with other races to keep their belly full. ",
					"Gnolls retain a strong instinct to physically dominate others, even those they are allied with, to work out a hierarchy. Despite this, they are fiercely aggressive of their established 'clan', even non-gnolls, and see an insult or an attack on any 'clan mate' as a personal one. They tend to be impulsive, with a strong predatory drive which may lead to them to engage or pursue an enemy even when it may not be the best tactical choice. Most gnolls continue to collect trophies from their kills, although they tend to avoid body parts while in more civilized company if it is against the will of their 'clan mates'",

Settlements that have fallen to gnolls are easy to identify; they leave no bodies as evidence of their attack, even clumps of grass where blood has been spilled will be ripped up and devoured. ",
							"Gnolls craft nothing of their own; they subsist entirely on what they can take from others, and scavenging is the central pillar of gnoll culture. Gnolls have no currency, and don't place an inherent value on items beyond ownership; a tin cup a gnoll stole or took by force will have far more value to it than a whole chest of gold found by the wayside. Gnolls will typically keep a collection of items taken from their victims, sometimes coins or something similarly ubiquitous, but far more often body parts, with ears, hands, and scalps being the most common trophies. ",
							"To a gnoll, the clan is everything. Individuals may disagree, fight, or even kill each other, but the good of the clan comes before all else. While outward aggression is encouraged, subterfuge and betrayal are great taboos in gnoll society and incur the harshest punishments: more often than not, execution by ritual cannibalism. Children of the clan are raised communally, with most adult clan members contributing to their education and growth. ",
							"This innate need to be part of a clan means that gnoll pups raised amongst civilized races can become fiercely loyal to the 'parent' who raised them, though they will keep a vicious nature, and a desire to assert physical dominance. For this reason, gnoll clans are occasionally targeted by slavers, aiming to kill the adults and sell the pups to the highest bidder (generally for bodyguard or gladiatorial services), although this often ends badly for the slavers in question. ",
							"Shamans form the spiritual center of gnoll culture. Usually the oldest female, and often the mother of senior clan members, the shaman imparts the will of the gnoll gods to the clan, as well as performing rudimentary rituals and rites, including healing and simple divination, generally fueled by a great deal of blood. Many shamans possess abilities similar to lycanthropy: they can change form to that of a large hyena at will, allowing them to hunt with the pack and travel at speed. These abilities are the result of grisly rituals centered around the desecration of graves, and consumption of disinterred corpses, preferably those of notable virtue in life. ",

The slaves caught by the gnolls are primarily traded with a group representing the Brabus family, a powerful family of dark elves who dwell in the unfathomable underground depths. In their excavations and expansions, the dark elves are, unknowingly, nearing a subterranean altar (of unknown but ancient origin) dedicated to Bowda, and a constant supply of fresh slaves ensures that, sooner or later, they will stumble across it. Should the dark elves, with their predilection for demon worship, discover and make the proper sacrifces at the altar, Bowda's full power shall be unleashed on the world",
