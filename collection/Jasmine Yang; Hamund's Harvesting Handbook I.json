Blacksmiths craft and fix all manners of equipment ranging from farming equipment, to weapons, to suits of armor. Not only that, but while blacksmiths normally deal strictly with metal, many creature shells, bones, and scales require metal reinforcement and/or attachments before they can be used as weapons and armor. As such, even though they are organic materials, it is still primarily a blacksmith's responsibility to craft with them.",

I have spent many years writing down my findings and anecdotes, and I now present them to you less seasoned adventurers so you may soak in my wisdom.",

It provides a loot table for every single unique monster in the 5th Edition Monster Manual. These loot tables are easy to reference and contain every piece of information your players could need when they tear their fresh kills apart. It also possesses over 200 new and unique craftable items to be made from your harvesting adventures, and all the information you would need for them. There are of course rules for both the harvesting and the crafting, and a few extra goodies strewn in here too.",

												"The rules for hags is the same as that of disasters: they're dangerous, they're best to be avoided, and they tend to come in threes. Harvesting a hag is also a dangerous proposition as contact with their bodily fluids carries the risk of contracting the dreaded '{@disease crone's disease|HHHVI}.'

										"Perhaps reflective of their spiteful nature in life, hags continue to display an unmatched level of vindictiveness even in death. Upon their death, a reaction takes place immediately in the bodily fluids of a hag that makes them a vector for transmitting \"{@disease Crone's Disease|HHHVI}.\" Whenever a creature imbibes any bodily fluids from a deceased hag, they must succeed on a {@dc 15} Constitution saving throw or become infected with {@disease crone's disease|HHHVI}. A character whose harvesting check fails to harvest anything from the hag also runs the risk of contracting {@disease crone's disease|HHHVI} as they clumsily splash blood in an orifice or in an open wound.",
										"Upon contracting {@disease crone's disease|HHHVI}, 1 of the victim's facial features/body parts immediately transforms to look more hag like. For example, their nose may become hooked, or their hands become claw-like. Every 24 hours, the victim may attempt the saving throw again. On a success, the disease ends, and every 24 hours subsequently, 1 transformed feature returns to normal. On a failure, another facial feature or body part changes to become more hag-like, and the disease continues. Every 7 days, any currently transformed feature becomes permanent even after the disease is cured. At that point, only restorative magic such as that of the spell {@spell greater restoration} may return the creature to their normal appearance.",

On the other hand, if you are going to him for {@optfeature Tinker|HHHVI|tinkering work}, then you could not be in better hands. A smarter gnome I have never met, and his inventions are so fantastical that he blurs the line between mechanical and magical.",
														"Although Jarrod tends to keep to himself and wiles away the years performing experiments in his laboratory, there are times when he becomes overwhelmed by unexplainable feelings of wanderlust. When these episodes arise, Jarrod inevitably hits the open road on his customised wagon/workshop, ready to make new inventions with whatever fresh materials he finds."

										"{@i Q: Why didn't you include the meat you can harvest from creatures?}",
										"A: I wanted to avoid relatively generic harvesting materials. Largely I assumed that DM's would be able to judge meat harvesting by themselves without any need for a guide."

										"{@i Q: Can I change an item to suit my campaign?}",
										"A: Feel free to do so. Items were designed to be setting agnostic and able to fit into anything, but edge cases could always occur. I encourage DMs to use this guide as a launching point for their own ideas."

										"A: To be honest, they do not. The updated Artificer class was released very late into the development of this guide and as such, this guide does not incorporate them at all. A future update may attempt to reconcile them."

										"{@i Q: Why don't you include the beast section?}",
										"A: I felt that beasts were too mundane to include in the harvest table, and largely could be replaced by a DM googling an actual butcher table."

								},
								{
									"type": "entries",
									"entries": [
										"{@i Q: How come you didn't include any loot like weapons and armor?}",
										"A: Those items are largely context sensitive. After all, not every {@creature Hobgoblin|MM} walks around with a {@item spear|PHB} at all times, so I felt best to leave those out and up to the DM to decide based on context."
