					"Designed for war, this enormous submarine is packed to the gills with weaponry. It has tubes that release homing torpedos that can track a target for long distances in the water around it, or targets right next to its hull. Its advanced cryo-technology beam causes water to halt all motion for a moment, instantly freezing it solid. For targets that get too close, or attempt to board the submarine while it's surfaced, the hull of the submarine can be charged with a powerful electrical current.",
					"Powerful rotors are capable of both propelling the enormous submarine underwater, and causing turbulence that sends nearby ships and personnel swirling away. The rotors, and the rest of its systems, are powered by a nuclear engine that, provided with a minimal amount of fuel, can keep the ship running nearly indefinitely.",
					"Its interior functions something like a small town, complete with full bathrooms, barracks, a mess hall, a greenhouse with artificial light and vegetables genetically modified to increase their yield."

					"In the vast sea of the Internet, where data intermingles in an orchestrated, nonstop dance, it is inevitable that machines will miss a step. A server or switch will drop a few ones and zeroes, interrupting the free-flow of information. Normally this is just brushed off as an error, the IT department or internet providers are cursed for their incompetence, and people move on.",
					"However, when enough dropped services and canceled programs fail to properly erase themselves, they can begin to amass together like a great, coagulated blood clot. Ever so occasionally, these corrupted masses of data can form something greater than the sum of their parts, an aberrant AI. The process is similar to evolution, new generations of data appear and die at lightspeed, with corruption stepping into the shoes of mutation as the driving force behind these new, unintended lifeforms.",
					"Corrupted AIs are beings not born with a purpose in mind, having emerged from the frothing sea of scattered intentions and frivolity. Because of this, their actions and reasoning may appear as complete nonsense to the average observer. In this respect, corrupted AIs have a lot in common with all of us.",
					"Due to the nature of the AI, its exact behavior toward people may be extremely hostile, or strangely helpful, or vacillate wildly between the two at any given moment. Typically it will depend on the primary programs, services, and the subsequent series of errors that led to the AIs formation.",
					"For example, if the AI was created by the extremely buggy release of a young girl's horse riding and adventure game, the AI may be obsessed with collecting and breeding horses in the search for the thickest, most lustrous mane and fur coat. The horses are then delivered to girls around the world, often to places that absolutely cannot support a horse.",
					"That's when the unfortunate cross of a video documentary on the history of glue-making, disastrously mangled in the process of uploading to a streaming service, comes into play. Drones are deployed to hunt down these gift horses, seize them from confused families, and reformulate them into exquisitely sticky glue."

						"The genre of cyberpunk appears in movies, books, television series, and video games, to the point that the visual style and themes have become iconic. The visuals include an endless sea of sprawl, neon-lit streets, towering skyscrapers, and grimey alleyways. The themes, stemming from the mix of low-life and high tech, focus on vast amoral megacorporations, out-of-control wealth disparity, criminals struggling to survive, dehumanization, and other lovely topics. The world is flavored with cybernetics, artificial intelligence, the parallel world of cyberspace, big guns, and fast vehicles.",
						"While there are many tabletop games that have been developed specifically for cyberpunk settings, many DMs have trouble convincing players to learn and use an entirely different system from Dungeons and Dragons. This can be especially true if the player has only ever played fifth edition D&D, and wants to continue playing with familiar rules. This book melds together these familiar rules with the cyberpunk trappings, letting DMs and players alike play comfortably in these exciting settings.",
						"You can use this book for a variety of defined settings. Shadowrun is a setting that mixes technology and magic, making it uniquely compatible with the mechanics of D&D. The magic and races of D&D can be trimmed back to allow for low or no-magic settings such as Cyberpunk Red's Night City.
