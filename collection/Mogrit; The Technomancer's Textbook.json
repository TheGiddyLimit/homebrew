					"The internet is deep, dark, and full of things beyond our imagination. We'll likely never know all of the horrors that lurk within its depths, and that's a blessing. Still, if you're this deep into this book and, against all odds, still reading the flavor text, perhaps you'd like a glimpse.",
					"What happens to an avatar when a user is killed while their psyche is still in VR space? Having been cut off from the source of its identity, it ceases to function, stopping all motion and expression like a puppet with its strings cut. In more established hubs, like online shopping networks and forums, the avatar will eventually have its data swept away and filed for deletion. On less civilized networks, the avatar may instead be allowed to... linger. ",
					"The avatar is composed of its user's psyche, with all the most recent activity and thought processes being duplicated from brain to machine. If the user were to suffer an accident, or worse, be murdered, their last thoughts may be of pain, regret, and hatred. These emotions may fester within the avatar as drifting notions and directionless feelings. Sometimes, though, when the last thought that passed through the avatar's processes was a call to action, such as the burning desire for revenge, then the avatar may be reanimated by these powerful feelings.",
					"This is the most likely reason behind an undead AI's existence, but it is hardly the only one. Powerful necromantic magic may be able to infuse an AI with its energy. Occasionally, a wealthy technophile will attempt to gain immortality by uploading their memories and psyche to a machine, only to find that something went dreadfully wrong with the process."

						"The genre of cyberpunk appears in movies, books, television series, and video games, to the point that the visual style and themes have become iconic. The visuals include an endless sea of sprawl, neon-lit streets, towering skyscrapers, and grimey alleyways. The themes, stemming from the mix of low-life and high tech, focus on vast amoral megacorporations, out-of-control wealth disparity, criminals struggling to survive, dehumanization, and other lovely topics. The world is flavored with cybernetics, artificial intelligence, the parallel world of cyberspace, big guns, and fast vehicles.",

This can be especially true if the player has only ever played fifth edition D&D, and wants to continue playing with familiar rules. This book melds together these familiar rules with the cyberpunk trappings, letting DMs and players alike play comfortably in these exciting settings.",

An AI that suffers defeats that cost it a large portion of its resources may be reduced in scale, piece by piece, until what remains is no immediate threat to anyone."

												"{@bold Core AI.} Destroying the machine containing an AI's core destroys the AI itself, unless it has more than one core. Even then, the loss of a core is a devastating blow for an AI, and cause for its scale to be reduced. As an example, think of HAL 9000 from 2001: A Space Odyssey slowly being shutdown by removing HAL's core modules one by one.",
												"{@bold Roaming AI.} These AIs are more tricky to destroy, especially as they grow in scale. A roaming AI can enter or leave a local network in minutes, or more slowly if it wants to make itself difficult to detect. Higher scale AI, typically 6 or higher, can separate its functions and processes into redundant pieces and commit only what it thinks it can afford to lose into a risky excursion.",
												"Still, if one can cut off or quarantine the entire AI, you can destroy it by purging it from the system while it is trapped. For the higher scale AI, you can trap or purge the local portions of the AI's consciousness and prevent it from returning to the AI's primary consciousness. This can damage the AI and cause it be reduced in scale, as well as cause it to forget memories and access keys."

							"entries": [
								"When running chase scenes, racing scenes, or vehicular combat on a highway with other non-combat vehicles driven by civilians in the area, it can be difficult to manage so many different vehicles. Moreover, with such high speeds, it can seem jarring that between turns where the drivers can catch up to each other, they are more than a hundred feet apart when narratively they are racing along at nearly the same speed.",
								"For these situations, its recommended to use ambient speed, or the speed at which all relevant vehicles in a scene move in the same direction on the same initiative count. For example, when playing out a chase scene on the highway, you can say that the ambient speed is 60 feet.",
								"On initiative count 20, all of the vehicles in the scene use 60 feet of their movement speed to proceed in the same direction, or in the direction of traffic. If you're using a map or a grid on an 'endless road', this might mean that no movements need to be made at all for the vehicles. The remaining movement can be used on the driver's turns for movement as normal, such as the remaining 70 feet of movement from a motorcycle's speed of 130.",
								"On the other hand, creatures not on vehicles, having been pushed off or gotten out of their vehicles do not move. Drivers can also make a choice to attempt to break out of ambient speed and try something fancy, or try to move against the flow of traffic. This may require a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check from the vehicle for this fancy driving, at the DM's discretion. Failure, or moving to a place in front of another vehicle may possibly result in a crash if the vehicle would move into another vehicle or creature with their ambient movement speed. It can create fun moments where a creature is pushed in front of some random vehicle on a highway, and have that vehicle's momentum from ambient speed crash into the creature."
