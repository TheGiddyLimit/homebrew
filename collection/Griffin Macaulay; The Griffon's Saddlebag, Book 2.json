This event is called Synthesis, and it's through this process that the fragments of life held by ooze and skeleton can come together to form a complete whole.

When you do, a magical, spectral door slowly appears in front of you over the course of 1 minute, duplicating the effect of the {@spell Mordenkainen's Magnificent Mansion|PHB|magnificent mansion} spell with the following change. The dwelling always includes a large library that magically includes copies of books, scrolls, maps, and more. The library does not count toward the total amount of space created by the spell. Its contents are strangely organized and seemingly change each time the key is used. A creature can visit the library and attempt to uncover a piece of knowledge, such as ancient poetry, the history of a forgotten kingdom, or the family lineage of a tyrannical king. The GM determines the checks and DCs needed to locate a given piece of information. For example, a book of foreign nursery rhymes may be easy to find, but a copy of necromantic research documents would be extremely difficult, if not impossible.",

				"This ebony charm is decoratively shaped into a fox's head and is always slightly warm to the touch. It measures 4 inches across and weighs 1/2 pound. If the charm is placed in a sufficiently hot fire, such as in a campfire, forge, or oven that fills up to a 10-foot cube, the charm begins to glow red-hot and creates a harmless, but comfortably warm, fire elemental in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the fire. The elemental is in the form of a fox and can't move farther than 100 feet from the fire in which its charm is kept. The elemental's singular goal is to supply this fire with fuel. If the fire begins to burn out, the elemental will search the surrounding area for fuel that isn't being worn or carried.",
				"The fox uses the statistics for a {@creature cat|MM}, except that it's an elemental instead of a beast, is immune to fire and poison damage, and understands {@language Common} and {@language Primordial||Ignan} but can't speak. The elemental has advantage on ability checks to find fuel for its source fire and sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. It can carry fuel back to the fire as normal, provided that it's appropriate to the elemental's size. If the elemental drops to 0 hit points, touches fire, or its source fire goes out, it vanishes and the charm grows cold and dark again until it's placed in a new fire."

Each cube appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you or adjacent to another cube you create as part of this action. The cubes are translucent objects that have AC 10, 20 hit points, and resistance to acid damage. Creating a cube in a space smaller than 5 feet across causes the cube to squeeze and fit the space. A cube remains for 1 minute or until it's reduced to 0 hit points, after which it dissolves into a puddle of slime and vanishes.",

On a 1, the gem on top of the staff shatters and is destroyed, creating a gelatinous cube in its place that's hostile toward you. When this happens, the staff becomes a nonmagical quarterstaff."

				"This spinning metal sphere is 6 inches in diameter and weighs 5 pounds. You can tap the orb twice as an action to activate it. While activated, the orb records basic details about the space that it can see within 100 feet. The orb has {@sense darkvision} out to 100 feet, but can't see through heavily obscured areas or illusions. Tapping it twice again deactivates the orb.",
				"The activated orb can display its recorded maps. If you are within 30 feet of it, you can speak its first command word, followed by a description of a location it's mapped. For example, you can command the orb to recall the entrance to a series of catacombs you explored 2 days ago, or the path you took to get through a twisting labyrinth. When you do, an illusory map appears in a 5-foot sphere centered on the orb that shows basic details about the recorded area, such as buildings, pathways, roads, signs, topography, and trees. While you're within 5 feet of the map, you can use a series of intuitive gestures to change the map's rotation, displayed location, or scale: showing as little of the recorded area as a 25-foot radius, or as much as a 1-mile radius. Speaking the command word again causes the map to vanish.",
				"If you are within 30 feet of it, you can speak a second command word as an action to make the orb rise into the air and float no more than 5 feet off the ground. The orb hovers in this way until you or another creature grasps it. If you move more than 30 feet from the hovering orb, it follows you until it is within 30 feet of you. It takes the shortest route to do so. If prevented from moving, the orb sinks gently to the ground and becomes inactive.",
				"You can speak a third command word as an action, followed by a location name, while within 30 feet of the floating orb to cause it to move on its own. If the named location has been recorded by the orb and is within 1 mile of you, the sphere moves on its own and floats up to 10 feet ahead of you, guiding you to the named location using any of its recorded maps of the area to guide you. Once you reach your destination or speak the command word again, the orb begins to follow you again."

As such, they are thoroughly loyal companions so long as their trust is maintained, and are absolutely impossible to dissuade once a course of action is decided upon. The Primeval Cerberus appears to leave his followers on a long and loose leash, allowing or forcing them to follow their internal sense of direction and purpose.",

Those rare few daring or foolish enough to face Vaanor must face his mighty breath attack, made from the raging fires of hell and the souls of the damned.

It is a city wholly dedicated to open trade, the acquisition of wealth, and the crafting of exceptional goods. The numerous artisans keep order amongst themselves with guilds: powerful factions that vie for influence over the city and its extensive trade opportunities. At the heart of this tangled economic web, The Mercantile Guild acts as administrators and ambassadors that keep the peace between the various guilds, manage the local government, and curry favor with the common folk with honeyed words and clever schemes.",
								"Within the city, virtually any material good can be found for a price from the right merchant or crafter. The city's size and population make it an ideal locale for complicated plots and intrigue in your campaign, as well as a potential origin for one or more of its characters. At any given moment, each guild is likely to be planning, implementing, or benefiting from a conspiratorial political or economic maneuver against their fellows. Each guild and their powerful members have their own motives and goals, and in Antronec, even the most kind-hearted and charitable facade can belie machinations of thievery, assassination, and other stratagems. Adventurers, in particular, have many options, such as partnering with Antronec's powerful guilds, joining the city's organized adventuring agencies, or attempting to forge their own path to success.",

Odors of in-progress and completed products often blend with each other in a peculiar symphony, such as the scent of fried delicacies mingling with freshly-oiled leathers and metals. Conversation is difficult outdoors, as the tireless street barkers and merchants try to pull attention away from the general buzz of trampling feet and sounds of production.

There's almost always at least one caravan traveling on one of the four major highways that connect the city center to the quieter farmlands and pastures outside the city's borders. A closer look at the streets and people is overwhelming, as each individual and building visually shouts for attention with bright and clashing colors, patterns, and outlandish fashions. Even worse, most of the buildings and skyline are crowded with painted billboards and banners of all shapes, sizes, and styles. These advertisement boards and the city's general preference for bright and shiny things even affects the interior and exterior designs of the city's architecture\u2014what type of decorations and building styles are in vogue often changes overnight.",
												"Most portions of the city's surface are awash with the varying and rich scent of metals, wood, herbs, baked goods, potent spices, and other vibrant smells produced by the city's numerous craftsmen. There are clashing sections where the tanneries and forges produce harsher odors, but those neighborhoods usually have larger concerns. Venturing into the city's sewer system, on the other hand, assaults the olfactory senses with the waste of a vast populace and plenty of underground denizens that call those tunnels home.",
												"Antronec is a city that's as noisy at night as it is during the day due to its size and culture, which usually requires new visitors some time and effort to adapt to. Evening workers create sounds like the clanging of hammers on anvils, the shattering of stone, the shouts of merchants, and other grating effects. Some areas are affluent enough to have buildings insulated from the sound, but most simply adjust and carry on. Those who struggle with the noise are able to cope by commissioning noise-canceling enchantments like {@i sirensong silencers} or similar items.",
												"The competitive energy that pervades the city streets is almost palpable, as the merchants vie for consumer attention like a never-ending auction house. At every turn, every purchase, a buyer has dozens of choices to make regarding quality and quantity, level of expense, and so forth. The city's usually balmy and temperate weather contributes by encouraging mobile, outdoor market stalls for many salesmen, though the most successful ones can afford permanent locations and advertising on the city's numerous billboards."

										"The city of Antronec is a sprawling metropolis, but it wasn't always this way. Founded at the crossroads of two newly-built roadways, typical craftsmen and merchants began to set up shop and service travelers. With few nearby resources besides herd animals and small farms, trade and frugality governed the growing hamlet. Faced with an unexpected and unusually difficult winter, some of the artisans began to barter their services\u2014for instance, the weaver's fabric clippings being used by the cobbler to insulate both pairs of shoes to keep their feet warm. Come springtime, these mutually beneficial trades began to be drafted as contracts, and gradually became oriented more towards efficiency than mere survival. Their collective skills produced better goods and rapidly attracted more merchants and crafters as the town continued to grow. Similar-skilled tradesmen organized small, exclusive guilds that required little investment but provided little in return.",
										"Eventually, Antronec reached a size that required peacekeepers to mediate the guilds' growing grudges and rivalries. A traveling group of clever merchants formulated an idea. They offered their services as a neutral party capable of evenhandedly resolving disputes and conflicts, which were gratefully accepted. As they expanded their influence, they desired more\u2014so they proposed a further modification to the city's structure that would formalize and consolidate the numerous guilds into a more manageable number. What these newly formed guilds did not realize was that this purportedly neutral Mercantile Guild was in the perfect position to guarantee their permanent status as administrators on top of the other guilds.",
										"Under the subtle influence of this leadership, Antronec blossomed. These cunning administrators appealed to travelers and citizens alike by providing entertainment, and utilized their honeyed words to keep the peace between arguing guilds just enough to divert and distract them from their often underhanded activities. They also quickly realized that their unsupervised contracts, letters, and even publicized theatrics offered an excellent means of concealing and transferring secrets and cypher: perfect tools for espionage and the manipulation of public opinion. Using their charm and economic savvy, as well as their darker machinations, the Mercantile Guild soon expanded their bureaucratic network to begin organizing into specialized departments, ensuring their control over the city's water, youth, military, and so forth.",

They also coordinate the city's judges, recordkeeping, banks and mint. Career politicians, they direct public opinion and mediate guild tensions with their charm and cunning.

They also take commissions for elaborate and gem-studded inventions at their business, Everbloom's Ingenuity.

The Quicksteps, Brewmeister Jefan the male gnome and Grand Innkeeper Wren the male goblin, manage the ritzy Antronec Hotel and mediate any guild disputes. Several years ago, a disastrous fire at the hotel took Wren's life, but was successfully resurrected with the aid of some precarious magic. The originally female gnome was brought back to life in a male goblin's body, which was both miraculous as much as it was challenging. Wren took some time to work through the learning curve and get used to being male, let alone being a goblin, but steadily gained confidence as the loving couple worked through the adjustments together. This period of personal growth and development directly contributed to the devoted couple's professional rise in standing within the guild, as they pioneered new ideas and renovated the flame-scarred hotel.",

												"By far the most populous adventuring agency, The Talent Ticket, led by Captain Kellybelle Flintfang, is the current favorite of {@book The Cartographer's Guild|GriffonsSaddlebag2|3|The Cartographer's Guild}. Obtaining membership with this agency is exceptionally easy, but the tradeoff is a large percentage tax and few benefits other than the large number of quest contracts. As a result, this agency's membership experiences frequent turnover. Flintfang will occasionally offer to accompany adventurers, sharing her considerable knowledge and unique skill sets; she utilizes a mixture of martial and magical abilities.",
												"Some whispers in Antronec claim that The Talent Ticket has some sort of collusion with The Cartographer's Guild to win more contracts, but so far, those that make such claims have mysteriously vanished. In reality, there is a particularly grim deal in place between these two organizations, wherein the Talent Ticket purposefully sends over-enthusiastic adventurers on lethal quests, alerting and allowing the Cartographers to follow behind and profit from their likely demise, or finish off the successful but weakened party."

										"{@b The Sellers' Slums} are a sprawling portion of Antronec made up of countless twisting and turning alleyways full of shadows and cutthroats in equal measure. An eerie silence hangs overhead, as wary eyes behind ramshackle stalls and carts offer their wares. In general, the less attention that's drawn to oneself, the better. Every proffered hand obscures its true intent, serving as a distraction for larceny or robbery just as often as vital assistance or honest sales. Few of the merchants in the Slums are guild-sponsored, subjecting them to punishing taxation from the Mercantile Guild. This, in conjunction with a proportionately low guard presence, results in rampant criminal activity throughout the Slums.",
										"{@b The Bazaar of Wonders} is where most artisans and guild-members set up their shops, with barkers calling out from brightly decorated stalls and storefronts. This section of Antronec is marked by flapping banners, bustling crowds, and well-kept cobblestone roadways courtesy of the fine masons of Bricks and Mortar. Some guilds even place their center of operations within this portion of the city, most notably {@book Metallurgy Incorporated|GriffonsSaddlebag2|3|Metallurgy Incorporated, Smiths Guild}, the {@book Hospitality Collaborative|GriffonsSaddlebag2|3|The Hospitality Collaborative, Brewers Guild}, and {@book The Lumber Company|GriffonsSaddlebag2|3|The Lumber Company, Carpenters Guild}. The residential portion of the Bazaar services Antronec's middle class with many small homes and apartments, usually above or behind the merchant's storefront.",
										"{@b The Gilded Quarter} hosts Antronec's upper class, especially high-ranking members of the Guilds. It has a large guard presence, exquisitely maintained streets and landscaping, and architecturally stunning businesses. Permits for street vendors are absurdly expensive, so the Quarter is quiet and peaceful. Extravagant window dressings display the craftsmanship and creativity of Antronec's artisans. The city's elite and most of the guilds operate from within stunning manors found here. Secreted away behind closed doors, various permanent teleportation circles can be found here, although they are zealously guarded and known to exist only by their respective guilds' high ranking members.",

										"Long ago during the Clash, the evil Legate {@creature Malfuriel the Betrayer|GriffonsSaddlebag2} led his Crimson Legion to battle in the Syre Wood: a strategically-located fey forest that, if conquered, could sway the tides of war in their favor. The legion's relentless army of martial imps and devils took the forest by surprise, quickly slaying the fey and razing the villages in their path as they made their way to the heart of the wood. In a final act of desperation, the forest's lord, Syre, managed to land a debilitating strike on Malfuriel at the cost of his own safety. As he plunged his sword into the Legate's back, he was struck down in turn by the invading legionnaires. While the fiends' shrieks of triumph echoed through the wood, Syre's final curse took hold: binding the legionnaires to the Syre Wood and turning Malfuriel to stone.",
										"That night at dusk, Malfuriel's petrified body suddenly erupted, releasing a foul wave of blood that tainted and stained the Syre Wood\u2014a blight born of his intense hatred of the fey. Gushing waves of Malfuriel's blood swept through the wood, corrupting the beasts that lived there and twisting its plantlife into a grim husk of its former beauty. Protected by Syre's blade's aura, the area immediately surrounding Malfuriel's statue was spared from his lasting corruption: creating the {@book Verdant Heart|GriffonsSaddlebag2|3|The Verdant Heart} at the center of what is now known as the Bloodmire.",
										"To this day, the Legate's thousands of oath-bound servants are afraid of Syre's blade and magically warded from entering the Verdant Heart. Trapped in this cursed swamp by the sword's powerful magic, these fiends have slaughtered every fey that dared step outside of the Verdant Heart, and eagerly await their leader's eventual return.",
										"Over time, the Legion managed to repurpose a handful of magical fey orbs, warping their magic to serve the legionnaires' needs instead. These protective orbs originally warded the Syre Wood's fey villages from divination magic, but now serve to mask the appearance of nearby fiends: disguising them as simple humanoids instead. The {@creature Crimson Legion imp|GriffonsSaddlebag2|Crimson Legion imps}, which are by far the most common fiend remaining in the Bloodmire, appear as simple halflings when in range of such an orb. An orb has AC 20, 50 hit points, and resistance to all damage. Fiends within 1 mile of an orb are disguised by its magic.",
										"To visitors, the insular 'halflings' of the Bloodmire are kind enough: offering to heal those afflicted by the Bloodmire's diseases for either coin or in exchange for the wings of a sprite.

Shopkeepers explain that they would fetch the wings themselves, but the devious sprites know them too well, and have placed magical wards to deny them access to the Verdant Heart. These are expertly crafted lies told to further the Legion's goals, but a successful {@dc 20} Wisdom ({@skill Insight}) check reveals that something about these statements is amiss.",

The monastery often has a misplaced reputation among those that know of it for being haunted by vicious spirits. Stories of wailing specters and resident undead shroud the monastery, as well as those who practice there, in a veil of ominous mystery and fear.

										"Long ago, passing through the Field of Graves and scaling the Spires was considered a nearly impossible feat, only to be attempted by the most daring or equally foolhardy of climbers. The few who abandoned their ambitions early enough to return home would tell stories of ghostly spirits that haunted the dark forests and perilous cliffs. Those that pressed on, despite the natural (and unnatural) dangers that plagued the range, were solemnly referred to as Grave Climbers: a somber reference to the nature of their death as well as the foolishness of seemingly knowingly climbing into their own graves.",
										"Eventually, one such climber succeeded and reached the apex of the tallest spire within the range: a human man by the name Attiskin. According to his recorded legacy, the climb was enlightening and offered him a chance to rediscover himself and find a greater purpose. Compelled to stay within the range, Attiskin painstakingly eked out a living atop the harsh peaks, managing a tentative relationship among the ghosts that he came across and doing what he could to ease their eternal regrets. Over time, Attiskin's ability to guide these wayward spirits grew, and the number of ghosts within the range began to dwindle. As a result, the forest and mountains became markedly less dangerous for traditional travel, spurring a new wave of athletes to attempt the journey. These bold climbers and other curious souls were the first to discover the hermit Attiskin.",
										"In his time in the spires, Attiskin had lost his mortal sight but gained newfound wisdom, insight, and understanding of mortality on the Material Plane. Many of those that listened to him felt a spiritual kinship and would either stay for a short while or, in some cases, months. Those that stayed with Attiskin for extended periods of time worked together to create a series of structures that, over time, has become the Durheim Monastery.",
										"After taking the title of Lightseer, Attiskin charged his followers to safeguard the ethereal presence of the spires and provide solace to the souls that cross over to the Material Plane. In doing so, they were also given the responsibility to defend other visitors and travelers within the range. Over time, such defense of the spires became redundant, and as a result, Durheim monks will now, at some point in their training, embark on prolonged missions to find and provide succor to other lost souls around the world. Other, more dangerous ethereal threats are instead hunted down and forcibly rid from the Material Plane. This dutiful pilgrimage is known as {@book Walking the Liminal Path|GriffonsSaddlebag2|3|Walking the Liminal Path}, and it plays a pivotal role in a Durheim monk's personal spiritual journey. Although the monks of Durheim and the Field of Graves have a well-deserved reputation for dangerous spectral happenings, they also serve as a flicker of light in the darkness for those who understood the terrors of the dark to flock toward.",

Most festivals take place in more pleasant weather, but the backdrop of a summer sun or autumn chill is a vital part of these celebrations. Here as well, the sense of connection and camaraderie between each soul is strengthened and precious memories are made.",
												"Regardless of the specific menu, taverns and festivals are never complete without their food and drinks. Some serve quality, perhaps even magical, cuisine; others focus on comfort foods and large, sometimes excessive, quantities of alcohol. When a warm meal or drinks with friends are required, there's no place better than a tavern or festival.",
												"By their very nature, most taverns are built with similar floor plans that provide open areas for tables and booths, a bustling kitchen, and space for customer lodging. In contrast, most festivals are inherently transient, designed to pop up in an open space for a time and then packed away at the close. In both cases, however, much can be learned about a tavern or festival by observing the condition and construction of the building or tents."

Many dwarves in the city are wealthy enough to dwell upon the highest steppes, where comfortable accommodations are available within the mountain's warm, stone walls. Most traditions in the city are still based on dwarven culture, placing great importance on honesty and hard work, and continue to use the Dwarvish language for legal documents and fiscal contracts. The city outside the mountain feels open and exposed to the world's grandeur, while managing to remain safe from its dangers thanks to the city's numerous watchtowers.

The designs are usually simple with harsh angles, but their quality is unmistakable as they stand resolute after centuries of use. More recent additions vary far more.",

As a result, the city's geothermal hot springs are extremely busy, and the populace adopts heavy coats and thick clothing to ward off the cold. By contrast, the warmer months rely heavily on the insulation of the primarily stone buildings to evade the blistering sunlight, all the closer and stronger due to the altitude.

However, shortly after their departure, civil war between the kingdom's elite clans caused the nation to devour itself from within. Cut off from all other resources, the six clans stubbornly held their ground against the onslaught of nature and weather, carving out a home upon the mount. When all seemed hopeless and it appeared all would perish from lack of air and biting cold, their prayers for divine aid seemed to be answered. From beneath the dormant volcano sprung cascading pools of hot water, making their permanent settlement possible.",

The clans divided their responsibilities based on their cultural strengths, allowing their numbers to grow in size and resourcefulness. Eventually, this led to the formation of the Steel Hawks: an elite force dedicated to protecting the growing outpost against threats from the outside world.",
										"As the outpost continued to develop, eventually becoming large enough to be considered a small city, it needed to change its system of governance in order to adapt. This gave way to a uniquely competitive and wealth-based system of government: a direction far removed from the traditional means of dwarven rule. Enterprising dwarven families saw their wealth and success grow, accumulating power and influence, but ultimately forced many of the lower caste dwarves to leave the city or move outdoors\u2014a first for many of their kind\u2014in search of better opportunities. This large exodus of skilled but otherwise aimless artisans led to the mining, development, and colonization of the city's first steppes. Further, with outdoor living conditions now possible on the mountain, merchants, refugees, and travelers from neighboring regions were able to scrape out a meager living and foothold in the developing city.",
										"In addition, a number of exceptional smiths began to congregate in the city, seeking to harness the mountain's geothermal heat in pursuit of the finest tools, weapons, and armor. The most successful of these smiths proved to be a group of humans and elves who, when forced to cooperate in order to compete with powerful dwarven artisans, devised startling new advancements in their craft. Through working together, these smiths discovered the secrets necessary to craft unique silver eagle weaponry, advancing the Steel Hawks' martial prowess and ensuring that the Silver Eagle Forge Coalition became a wealthy and influential part of the city's politics."

Traditionally, a commanding general presides over any number of captains, who in turn manage up to three platoons of ten Steel Hawk soldiers each. Initiation into the faction requires rigorous training and testing of mind and body, but is notably simple in its one and only oath\u2014to protect Heavensteppe and its people.",
										"With watchful eyes, the Steel Hawks leap across the skies with an unexpected grace, launching themselves with supernatural speed into the air to reach otherwise inaccessible heights and adversaries. In the defense of Heavensteppe, no enemy\u2014humanoid or monstrous\u2014has yet withstood their collective might and valor. Unlike many similar factions, the Steel Hawks work hard to keep themselves free from foreign politics and complicated situations, making them a Neutral organization as a whole. They do not operate as a group beyond the city-state's borders, though many adventurers depart from their ranks to pursue their individual quests and endeavors.",
										"Unparalleled in aerial combat despite their lack of true flight, the Steel Hawks' unique combat style almost seems to be more of a performance than a threat\u2014until their foes find their wings clipped. Indeed, many songs and stories are told far and wide of the enthralling 'dance' of a Steel Hawk. In stark contrast to their swift and smooth movement, Steel Hawks maintain a balance of overall strength and dexterity, capable of jumping just as high and far while unburdened as they can fully armored and equipped for battle.",

For many decades, it has operated solely based on the charitable donations of the community, providing its services regardless of an individual's social or economic standing. The Heart Medics provide this selfless service under the leadership of Head Medic Noella Gustarson, a female elf greatly beloved by her patients and staff.

Leaders alone are aware of Elson's connection to the Thousand Voices, and by extension are forced to forge a similar pact with the Soul Vortex. Using this shared magical connection, Leaders are able to carry out the directives as given by Elson, although many simply rely on the wants of the Thousand Voices directly.

								"The city of Magmarath is a black-iron metropolis lining the flaming maw of a massive volcano of the same name. Found in the hellish Lower Planes, the city has grown into a strange nexus of law and chaos bound by a common creed: the value of anger. Unified under this shared ideal, the city serves as a home to both demons and devils\u2014two fiends of typically diametrically opposed moralities, as well as other fiends with more relaxed notions. Here, under the watchful eyes of the Tribunal of Wrath and their Magma Militia, the city's laws are enforced with ramifications imposed by a mixture of law and chance. The famed Iron Maw Arena colosseum serves as a place of unlikely respite from the heady political and moral conflicts that rage across the planes, allowing visitors to instead focus on what really matters: sating their desire for honest cruelty and violence through endless\u2014violent\u2014entertainment.",
								"Also known as The Cauldron, Magmarath presents a ferocious challenge to travelers from the Material Plane, both in and outside the Arena. Although its fiendish denizens aren't usually openly hostile to mortals, many may be tempted to give into their impulses and take a chance with any ramifications that come from such transgressions. Even members of the typically orderly Magma Militia follow their natures around such visitors, taking great pleasure in fighting, eating, or finding reason to force their participation in the colosseum. Despite these hazards, Magmarath holds great value as a destination, allowing comparatively mundane humanoids from the Material Plane to gather mighty weapons, enlist unique services that can easily traverse the planes, and, potentially, test their mettle against the elite in the Arena.",

It begins to work faster, charged by the additional energy, increasing the sound of its grinding gears to an almost deafening decibel. A passing group of vaguely distinguished fiends, armed militia members, stop to inspect it briefly before carrying on their way. The sharp scent of ozone mixes with the everpresent sulfur of the volcano, the sheer pressure of the rising heat, the goosebump-inducing static charge, and an undercurrent of barely-contained violent impulse all serve to demonstrate just how bizarre this city is. Compared to settlements of the Material or Upper Planes, Magmarath seems determined to make dwelling here as harsh and unforgiving as possible.",

The volcano's presence is visible through the open, grated walkways built outwards from the igneous rock. Besides the many fiends above, some of the grated streets reveal denizens flying or walking below or ascending the sides of the metallic buildings, as their magnetized footsteps clank against the metal. Hulking machines squat on the edge of the streets, grinding and clicking to fulfill their myriad purposes\u2014shifting the city's walkways and buildings in a haphazard layout, and occasionally getting supercharged by the volcano's ash-cloud-generated lightning.",
												"The city's constant upwards breeze carries the rank odor of brimstone, sourced from both the volcano and its fiendish inhabitants. The occasional lightning strike adds a temporary spike of ozone, and some sections of the city are marked by the presence of singed hair and the pungent scent of both cooking and burnt flesh and blood.",
												"Although difficult to hear because of the numerous whirring machines, the city is very active and punctuated by sundry voices. Wails of trembling pain accompany cackling laughter as well as roars of triumph and gleeful conversation. With good ears or in proximity to the violence that usually spurs these sounds, the sizzle of blood or flesh upon metal can also be heard.",
												"Merely stepping foot in Magmarath subjects creatures, especially ones from the Material Plane, to overwhelming heat and hungry stares. An undercurrent of tension prevails, as though every inhabitant is on the verge of releasing years of bottled anger. Outside, the frequent lightning strikes and machinery create passing waves of static charge that ripple outwards, causing gooseflesh and frizzing hair."

The Tribunal of Wrath resolved to establish and sponsor a grand colosseum, the Iron Maw Arena, where their bloodlust could be sated. With these systems in place, the city grew to tremendous prominence\u2014which many creatures across the planes viewed as a threat. After repelling a vicious invasion from a group of fey warriors led by the archfey Syre, the Tribunal entrusted its founding Tribunal member, Legate Malfuriel the Betrayer, with ancient blood magic before unleashing him and his newly created Crimson Legion upon the fey's wooded home, the Syre Wood.",

This Tribunal has also increased the numbers of the city's militia in the years following Syre's attack, formally organizing them as the Magma Militia. The militia is composed of all manner of fiends, however, and as such its members are just as likely to instigate lawbreaking as they are to apprehend criminals."

The rarity of mourningsteel means that only the oldest and most experienced smiths of Magmarath know how to shape it.

This means that all travelers to the Border Ethereal are forced to come well-equipped with their own supplies of food, water, and other goods they'll need on their journey.",

Of course, as with everything throughout history, life and magic will often claw their way into even the most remote corners of the multiverse, and the Border Ethereal is no exception.

												"The plant grows as a shrub with dim purple leaves and small white flowers. Most grow to be about 3 feet tall by the time they reach maturity, although some varieties are known to grow taller. A tuber, oemmock's roots resemble a common potato from the Material Plane that has only a fraction of the flavor, but typically offers a wider range of nutrients when eaten. Most oemmock reaches maturity in a year but can be harvested for its roots after only four months. Planting an oemmock seed is as simple as releasing it while your hand is underground.",
												"Oemmock leaves can be reduced to produce a foul-tasting mash or drink called oema, and with age can become mildly alcoholic. When grown near water, oema becomes progressively more clear and flavorless, offering a precious means to collect extra moisture on the Border Ethereal. The material remains of the leaves are spun to weave a silk-like fabric called wylle (pronounced nearly the same as \"wheel\") and are often dyed using the oemmock's flowers, whose colors change depending on the minerals it has access to from the Material Plane. Similarly, the barky stalk of the oemmock can be crushed and processed to make planks of wood from its stringy pulp and tough exterior. It's using these materials that buildings and clothes can be fashioned on this otherwise barren plane of existence, providing the majority of what little resources natives to this plane have access to. Structures made from oemmock can't be traveled through like ones on the Material Plane, and as a result, are highly sought after. Similarly, thanks to its trans-planar nature, an oemmock structure remains in place when pushed against if it's affixed to a nearby support on the Material Plane, such as the ground, a tree, or other building.",
												"Varieties of oemmock often serve as a settlement's greatest asset or even, on occasion, export. Some oemmock is grown that sacrifices its edible roots to instead pull in more water from the Material Plane, and can be tapped like a tree to collect and release water into the Border Ethereal. Other varieties have been grown to maximize the amount of bark and pulp that are collected when the plant is harvested, and others still are cultivated to grow thicker or richer potato-like roots. These cultivated plants are highly sought after, and as a result, are also the most closely guarded part of any settlement you can find on the Ethereal Plane."

												"Most ethereans are raised to believe that the struggles of the Border Ethereal pale in comparison to the dangers found elsewhere. In doing so, most of them grow up with a shared sense of kinship with their fellow ethereans and respect a traditionally honor-bound system of law. Within larger settlements, etherean peacekeeping is more tightly enforced by a punitive system of governance, with most sentences resulting in outright branding and banishment.",
												"In general, ethereans have an advanced appreciation of privacy. On the Border Ethereal where virtually everywhere is traversable, having a shared sense of decency and respect has kept the culture and its people from destroying themselves from within. As a result, most ethereans raised on the Border Ethereal are lawful, but like any humanoid, are capable of evil or good.",
												"Despite their typical law-abiding nature, many ethereans also enjoy setting pranks; perhaps as a result of common etherean entertainment relying on the lives of creatures beyond the Border Ethereal, or even a leftover trait from a potentially old fey heritage. Such pranks are typically harmless and are always in the spirit of good fun. Classic examples include placing an oemmock plank within a door located on the Material Plane or leaving a small cup of water suspended in the air just in front of the face of a sleeping etherean. This cultural bend towards the harmless and silly has also led to a history of outlandish names for its regions and towns. Similarly, when an etherean comes up with a nickname for someone, whether it be for a creature on the Material Plane or a fellow etherean, it's almost always intended to be frivolous.",
												"Fashions among ethereans will also change depending on their location. Most clothes are made from wylle, although clothes from the Material Plane are highly coveted for either their scarcity or raw materials. Oemmock flowers are frequently cultivated to produce vibrant colors, and in some cases can create even metallic or iridescent sheens when used as dyes. These colors play heavily in the culture and vivacity of etherean settlements, as well as form pivotal components of their trade. Against the otherwise colorless Border Ethereal, these shocks of welcome color provide a backbone for the ethereans' appreciation of art and theater, allowing for artists and craftsmen to earn comfortable livings making paintings, costumes, and other vibrant fashion.",
												"While most ethereans speak Common, secondary languages and unique details of etherean subcultures depend largely on who their neighbors are across the veil on the Material Plane. Settlements that neighbor dwarven mines are likely to speak Dwarvish and develop similar interests, whereas an etherean settlement in proximity to a dragonborn metropolis may adopt different traits. Similarly, while religion isn't a widespread practice on the Border Ethereal, those that do practice it tend to follow the deities worshipped by their Material neighbors."

Unbound by gravity or conventional restrictions like temperature or available land, etherean settlements can exist wherever they have space and access to valuable resources like oemmock or mourningsteel. Buildings can be easily built above the ground, as their material weight is irrelevant, provided that the structures can be kept in place against the force of whatever footfalls might walk on them.

												"The following are a few examples of etherean settlements that can be placed into your campaign.",
												"{@b Fiddlewren} is an etherean settlement that takes advantage of the breathability of ethereal water, being built entirely on and in the ocean along a rocky, mineral-rich coastline lined with oemmock farms whose flowers produce beautiful, glowing pigments. The ethereans here are fascinated by and mimic the fashion of the ocean's brightly colored and bioluminescent inhabitants. Architecture is similarly designed to showcase the majesty and mystery of the sea. Even compared to other etherean villages, Fiddlewren is reclusive, using their self-sufficiency and underwater isolationism to provide detachment from the violence that so often plagues the surface of the Ethereal and Material Planes.",
												"{@b Novrembroark} is a scattered collection of homes placed by the Ethereal Nexus in the Daruuhma Spires on the Border Ethereal. It's here that ghosts are ushered back into the Material Plane to find their eternal solace at the hands of the monks at Durheim Monastery, although only an elite few are aware of the ethereans' hand in their work. While the work performed by the ethereans of Novrembroark is important, it's through the collective effort of countless other etherean settlements that ghosts are slowly shepherded there from across the Border Ethereal to be safely released away from etherean civilization.",
												"{@b Orostead} is remarkable in that it is one of the only non-etherean cities to ever be found on the Border Ethereal. The mages of this lake-top city once channeled their tremendous power to shift it in its entirety from the Material Plane into the Ethereal, avoiding an impending danger there centuries ago. Ever since, when calamity seems imminent, the city has been known to transfer itself back to the Ethereal Plane for safety. While there, Orostead maintains friendly relations and trade with their etherean neighbors, though their stays have never been long enough to warrant establishing any permanent or regularly scheduled commercial networks. Part of this uncommon relationship is to secure their city's safety while on the Border Ethereal. Since the city only needs to be shunted into the Ethereal when it's already in peril, the mages of Orostead know that the sudden introduction of a city's worth of resources into the Border Ethereal could easily tempt the often resource-deprived ethereans nearby to form raiding parties and endanger the welfare of the city in new and unexpected ways. To prevent that worst-case scenario, the city is generous with its materials and supplies whenever it crosses back into the Border Ethereal, causing the plethora of etherean settlements surrounding Orostead to be more well-equipped with resources from the Material Plane than most.",
												"{@b Shimm} was established in a particularly arid and sandy desert. Although inhospitable on the Material Plane, the Ethereal mists and fog make Shimm a most unusual oasis. The region is rarely visited, so most who would even attempt to see it from the Material Plane find only mirages and hints of something beyond. Specialty oemmock found here gathers more water than normal with its unusually deep and scraggly roots. Tapping its stalk, like a tree for its sap, causes the plant to release any stored water it has inside.",
												"{@b Twerthberg} was initially formed as a refuge from the otherwise omnipresent dangers of the world's deepest and darkest caverns. The predators of these underground caverns are terrible, but very few can threaten the city's inhabitants on the Border Ethereal. To that end, many ethereans view Twerthberg as a zoo of sorts, where one can observe the unfamiliar dangers of such an environment from complete safety. The settlement is strategically placed by large, luminous patches of bioluminescent fungus that provide the area with the bulk of its light.",
												"{@b Valentas} rests in an expansive, snowy tundra. The relative emptiness of such a snowy landscape is fascinating to ethereans, who view this settlement as a meditative place away from the passive but chaotic bustle of the Material Plane. As a result, Valentas experiences more turnover than most etherean cities, as pilgrims and artists of all kinds journey to and from the settlement's austere environment. Oemmock farmed here produces wylle that's especially rich, but grows food that's even blander to the taste than traditional varieties.",
												"{@b Xyzz}, pronounced \"Zizz\", is an etherean settlement nestled within an existing Material metropolis. Its people use the structures and buildings of the existing city as their own, living their lives almost entirely in parallel to the ones of those on the other side of the planar veil. Oemmock grown here is almost exclusively for consumption and fabric and has been cultivated to produce more food and oema than traditional varieties."

										"As Orostead's standing as a refuge for the magical grew, so too did its need for a level-headed leader: a Speaker. Rhaj Grintin, a plain and compassionate human fisher, was the first to be given this title. Tasked with the responsibility of leading the town through sweeping cultural and logistical changes, Rhaj was successful in bridging the cultural and fiscal gaps between the village's citizens. Years later, it would be Candace, Rhaj's own daughter, who would be the second to be given such a responsibility. Generation after generation, Rhaj's descendents have continuously been seen as admirable leaders deserving of the Speaker's title. The process for electing a Speaker is well documented in Orostead's history, but has never actually been performed by the city. As a result, while the city is governed by the Speaker and members of a chosen noble council, Orostead is commonly considered to be led by a benevolent monarchy.",
										"The current Speaking family of this monarchy are Queen Adelin and King Harold. Harold, a direct descendent of Rhaj, shares the responsibility of Speaker with Adeline, whose infectious charisma and compassion are an ideal compliment to Harold's more quiet and studious demeanor. Known for her passionate speeches and charity efforts, Queen Adeline is a Speaker of the people, while King Harold finds balance and drafts new laws to support both people and prosperity: a Speaker of propriety. Between the two of them, this Speaking family has focused its efforts on ending homelessness and hunger throughout the city: a difficult task given the city's limited space. Within The Pale Palace, Harold and Adeline are aided by several noble families, the {@creature Pegasus Knight|GriffonsSaddlebag2|Pegasus Knights} (see {@book appendix L|GriffonsSaddlebag2|15|Pegasus Knight}), and representatives from the city's numerous other agencies.",
										"Though the Spire's wizards are vital to the protection of Orostead, they've never been turned to for its governance. However, they are asked from time to time to aid in the accomplishment of otherwise less feasible endeavors, such as the magical production of food and lodging to support refuges due to war or famine.",

												"Her Majesty was royal, but in name only. Her compassion for the daily struggles of common folk was made clear by her visits to local markets and fisheries, as well as the unsupervised nights spent in the local taverns. Raised by a single stalwart father, a pegasus knight without a trace of nobility, she was given the perspective of two worlds: one of the mundane dangers of average life, and the real dangers of martial law.",
												"At the age of 15, her father was killed by a rampaging dragon in the line of duty. Wracked with anger and spite for the people who led him to his death, it was only then that she realized the impact he had on the royal family. The sitting king and queen, as well as their son, paid her a visit to offer their sympathy and support: an early act of kindness that would shape her growth from her father's loss.",
												"Moved to noble studies and quarters, she grew to befriend the young prince. Time passed, and as is typical in stories such as this, the two fell in love. Set to become the future queen of Orostead, she spent her days studying the nobility, law, and history of the city. Using her meager upbringing as context for her opinion, she could see that many generations of corruption and ill-practiced law threatened to consume the city and leave it a husk of its former glory.",
												"But the prince grew sick before their coronation. Too sick. One night after reading to him in their bed, she fell asleep. She tossed and turned with nightmares of plague and ruin. Just when she could feel the last of her hope begin to slip away, a light broke through to rid her of the darkness: a shimmering pegasus with the horn of a unicorn.",
												"It was there that she bargained with the spirit. In exchange for some of its divine power, she would ward off the darkness that threatened to consume them. When she awoke, she found a feather and horn clutched in her hands.",
												"From then on, the would-be queen nursed her prince back to health, learning the extent of her magic as she went. The prince survived, although his legs would no longer serve him. The two were crowned king and queen, and while the king could often be found in his study or poring over new laws or the grievances of his people, the queen became the voice of the city and its people."

								"The Upheaval was a dark era of time that spanned the course of one hundred years and was marked by the violent persecution and suppression of spellcasting humanoids. Led by a faction of fear-mongering paladins called the Justicars, this war against the arcane was fueled by fervent slander and aggressively divisive propaganda designed to strike fear into the hearts of the nonmagical. Using this manufactured fear, the Justicars continued to expand and control vast swathes of territory by mobilizing groups of radicalized civilians. Inquisitions ran rampant and often led to the wrongful conviction and execution of innocent people, magical or otherwise. Powerful magic wielders themselves, the Justicars were both feared and respected for their firm grasp and discipline of their power, and despite their abilities, were considered the only acceptable purveyors of magic in the eyes of their followers.",

Though these zealots are far less in number and power today, their tyrannical actions have caused tremendous suffering for decades, even following the Upheaval, and still strive to accomplish their repressive goals.

The Justicars thrive on the persecution of mages and flounder in their absence, forcing their organization to rely on a tight grip of martial law and propaganda to control the populace and perceive threats that may or may not exist. Even months after the Justicars pass through a region, some remaining elements of their presence can still be felt.",

Mass graves and rotting corpses are common in the wake of a struggle, often caused in equal measure by the apprehended mage and the Justicars themselves.",

Heavy tariffs and taxes deter merchants, forcing civilians to struggle finding or creating their own forms of subsistence. Town-wide rationing and curfews are common, although higher-ranking Justicars never seem to lack leisure and other luxury goods.",

Their militias use their sanctioned arcane skills to craft bunkers, walls, and moats in mere days using the materials at hand.

When a number of these elite paladins grew drunk with the power they held over other spellcasters, conflict began to brew within their Order. When a resolution proved unattainable, the Spelldrinkers banished the offending members, and were, for a short time, forgotten.",

Using the connections they'd made from their time in the Order of Spelldrinkers, the Justicars proceeded to influence noble houses, governments, and other powerful organizations with infectious propaganda. Over time, these powerful connections began to support the Justicars, who claimed that their leadership would see to it that all people could lead lives free from the threat of dangerous magics, and deliver a world of equality to those unable to wield magic for themselves. With the financial backing of powerful noble houses and other organizations, the Justicars began campaigning for laws and regulations prohibiting the use of magic, declaring that failure to do so would serve as a testament to the subservience of the nonmagical. When their demands were unmet, the Justicars used their practiced charisma and fear-mongering tactics to whip impressionable citizens into a frenzy, rallying them against their magical neighbors and a perceived corrupted government. Using these two-pronged approaches to control the actions of both governing officials and the people that they led, so began the Justicars' crusade to rebalance the scales of power in their favor."

Making these items used both my designer and illustration sensibilities, and I loved the feedback (good and bad) that I received online from similarly passionate 5e fans.",
						"After a week of making them, I started to realize how much fun I was having and how my creative and emotional health were improving as a result of it. My partner suggested that I make an Instagram account for it and turn it into a 365 project: that is, making one a day for a year.",
						"Now, she knew as well as I did that I had never seen a 30-day art challenge through. So to suddenly jump into a 365-day one sounded pretty out there. She then upped the ante and said that I could probably even start a Patreon for the project if people seemed interested. Again, pretty wild.",
						"In general, I have a hard time saying no to a good challenge. This one, in particular, was largely a matter of willpower. The only person I could blame for not following through on it would be me, barring anything extraordinary happening. Also, I thought to myself, I could put every item into a book and be an author, which all sounded very exciting.",

								"Making work you're proud of is also how you can accept creative feedback with grace. If you want something to be as good as it can be\u2014which you do, if it's something you want to be proud of\u2014then you're much more eager to listen to people when they have differing opinions than you. Humility is an important trait in any aspect of your life, and this is a great way to naturally keep yourself in check."

								"Assuming that you want to build an audience, this is important to consider. If your end goal is just to make something for yourself (which is great), then you can keep whatever schedule makes you the happiest. But if you want to turn a passion project into something more, make sure that you can keep a consistent pace with it. If you can find a schedule that works for you over a long time, you'll be in good shape. If you subject yourself to a schedule that's too demanding, you run the risk of burning out, and if it's too lax, you or your followers can lose interest. Self care is important to maintain a schedule, so be sure to have a support system in place.",
