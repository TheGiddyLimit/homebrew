A wind blew from nowhere, and leaves began to rise in a whirlwind centred on the puppy, which slowly rose into the air, eyes still locked onto the larger dog's gaze. Then, as it turned in the gentle cyclone, the puppy transferred its attention to Thaia. Now there was something different in its expression - something intelligent, and as their eyes met, Thaia felt a jolt of recognition, and connection.",
								"Abruptly, the wind died down, and the puppy plopped back onto the forest floor.",
								" It turned and once again regarded Thaia with that new thoughtfulness, then it turned back to the larger animal.",
								"\"What is your name?\" The Taimavar asked.",
								"\"Flint\" answered the puppy.",
								"\"Flint, will you follow me, and learn to be a ranger, and in time, become the Taimavar for this village?\"",
								"\"I will\"",
								"Both animals stood, and headed towards the edge of the clearing. Just before they vanished from sight, the larger dog turned and looked  at Thaia.",
								"\"Thank you Thaia,\" said the Taimavar. \"We will see you both next moon.\""

								"A gibbous moon hung in the sky, glimpsed occasionally through the thick canopy. The sounds of the day had been replaced by the noises of the night. Snufflings, grunts and the snapping of twigs spoke of a family of boars on one side whilst on the other side the near-silent sweep of wings through the air and the tiny squeaks of unfortunate rodents betrayed the presence of hunting owls.",
								"Noting, but ignoring all this information, Freja padded through the forest, following the trail she had been tracking since early that morning. The small amount of light from the moon helped her eyes little, but that was not the sense she was using. Instead, the forest spoke to her in a million different, tiny ways. The earth through her pads\u2013the damp leaf litter disturbed in the patterns of footprints that didn't belong, the ruffle of breezes in her thick fur telling her of movements on the path far ahead, the droplets of rain containing scents of unwanted intruders. She knew from all of these clues that the party she tracked were goblins, a small number, and that their weary body scents spoke of travel, rather than raiding. Still, she followed, ready.",
								"Freja paused at a broken branch. With a whisper, she healed it, the shattered fibres knitting back together, and the sap flowing once more. Further on, there was the trace of spoor, where the creatures had defiled the ground underneath a bush. Freja tugged at the thoughts of detritivores, guiding them towards the foul mess, encouraging them to dig in underneath the soil, where it could do some good, rather than pollute the air. Further on, Freja found the remains of a fire, and also of several unfortunate forest creatures that had been the basis of the intruders' meal. She spoke a prayer over the remains, sending their souls towards a better place, and with another word, sent the charred sticks deep into the brush where at least the ashes could fertilise new growth.",
								"At last, Freja came upon the goblins, snoring and muttering in sleep. The watch-taker nodded, failing at his task. Freja settled down to watch\u2013she would ensure that these creatures left the forest no more damaged than they had found it, and if necessary, ending their lives before they could do too much harm. As she settled her muzzle on her paws, she became one with the forest, its protector, its child."

After a minute he'd satisfied himself that, no, the camp wasn't under attack, it was the dream that had awoken him. It was the same every night - he dreamed of his raven haired mistress, his goddess, the one who both protected him and corrected his mistakes. It was the thought of her that pushed him onwards, protecting the party with his life every day, his dark fur hiding charges from the shadows, his ferocity terrifying even the most hardened of human warriors, the relentlessness of his attacks often turning the tide of battle in favour of his comrades.",
								"The thought of his party brought him fully awake, and he crawled out of his bedroll, shrugged into his finely-crafted armour, and trotted off to make his rounds, checking each of the sleeping forms in turn.

Come for your cuddle?\" Without further warning, the halfling pounced on Hartley, wrestling him to the floor and knuckling his head. Hartley briefly considered biting the halfling's little finger off, to teach him some respect, but instead allowed himself to enjoy the embrace for the smallest of moments before snarling and wriggling away. \"Touch me again, thief, and I will retaliate!\" Hartley gathered his frayed dignity, drawing himself up and thrusting his chin out. \"Where's my breakfast?\" he growled."

Slowly, they both turned to face the dog, which sat, still humming, then started to slowly thump its tail on the dusty ground. The men couldn't seem to remember what they had been so worked up about, and even started to recall why they had been friends for so many years - too many, surely, to ruin both their lives with such a pointless skirmish.",

								"As Altaar and Morgaine left the Tailor's shop, attracting even more attention now that Morgaine was properly garbed, she reflected on the last few years with, even now, disbelief. She had been an unremarkable member of the Sorcerer's household, although unusually devoted to him, to the point of spending every hour, waking or sleeping, at his side. She had closely observed the practice of his art, the power surging through him, rigorously contained, controlled and channelled. Although she knew not to interfere with his practice, curiosity had overcome her one day, and she had inched forward, and simply sniffed his hand during one of his spells.",
								"It had been as if something huge had awakened inside of her. She remembered yelping with alarm, as intense power had surged through her small body, lifting her off the ground with its raw energy. But, even as it threatened to consume her, she remembered some of the words that her master used, and inexplicably now able to speak them as clearly as him, had brought the chaos under control, slowly returning to the floor, and back to her dumbfounded Master. Morgaine chuckled to herself - this was the only time, before or since, that she'd seen him lost for words as he gathered her into his arms in concern.",
								"After they had both absorbed Morgaine's sudden and unexpected new abilities, training her had been an obvious next move. She had eagerly and quickly progressed, and today was the day they revealed her existence to the Conclave. They approached the elegant stone building, and passed into the imposing foyer. Altaar paused, and knelt down in front of Morgaine, pulling something from his pocket.",

Golden rays filtered through the fretwork of the window coverings, tiny dust motes dancing in the light illuminating the soft, embroidered pillows and artfully draped silk hangings. Nightingale reclined against her little sofa watching her mistress and master as they laughed and conversed and sipped iced sherbet, or played with the tiny birds with their bright plumage as they sang in their piping voices in their silver cages. Servants slipped in and out, tending to the needs of Nightingale's master and mistress, and her too, as the treasured pet of these two beautiful humans, the young and happy couple. They brought her titbits of lightly roasted meats and delicately peeled fruits, and sometimes her mistress even fed her with her own hands, if Nightingale's tricks - standing on her hind legs and yapping in time to the hidden musicians' tunes - pleased her. At these times, Nightingale was so happy to please her kind mistress, to be so loved, so cared for.",

This wasn't visible, however, through the fretwork in the windows of the prison cell that she and her mistress dwelt in. Their room was decorated with costly fabrics, sewn by half-blind children, draped across bare walls of a room that contained nothing that could be used to do harm to oneself. That pleasure was reserved for their master, who visited in the late afternoon, and usually stayed until late in the evening. At these times, Nightingale's mistress desperately tried to please him, telling stories and dancing to the hidden musicians, and commanding Nightingale to show off the tricks that her mistress tearfully begged her to learn in the early mornings, feeding her the scraps that she'd saved from her own rations. Nightingale's love for her mistress kept her blind to all of this though, until the evening with the shouting, and the screaming, and the final crash. The next morning, Nightingale crept out from under her sofa, shaking and whining, but her mistress would not be awoken.",
								"Nightingale opened her eyes once more. She would not relive this night the desperate escape, the weeks of wandering, starving and crying, the arrival at the temple and begging scraps from petitioners with her tricks and her adoption by the monks, slowly learning their ways. She would instead reflect on the morning she awoke at the foot of the huge statue with new thoughts, thoughts that replaced her grief with calm, and a new determination to protect all who were in need of it."

His target lurched out of the shadows, right hand clutched to his stomach round the circular handle of the knife embedded in his guts, blood and other fluids leaking through his shaking fingers.",

Tedric had wounded him sufficiently to make him think he could make it and survive, and had then melted back into the shadows to follow. Tedric had padded softly behind him all the way, privately exulting in his ability to so closely stalk his prey without detection. It was an innate skill, but diligently refined until he was almost undetectable, even by the keenest of senses. The man paused outside a nondescript door, and reached his hand up to knock. Enough. This was the place. Before the man's hand made contact with the wood, Tedric snatched another dagger from its sheath and launched it. The weapon buried itself in between two ribs and into a lung, silencing any shout the man might make to alert his comrades.",
								"Tedric finally moved into view, confronting the evil-doer, now slumped against the wall. The man regarded him with disbelief as Tedric walked up his chest, picking his way round the blood. \"but...but...you're just a...\" The whispered words slipped away as Tedric's dagger slid across the man's throat, silencing him forever.",
								"\"I may be just a dog, fiend, but I bested you, and my companions will end your gang's evil deeds for good.\" Tedric carefully retrieved his weapons, grasping the adapted pommels with his mouth, wiping them of blood, and stowing them in their sheaths.

Gaining entry to the Wizard's abode had gone exactly according to plan. Tobias had presented himself at the door of the elegant pavilion, having carefully stashed his more obviously warlock garb in a nearby coppice, with one of his spectral companions, a rangy wolf, to guard it. The wizard, an elderly Halfling with white moustaches, had happily let him in, offering him water, and calling him a 'good boy'. Tobias chuckled at the thought\u2013no-one had called him a good boy in a very long time, and certainly not since his Pact with the Hunter, the unseen claw, the howl in the night.",

								"The wizard actually whimpered, but then incredibly, pulled himself up a bit. \"You have no right to it.\" he stated firmly.",
								"Tobias cursed under his breath. Then shook his head. He was here to achieve his task. He stood up and paced slowly over to the wizard, now beginning to show a little defiance in his posture; the foolish beginnings of resistance. Tobias again fixed him with a glare, and concentrating, issued a Command.",
								"\"You will tell me the location of the amulet, fetch it for me, and place it at my feet.\" Tobias felt a familiar warmth spreading from the region of his neck, as his most precious possession, the gift from his Patron, slowly began to weave its spell. He could see the wizard fighting the Command, and he very nearly succeeded, but then he sagged, beaten.",
								"The wizard pushed himself to his feet, moved to a sideboard and shoved it aside. Reaching behind it, he made a movement that Tobias could not see, and a hidden compartment in the bookcase popped open. The wizard wordlessly retrieved an object, turned, and deposited it at Tobias feet.",
								"Tobias took it up, and without a backward glance, turned and walked away, leaving the wizard to fight off the effects of the Command.",
								"Back in the coppice, Tobias carefully placed the amulet in a pouch, and shrugged back into his light leather armour, the buckles clipping easily into place with the touch of a paw. He sat and cleared his mind, and then there it was, the taste in his mouth, the feel of the delicious morsel between his jaws. He swallowed and it was gone, but it was enough. His Patron was appeased."
