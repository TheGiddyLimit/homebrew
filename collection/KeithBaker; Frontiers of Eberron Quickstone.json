						"Five Nations. Secrets of Sarlona. Most canonical Eberron sourcebooks focus on broad concepts or regions\u2014continents, nations, the Last War. Sharn: City of Towers focuses on the greatest city in Khorvaire. In the wake of Exploring Eberron, I knew I wanted to do something different\u2014to dive deeper into a smaller region, picking an interesting point on the map where a group of adventurers could make a difference, and where they could see a town prosper (or fail!) because of their actions. I wanted to explore stories on the edge of the map instead of at the heart of it. But knowing that I wanted to tell stories on a frontier, the question was which frontier? Because in 998 YK, there are a number of interesting choices. Aundair and the Eldeen Reaches. The shard rush in Q'barra. Darguun. All of these were solid options. But ultimately, I love the nation of Droaam. I love looking at creatures that are traditionally classified as monsters and imagining the nation they could build working together. And so this book explores the region that lies between the established human kingdom of Breland and the new, rising nation of Droaam. The opportunity drawing people here isn't gold or even dragonshards. It's Droaam itself, a young nation that is coming into its own. I knew I wanted to tell a tale that draws on classic western tropes, where you could play a warforged sheriff, a small-town preacher, a retired Sentinel Marshal with skeletons in his past. But I loved that this is a place where the Ranger could be a worg and where the Bard might be a harpy\u2014where the classic fantasy elements of Breland mingle with the monstrous denizens of Droaam.",
						"Quickstone began as an adventure\u2014a starting point for characters that wasn't Sharn or Stormreach. As we explored the story, I realized that I wanted to take it further, exploring the entire region and the stories we could tell there. As it turned out, the road to Quickstone was long and hard, filled with random encounters and unexpected challenges. I appreciate the hard work of everyone who's helped us reach the end of this journey. Wayne Chang kept the project moving forward, with help from Sumeet Vats in the final stretch. Imogen Gingell brought the adventure \"Heart of Stone\" to life, as well as developing subclasses, feats, monsters, and treasures. Luke Volker refined our writing and made sure we were in line with the revised rules in the 2024 version of the fifth edition Player's Handbook, while Sam Sorensen put all the pieces together. A host of artists contributed to the book, and I'm grateful to Carolina Cesario, Matthew Johnson, Julio Azevedo, GAOZ, Vincentius Matthew, Sylverryn, Jonathan Ng, Alexandra Coggon, Olie Bollador, and Eldon Cowgur for giving us a vision of the Western Frontier\u2014and especially to Thomas Bourdon for his amazing cover and to Marco Bernardini for his incredible map of Quickstone. Marco completed this map in 2021, and I'm so happy to finally share it with the world.",
						"But there's another group of people to thank. It's taken a long time to finish the book, but for the last few years I've been running a campaign set in Quickstone for my patrons. Hundreds of people have contributed time and energy toward shaping Quickstone, and many of the NPCs you'll find here are drawn from that campaign. So thanks to everyone who has been a part of Quickstone\u2014and to you for exploring it now. And thanks to my partner Jennifer Ellis for walking from Quickstone to Silver Lake with me.",
						"As always, this book is a vision of Eberron as I run it at my table. You may find details that don't align precisely with previous sourcebooks. It's up to you to decide which version to use\u2014or to use both as inspiration for your own ideas! From the beginning, we wanted Eberron to inspire people to create their own stories. So welcome to the Frontier\u2014I hope you'll make it your own!",

						"When people think about adventures in Eberron, they often think of distant and legendary locations\u2014the jungles of Xen'drik, the dragon-realms of Argonnessen, the hidden lands of Sarlona. Others look to the great cities of Sharn, Korth, or Fairhaven, metropolises teeming with people. But there is adventure to be had in the cracks between the great cities and distant lands. In the wake of the Last War, new nations have broken away from the yoke of Galifar, and this has created a host of unique frontiers and untapped opportunities. West of Breland, a number of different cultures have joined together as the nation of Droaam. The medusas of Cazhaak Draal have opened their stone gates, the tieflings of the Venomous Demesne have emerged from their hidden kingdom, and the infamous Daughters of Sora Kell stand above it all. Breland and the other Thronehold nations have refused to recognize Droaam\u2014and this, in turn, means that Droaam isn't obliged to respect the laws and traditions of the nations of the east. And it further means that the border between Droaam and Breland is largely a theoretical concept. This has left a wide swath of land where no one truly holds sway\u2014where each village must stand ready to defend itself from brigands and raiders, where Brelish and Droaamite may dwell side by side, where Cannith goods can be found alongside the arcane creations of the Venomous Demesne. It's a region filled with ancient ruins, some of which have been shunned for centuries\u2014often with good reason. And it is a region filled with expanding cities and newborn hamlets, where people have come in search of opportunity in spite of the danger. This is the Western Frontier.",
						"All the themes of Eberron\u2014the concepts discussed in Eberron: Rising from the Last War\u2014are in play on the frontier. There is opportunity for pulp adventure, for fighting demon-fueled champions in ancient Dhakaani ruins or racing to stop nefarious cultists from releasing the deadly daelkyr. And there's room for noir intrigue, for schemes driven by petty greed and human weakness. The impact of the Last War can be felt here, as veterans and refugees settle in unclaimed lands and war criminals and deserters from the east hide from justice. But there are other themes that are unique to this time and place. This is an opportunity to explore the shifting balance between Droaam and Breland, to find mysteries in towns too small to show up on any map, to bring justice to places where it's long been forgotten. So strap on your wand and saddle up the tribex\u2014Quickstone awaits.",

								"In the distant past, the lands west of Breland were a vibrant part of the goblin Empire of Dhakaan. The Six Kings monument on the northern edge of the Graywall Mountains commemorates the founding of this empire. At that time, the region was prosperous and fertile, and networks of roads and tunnels connected a host of Dhakaani towns and cities. That golden age was torn down by the daelkyr. The Xoriat Incursion wasn't a single focused invasion. It was a series of waves, each stronger and deadlier than the last. Orlaask, Avassh, and Dyrrn sank their tendrils into the region and spread corruption and chaos. Some of these were straightforward, physical conflicts\u2014hordes of dolgaunts and dolgrims supported by mind flayers and beholders clashing with disciplined Dhakaani legions. Others were more subtle, such as Avassh's creation of rageweed, a swiftly spreading plant whose pollen causes hallucinations and enhances aggression in bugbears and hobgoblins. It's not known with certainty who caused the environmental damage, but historical records show that the region now known as the Barrens was once verdant and fertile. It could be that it was the daelkyr Avassh who drained the life from the soil... or it may be that the Dhakaani themselves devastated the land in a desperate, pyrrhic effort to contain the threat posed by the daelkyr. Ultimately, the Daelkyr were defeated, but the damage was irreparable. The psychic wounds inflicted by the daelkyr festered, and civil war, chaotic upheavals, and lingering aberrations and monstrosities tore the empire apart. Within two centuries, the Barrens were a dusty region of haunted ruins. Bugbears and hobgoblins were nearly eradicated. Goblins remained, but they were soon subjugated by the scavengers and predators that emerged from the shadows\u2014feral gnolls, hungry trolls, cruel minotaurs, and far worse things. And the daelkyr aren't the only deadly powers in this place. There is an overlord bound beneath the Barrens, a force that thrives on brutal tyranny. This Horned King fueled the cruelty of the chibs, petty chieftains engaged in endless feuds. Over time, islands of civilization arose in this sea of chaos... The Venomous Demesne. The Znir Pact. The hidden changelings of Lost. The harpies of the high peaks. But these forces remained isolated and all but unknown to the people of the east, who saw only the violence of the chibs and the monstrosities roaming freely.",
								"With the rise of Galifar, Breland laid claim to all the lands west of Silver Lake. But this was just a word written on a map. Throughout the history of Galifar, there were only a handful of Brelish towns west of the Graywall Mountains. The largest of these was the town of Stubborn, which has since become Graywall; the Church of the Silver Flame established Brightstone Keep, which has since become Grimstone. But between the harsh nature of the land and the chaotic aggression of its inhabitants, the rulers of Galifar never considered it worth the effort to fully subjugate it.",
								"Centuries passed. New civilizations arose in the Barrens; the rise of the medusa city-state of Cazhaak Draal went entirely unnoticed by the people of the east. The region was simply a land of monsters, a place for eager templars to venture on bold quests. The denizens of the region were seen as too chaotic to pose any sort of serious threat to Galifar, and the Barrens had nothing of value. Then came the Last War. Galifar shattered into five nations. And along the edges of Khorvaire new nations seized the opportunity. The Mror dwarves declared independence. The Tairnadal elves and Ghaal'dar goblins laid claim to Valenar and Darguun. And in 986 YK, the Daughters of Sora Kell sacked the city of Stubborn and issued an ultimatum to the survivors. {@i \"Tell your rulers there's a new power in the west,\"} Sora Katra told the people of Stubborn. {@i \"What you've called the Barrens, we now name Droaam. The land beyond the Graywall and below the Byeshk belongs to our people. Withdraw yours quickly and respect our claim; next time, there will be no survivors.\"}",
								"The next decade saw a series of dramatic conflicts between Brelish soldiers under the leadership of Count ir'Blis and Droaamite forces. Breland struck at Turakbar's Fist. Droaamites razed villages around Orcbone. The struggle came to an end with the Mourning. As the nations of Khorvaire came together to craft the Treaty of Thronehold, the Daughters of Sora Kell sought a seat at the table. Their petition was denied. The people of the east wouldn't accept a nation of monsters; they were certain it would collapse within a few years. But in 998 YK, Droaam is stronger than ever... and people know it. The dragonmarked houses smell opportunity. Tharashk has found dragonshards and other valuable resources. Brelish nobles are offering veterans and refugees land in this region, drawing a new wave of settlers.",

The Barrens were once an important part of the Dhakaani empire, and there are fragments of the fallen civilization spread across the region. It's possible to find Dhakaani structures that are still intact, from small watchtowers to fortress cities like Cazhaak Draal or Shaarat Kol. But more often, adventurers will encounter remnants of structures destroyed by war and the passage of time, like the chunk of an ancient wall in the town of Quickstone. Keep in mind that Dhakaani architecture usually involved subterranean structures; what appears to be a devastated ruin could have intact vaults extending deep into the earth. And these in turn could have vile spores of Avassh, gargoyle servants of Orlassk, or other relics of the forces that destroyed Dhakaan. And finally, the Barrens holds a host of more recent ghost towns\u2014villages built by Brelish settlers and abandoned in response to the rise of Droaam, or chib camps abandoned under the new order. The Barrens are vast and largely uncharted.

Do they sympathize with the Grizzlies or the Mourners? How do they feel about the rise of Main Street and the upcoming Kundarak enclave?

										"As a player character becomes wealthy and powerful, they may find some of the stories on the frontier to be less compelling. A 15th level Wizard with a purse full of diamonds won't have much trouble with a band of basic brigands. There are a few ways to handle this. The first is to shift rewards. \"Heart of Stone,\" the adventure included in this book, can carry characters to 5th level. This makes them quite capable by the standards of the Western Frontier. Moving forward, the DM could reduce XP rewards, cutting them by 50-75%; the characters will continue to advance, but slowly. Likewise, they may receive less gold than is typically assigned to the challenges they overcome. The point isn't to penalize the adventurers\u2014it's to give them different rewards. Rather than raw currency, rewards can be favors, improved reputation, useful magic items\u2014whether that's an experimental potion, a Dhakaani adamantine blade, or a golden fiddle from the Merchant of Misthaven\u2014or, potentially, Epic Boons or Supernatural Gifts. Adventurers who shatter Orlassk's cursed altar might receive a Supernatural Gift without explanation; is it a gift from the archfey King Grayfinger, a show of gratitude for cleansing the stone? Or is it the first manifestation of Orlassk's \"blessing\"\u2014which might soon become a curse?",

The point is that, as the economy of the Western Frontier operates at a lower level than Sharn or Fairhaven, the adventurers don't need a lot of gold for it to be significant. Likewise, they should feel that they are gaining useful things because of their victories\u2014but those can be favors or blessings rather than the ability to cast 7th level spells.",
										"This is an option, but it's not the only one. If a DM wants to run a higher level campaign on the Western Frontier, the challenges faced by the adventurers can evolve to match their power. Fiends could manifest through Rhesh Turakbar's Demonglass Warriors. Mordain the Fleshweaver could unleash deadly threats tailored specifically to challenge the adventurers. Orlassk could unleash a Stoneborn Tarrasque. These sorts of threats will certainly shift the tone of the campaign, but there are ways to challenge high-level characters."

A more severe injury could result in the loss of all or part of a limb; remember that Eberron: Rising from the Last War has Prosthetic Limbs! But scars don't have to be physical. A character could have a traumatic reaction to the source of their defeat; going forward, they suffer Disadvantage on ability checks or attack rolls directly related to the person or creature that scarred them. The damage could be to their reputation, as word of the defeat spreads and wherever they go, people bring up the story.

												"The Western Frontier lies between Breland, Droaam, and the Eldeen Reaches. Merchants are always happy to see Brelish coins or Kundarak letters of credit, but they're used to dealing with people from both sides of the road. Droaam has yet to mint currency. Bartering is a common practice in Droaamite daily life. Droaamite miners often trade using small chunks of precious metal or uncut gemstones. Droaamites also gamble and barter with bounty-marked teeth. The Daughters of Sora Kell offer bounties on certain dangerous creatures, paid for by the tooth. A Goblin symbol identifying the animal it's from is carved on each tooth, but most merchants won't accept teeth unless they personally recognize the tooth\u2014so you can't just carve \"wyvern\" on wolf teeth. While the DM could treat bounty-marked teeth as another form of coinage\u2014\"the old goblin offers three displacer beast teeth, worth 10 silver pieces\"\u2014adventurers who kill a dangerous monstrosity might wonder what the bounty is for their teeth. The DM could roll on the Individual Treasure tables in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide to determine the bounty offered for a creature of any CR. However, the tooth currency is based on the value the Daughters have placed on each bounty, and not every creature has a golden mouth. Some dangerous creatures might have a high value, while others are worthless. The bounty is a way to encourage the elimination of threats, and if a creature doesn't threaten the people of Droaam\u2014or is perhaps even an ally\u2014there won't be a bounty on its teeth. The people of the Venomous Demesne have their own forms of currency, including vials of blood charged with arcane energy and shards of crystalized souls; however, most people on the Western Frontier aren't willing to trade goods for a vial of pain-soaked blood."

A typical village might have a single representative of a Dragonmarked House\u2014a Sivis message station, a Jorasco healer, a Vadalis farrier, a Cannith smith\u2014while a larger town may have a few different dragonmarked heirs. Even so, there's a world of difference between the Jorasco Healing House you'll find in Wroat and the Patchery, the tiny clinic run by Daff d'Jorasco in the town of Quickstone. This can have a variety of effects. For one, the selection of goods is always more limited. In Quickstone, the blacksmith, Bel, can make you a Trident if you give her a day or two, but she doesn't have one just sitting on the rack ready for sale. And if you're not dealing with businesses licensed by dragonmarked houses, prices will often vary based on the perceived need and means of the customer. The upside to this is that you can occasionally find goods that aren't available in the standardized shops of the east. At the Patchery, Daff may only have a small supply of Potions of Healing available. But he could have a special potion he's mixed up using a byeshk infusion and a bit of what he's fairly certain was troll blood. He can't be sure what it will do until you drink it, but he thinks it's a potion of Heal. Do you want to buy it and find out? This idea goes even further in the markets of Droaam. Without the standards imposed by the Dragonmarked Houses, there's a lot of potential snake oil on the market. Some things might not work at all (\"It's not my fault! It's your thin human blood!\"); others might have remarkable effects that are more powerful than an adventurer could normally get at the price. Will they take a chance?",
												"A final point is that services may be sparse in the Western Frontier, but the Dragonmarked Houses are taking an interest. The town of Quickstone already has a Gold Dragon Inn, and House Kundarak is working on a vault enclave. Over the course of time, new services will become available, but is this a good thing? Do you actually want a Kundarak enclave in your town?"

Just because they can kill these cultists without consequences, is that the best answer? Ultimately, it's up to the DM to decide whether to encourage ruthless justice or to explore the broader consequences. When the adventurers fight a stone cult, if they do manage to keep the cultists alive and sever their ties to the cult rather than just killing them... maybe the family of a cultist invites them over for dinner in the next session. Maybe a cultist gives them an uncommon magic item\u2014a family heirloom\u2014in thanks for their freedom. Conversely, if adventurers do ruthlessly slay their enemies, they may see the consequences of Droaamite justice, as the friends or kin of their victims hunt them down, spread stories about them, or otherwise make life difficult. One such consequence is that an adventurer could be challenged to a duel. Overall, most people on the Western Frontier support dueling if the cause is seen as justified. If a wandslinger comes to town and declares that an adventurer killed his brother in a cowardly fashion and that the adventurer is currently wearing the brother's amulet, stolen from his corpse\u2014if the adventurer refuses to duel or cheats to win, they could quickly acquire an infamous reputation.

The idea isn't that a character with high Hit Points can simply laugh as someone stabs them over and over; it's that as long as they have Hit Points, they can avoid a lethal blow. Standard combat reflects the idea that combatants are dodging, parrying, and evading attacks even as they are losing Hit Points. People can and do fight challenges in the street using the normal rules of combat, which means they're dodging and moving and getting hit multiple times before they fall. But an arcane duel is an entirely different form of combat. It's about raw courage, speed, and skill: the courage to stand your ground, the speed to strike first, and the skill to land your spell. There's no dodging in a duel; you need to look your rival in the eye as you strike them down. Because of this, an arcane duel only involves a single attack from each combatant\u2014and that single blast can be deadly, regardless of how many Hit Points you possess.",

										"Dragonmarked houses and others are heading to the Western Frontier. House Orien is extending the lightning rail toward Graywall. But this is no story of Brelish colonialism. Breland isn't expanding across this frontier\u2014it's being driven away from it. Throughout the history of Galifar, the people of the Barrens were divided. The medusas of Cazhaak Draal, the changelings of Lost, and the tieflings of the Venomous Demesne were isolated city-states, which avoided contact both with Breland and with one another. These cultures were all but unknown in the east, so the dominant impression of the region was of the chaotic chib culture. The Daughters of Sora Kell brought these diverse factions together. Force was a factor in the creation of Droaam, and fear of Maenya's Fist still plays an important role in keeping the old chibs in line. But the common depiction of Droaamites as squalid villages of goblins dominated by slow-witted ogres is driven by ignorance and Brelish propaganda. Under the Daughters of Sora Kell, each of the cultures of the region is a thread of a growing tapestry. New villages and towns are rising up from the Barrens, their construction driven by ogre strength, goblin enthusiasm, and the brilliant architects and masons of Cazhaak Draal. Magewrights from the Venomous Demesne are implementing an arcane infrastructure that could in time outshine the everyday amenities of the Five Nations. Droaam is a very young nation, still finding its footing and establishing traditions. But it is growing stronger every day, and it's only a matter of time until its great cities\u2014like Graywall and the Great Crag\u2014rival Wroat and Fairhaven. And it is this that is drawing the influx of travel and trade from the east; the glimpse of opportunities as Droaam grows and prospers.",
										"With that said, it is largely in the great cities\u2014such as Graywall, Vralkek, Cazhaak Draal\u2014that this renaissance is occurring. The Droaamites who dwell on the Western Frontier are remnants of the old system of chib rule, where a family of ogres or minotaurs would dominate a community of goblins and kobolds. Under the leadership of the Daughters, Droaamite workers are assured food, shelter, and security. Today, the chibs are expected to protect their people, not to oppress them; a modern chib serves as both mayor and sheriff. The Daughters are likewise encouraging the spread of Droaamite species into all communities. Though goblins may make up the majority of a village's population, there could be a harpy songbird in the inn, a tiefling magewright teaching a class of kobold sorcerers, and the old ogre chib may have been replaced by a wise medusa. So, at first glance, a Droaamite village in the Barrens might seem primitive... but look closer, and you'll see a well-fed population, working together to improve the conditions of the community. But again, this system is new and the idea of Droaam is still finding its footing along the border. The old chib system still lingers, especially in the villages around Turakbar's Fist; Rhesh Turakbar and his reavers still enforce order with force and fear.",
										"When dealing with a Droaamite community\u2014or envisioning the background of an adventurer from Droaam\u2014keep these things in mind. Droaam has only existed in its current form for a decade, and any villages along the Border Road will be younger than that. Because of this, a village will have been built for a reason\u2014taking advantage of water, a manifest zone, mineral deposits identified by House Tharashk, or something else that makes the spot worth building on. And more so than in the typical Brelish village, Droaamties often have a sense of hope; they are working together, and their nation is on the rise. The exception to this is in the vicinity of Turakbar's Fist. Here the villages are older, as Turakbar's Fist has dominated the region since before the rise of Galifar. And many of those villages are ruled by tyrannical chibs and weighed down by despair.",
										"Droaam has a few institutions that play a vital role in the nation, and whose agents can be encountered on the frontier.",
										"{@b {@i Katra's Voice}} is the diplomatic arm of Droaam, and Voices are envoys, entertainers, diplomats, and mediators. Their task is to maintain morale and lines of communication, and to help resolve disputes before they get out of hand. Agents of Katra's Voice are usually changelings, medusas, tieflings, or harpies. Many highlight their role as entertainers, sharing stories with the common folk and painting tales of the bright future that lies ahead. Others focus more on mediation, especially if there is unrest between the local chib and the inhabitants of the community. Katra's Voice also includes wandering magistrates, who typically travel with two soldiers of Maenya's Fist. The current fashion is for medusas to serve as magistrates; if they consider a plaintiff's complaint to be frivolous, they petrify them. However, there are a few changeling magistrates with exceptional telepathic abilities who excel at unraveling difficult situations.",
										"{@b {@i Maenya's Fist}} is the personal army of Sora Maenya, which acts to defend the nation and to enforce the rule of the Daughters when Katra's Voice fails to resolve an issue. The foundation of the Fist is a corps of armored war trolls and skullcrusher ogres that are fanatically devoted to Sora Maenya; a single war troll can scatter a band of insubordinate ogres. However, over the last decade, the Fist has expanded to include a broader range of forces, including centaur cavalry, air support from gargoyles and harpies, rangers and scouts drawn from the Dark Pack, and more. As a general rule, warlords are expected to use their own forces to maintain order in their domains; near Turakbar's Fist adventurers are more likely to encounter a band of minotaurs than a squad of Maenya's Fist. Fists are either dispatched directly by Sora Maenya to deal with known threats, or found in the company of a Voice or an Eye whose mission they are supporting. Consider them Droaam's answer to the Westwind Riders\u2014or in the case of a large company of Maenya's Fist, the equivalent of Breland bringing Argonth into play.",
										"{@b {@i Teraza's Eye}} gathers information for the Daughters, and its members serve as sages, inquisitives, and chroniclers. Droaam is a new nation, and the Daughters need to know if their experiment is working. Often, Eyes simply travel and observe, gathering information without interfering; if they uncover dangerous situations, they will call on the Voice or the Fist. However, they can be tasked to investigate intriguing mysteries\u2014typically supernatural threats, as diplomatic or judicial matters will be handled by Katra's Eyes.",
										"{@b {@i The Znir Pact}} is another force adventurers on the Western Frontier will come to know. These gnolls are mercenary soldiers. Half of the Pact has been hired by the Daughters to serve as general peacekeepers, supplementing the forces of the local warlord and dealing with troubles that don't require the full power of Maenya's Fist. Znir gnolls can also be found serving a local warlord. So Znir patrols can be found on the Border Road or on the old roads, but they will generally ignore adventurers unless there is a threat that needs to be dealt with.",
										"So, new villages are springing up along the Border Road. Graywall is expanding. The lightning rail is heading west. And a squad of Maenya's war trolls showing up should be legitimately frightening. {@i Droaam is on the rise.}",

												"One of the most distinctive elements of an adventure on the Western Frontier is the presence of Droaamite species traditionally thought of as monsters, whether as adventurers or as NPCs. Due to the efforts of House Tharashk, Droaamites are starting to appear in cities across the Five Nations. But on the Western Frontier, they are a part of everyday life. Travel on the Border Road, and you'll run into Znir patrols and wandering worgs. Stop in a village west of the road, and you'll find a harpy singing in the tavern, delighting a crowd of goblins and kobolds. Communities east of the road usually have a Brelish majority, but you may still find an ogre unloading crates from the Thunder Coach, a gargoyle watching from a roof, or a family of goblins starting a new life. This section provides a closer look at the species that are presented as character options in chapter 4, along with an overview of many other denizens of Droaam. Whether creating characters for a Western Frontier campaign or choosing NPCs for a scene, keep these ideas in mind.",

The wind carried her whispers through the stone, and the gargoyles perched on the walls and crouching in the corridors of the keep turned on the templars.",

And a few follow their own paths, driven by curiosity or by the bonds they've formed with places or people.

																"Evidence suggests that Dhakaani stoneworkers in the region became obsessed with these \"guardian statues\" in the decades leading up to the first open conflict with daelkyr forces... and it was during that battle that the daelkyr Orlassk breathed life into the countless guardians. Orlassk never controlled the gargoyles directly, but they came into existence with an instinctive revulsion for organic life, a reaction much like most humans have when encountering mold or viruses. Creatures of flesh are fundamentally repulsive, rotting monstrosities filled with disgusting fluids and leaking foul excrement. The first gargoyles lashed out against the dar surrounding them, and claimed the fortresses they had once guarded as their own. But they soon realized that they were vastly outnumbered by the creatures of flesh. Beyond this, they didn't need anything from the world beyond their walls. They didn't need food or other supplies. So they remained at their posts, and eventually fell into a deep torpor. In this state, their spark of life was so weak that they couldn't even be sensed by {@spell Detect Good and Evil|XPHB}, which is how the templars of Brightstone Keep failed to recognize them for what they were. But they were still aware of their surroundings on a deep level. When Katra spoke to the gargoyles of Brightstone, each heard something different, the perfect story to pull them from their slumber. Some heard tales of the wonders waiting to be seen out in the world. For others, she painted pictures of the excitement to be found in battle, or the satisfaction to be found in protecting someone one cares about. Her magic roused them, but not all the stone host joined the hag. A small force of gargoyles had heard the songs and teachings of the Silver Flame even while they slept, and found the vision of the Flame to be compelling. These gargoyles helped a group of friars escape and return to Flamekeep, where they have embraced the Silver Flame and fight alongside the templars to this day; these gargoyles are now known as the {@i wingwyrds}.",
																"Brightstone Keep wasn't the only place where Sora Katra woke slumbering gargoyles. There were a handful of other shunned keeps along the edge of the Byeshk Mountains, and Katra roused the gargoyles in each. And there was one place where some gargoyles were already awake: Cazhaak Draal, the city at the heart of the Stonelands. When the medusas laid claim to the city, their queen spoke to the slumbering gargoyles. Some chose to remain in their torpor, but a handful awoke and were eventually convinced to work with the medusas. It was through this alliance that the gargoyles learned how to reproduce, as described later in this article. Medusa and gargoyle alike chose to remain isolated from the warlike denizens of the Barrens, and the gargoyles of Cazhaak Draal rarely left the fortress city. But the Cazhaak gargoyles have been awake for over a century; they are more used to the world and to working side by side with organic creatures, and some have adopted the Cazhaak faith. When the Daughters of Sora Kell established a new province centered on the newly-christened Grimstone Keep and appointed Cairngorm to serve as warlord and guardian of the province, many of the gargoyles of Cazhaak Draal flocked to their new prince.",
																"In creating a gargoyle, consider which of these categories you fall into. Did you slumber in the ruins for thousands of years? Did you live alongside the medusas of Cazhaak Draal? Are you a newborn, hewn in the gravel pits of Cazhaak Draal and still crafting your final form? Or are you a gargoyle with no connections to Droaam whatsoever... a statue infused with life elsewhere in the world?"

																"Gargoyles are elemental creatures, and their physiology defies all natural laws. When a gargoyle stands still, it is indistinguishable from a stone statue. They are made of light, inanimate stone... And yet, when they choose to move, they can. This same illogic applies to their wings. Gargoyle wings can take many forms, but the vast majority couldn't possibly keep a gargoyle aloft, and yet somehow they fly. Some scholars believe the gargoyles fly through an instinctive manipulation of elemental air, but nothing has been proven. With that said, the fact that gargoyles have the elemental type doesn't mean that they have any planar connection or any bond to other elemental creatures. They are elementals because they are creatures of animate stone.",
																"The majority of gargoyles follow the model of the Dhakaani guardian statue\u2014the classic horned, bat-winged humanoid. However, this is only due to the fact that these statues were produced in mass quantities. Firstly, the Dhakaani gargoyles weren't stamped out of a mold. The horned, winged design is common, but some gargoyles have ram's horns, tribex horns, or no horns at all. Likewise, gargoyle wings can be long or ridiculously small, stone carved in the likeness of leather or feathers. Someone exceptionally versed in the history of Dhakaan could potentially identify the ruin a sleeper gargoyle comes from based on its artistic design. And yet, when Orlassk animated the statues of the Barrens, it affected more than just the guardians. There are wingless gargoyles carved in the shape of ancient Dhakaani heroes. The Dhakaani were especially infuriated by this mockery of their champions and made an extra effort to destroy these creatures, but there are still a few scattered among the host of Grimstone. In creating a gargoyle character, consider how your appearance reflects your choice of class. Unlike warforged, gargoyles weren't built for a specific purpose; the Dhakaani artisans had no idea their creations would come to life. But the material used or design of a gargoyle could influence its capability. A gargoyle Druid could be carved from densewood instead of stone, while a gargoyle Sorcerer could have dragonshards or slivers of demonglass incorporated into its stone body.",
																"This highlights the fact that not all gargoyles have wings. The classic Dhakaani guardian\u2014represented by the gargoyle stat block in the Monster Manual\u2014has wings and claws, and is formed from dense stone. But a gargoyle with the shape of a bugbear hero or a Cazhaak newborn may be made from softer stone and lack both claws and wings. These traits are reflected by the feats Wings of Stone and Hewn for Battle (see chapter 4). If your gargoyle character begins at a high level, you may start with these traits. If you're playing a 1st level gargoyle character, you have yet to assume your final form, or perhaps you've simply chosen not to add wings to your design.",
																"This choice is reflected in the way gargoyles reproduce and grow. Gargoyles have no functional reproductive organs. To reproduce, two or more gargoyles work together to carve an egg. During this ritual, they infuse the egg with a fraction of their own lifeforce. The egg is buried in a pit of gravel or stone shards. Over time, it absorbs the surrounding chunks of rock, instinctively assimilating these and reshaping them to build its own body. The appearance of a newborn gargoyle usually reflects a blending of its parents, but this is a foundation. Gargoyles don't need to eat, but a growing gargoyle will consume chunks of stone that will be added to its mass. As it continues to grow, its appearance will shift to match its own evolving self-image."

																		"{@b Guardians} are driven by love of a person, place, or thing; their lives revolve around defending their wards. Guardians are typically stationary; these are the traditional gargoyles found on fortress walls, remaining perfectly still until something threatens their charge. However, a guardian could form an attachment to another character or even to an idea, like the wingwyrds of the Silver Flame. When playing a guardian gargoyle, consider: what drove your choice of ward? Could anything break this devotion?",
																		"{@b Thinkers} are rarely encountered, because even more than guardians, they often have no reason to move. A thinker enjoys contemplating weighty concepts. This could be religion, philosophy, arcane science, or any other topic. As a gargoyle thinker, you are likely adventuring to gain access to new sources of information related to the topic that interests you. But whenever there is no need to move, you may fall into a still reverie; during downtime, you could spend days without moving, as you consider the information you've gained."

																"Most gargoyles have little interest in clothing or material possessions. There's very little that they need. However, one of the greatest challenges for a gargoyle is boredom. Rather than gold, gargoyles often want to be paid in stories, songs, or jokes; they then use these as social currency in dealings with other gargoyles. Most gargoyles are tone-deaf and struggle to master musical pursuits, but the rare gargoyle bards and entertainers are held in high regard."

														"The first gnolls were born in the Age of Demons, a product of the endless war between Rak Tulkhesh and the Wild Heart. Even after the overlords were bound, their fiendish influence drove gnolls to engage in vicious acts of brutality. For countless generations, gnolls fought trolls, ogres, other gnolls, and any other creatures they could find, seeking blood for their hungry idols. But in time, leaders arose who urged their clans to resist the call of endless war. They dragged their idols to the place now known as Znir (\"Stone\") and shattered them. Though they might be many clans, from this day forward, they would be one pack. They would allow no one\u2014not chib, god, or demon\u2014to hold dominion over them. This was easier said than done. Fighting the fiendish influence within was challenging enough, but the Barrens were a chaotic tapestry of battling forces. The leaders of the newly forged Znir Pact had no desire to rule over other creatures, but even holding territory could invite attack. And so they developed the path that has carried them forward to this day: the road of the mercenary. The gnolls would claim no territory beyond the lands around Znir. They would fight for any who would pay a fair price. But if anyone sought to enslave a gnoll, or to strike against Znir itself, they would face the wrath of all the united clans. This was a lesson that had to be taught many times, but after a century or so, the point was made. To those who paid them, the gnolls were as reliable as stone. Those who betrayed them or who picked a fight would fall before the might of the full Pact. They have followed this path ever since. One could look at the Pact and say that they serve many masters.

																"The Znir gnolls include a dozen different clans, each of which holds distinct traditions. Once, the clans were devoted to different faces of the overlords, but when they shattered their statues, each clan chose one of the moons. All gnolls skillfully hunt and fight, but the Barrakas are known to be the finest trackers of the Pact; the Aryth, the deadliest archers; the Olarune, the strongest warriors and most forceful in the vanguard. Typically, mercenary units are composed of gnolls of a single clan, assigned based on the nature of the task that lies ahead, and contracts are usually negotiated for a period based on the cycles of the clan's moon. The clans maintain distinct territories within the Znir region, but all gnolls are welcome around the hearth of any clan; the Znir take pains to crush any tension that arises between the clans. Shamans and leaders from each clan maintain a council at the Znir, around the broken idols. Here they mediate disputes, assign contracts to clans, and allocate funds and equipment. The Eyre clan has honed their skills as smiths and tanners, and they craft much of the equipment used by the Znir gnolls\u2014though there is still a strong tradition of scavenging among the Znir, and warriors often claim trophies from fallen foes.",
																"The Znir defied the overlords when they shattered their statues, but there's still a spark of a fiend in the blood of each gnoll. Young gnolls learn how to resist this influence\u2014to channel the strength of the fiend without giving it power over them. For most gnolls, this is a matter of discipline; Znir gnolls are known for remaining calm in the face of provocation, and having learned to fight their own demons, they aren't easily manipulated by mortals. However, some gnolls learn to draw on their unnatural heritage and to channel this power in useful ways. Znir gnolls have their own equivalents of rangers and barbarians; the ranger's primal magic draws on the Wild Heart, while the barbarian channels the fury of the Rage of War. Znir shamans are similar to warlocks, typically following the path of the Fiend. However, in all of these examples, the Znir don't serve the dark power. Rather, they can be seen as stealing their strength from it; learning to draw on it without giving anything in return. In their determination not to let fiendish forces hold dominion over their people, the Znir gnolls have also developed their own techniques for fighting supernatural threats. Champions trained to face fiends and undead are known as hwyri\u2014Gnoll for \"warden\"\u2014and wield powers similar to those of paladins in other lands. However, hwyri don't worship any divine power. Their abilities come from training and understanding of the demon within; they aren't crusaders, they're mercenary demon hunters. Most hwyri come from the Vult clan, and in a land that shuns the Silver Flame, these gnolls can be the best hope for people facing fiendish threats."

In addition to those who serve through House Tharashk or Daask, a number of Znir have been sent east to study the Five Nations, gathering knowledge of its people and customs so the Znir council can determine how to engage with the wider world.

When stealth isn't necessary, the Znir are often quite vocal in battle; they generally coordinate actions and confirm positions with short bursts in Gnoll. Each Znir gnoll has a whoop, a unique call it uses as a sort of verbal signature; while these are extremely short, they convey both personal identity and clan loyalty. These are used to coordinate in the field, and it's common for a gnoll to whoop when entering a friendly location, as a simple way of identifying itself and giving allies an opportunity to respond. Beyond this, body language and posture\u2014usually slumped\u2014are an important part of gnoll communication; for example, when a gnoll feels threatened or angry, its thick crest of fur down the spine rises.

A harpy's voice is an outlet for all the passion they feel, and singing is a joyous release. The same is true of motion; for a harpy, soaring through the air isn't just a way to get from one point to another, it is a dance with the currents and the wind. Throughout most of the history of Galifar, harpies remained on their mountain peaks. Now they have descended to work with Droaam and Tharashk, and the harpy's song plays a vital role in holding the new nation together.",

The sage Dorius Alyre ir'Korran wrote {@i \"Taking glee in suffering and death, the sadistic harpy is always on the hunt for prey. Its sweet song has lured countless adventurers to their deaths, drawing them in close for the harpy to kill and then consume.\"} They were said to be children of the Fury and the Shadow set on Eberron to torment innocents and drive people to madness; the name harpy was a pejorative term. Scholars can point to historical examples of explorers drawn into chasms and other hazards. However, in many of these cases, the luring harpy wasn't even aware of the adventurers doomed by her voice. She sought only to sing, to express her joy or her sorrow\u2014and those who heard her wanted nothing more than to hear her better, ignoring all dangers as they pursued the haunting song. Most harpies take no glee in suffering or death, but they cannot help the impact their voices have on the people around them. This is why the harpies have long dwelt in the highest mountains\u2014to avoid harming innocents, to live in a space where they can dance with the wind and sing with full throat.",
																"Harpies have dwelt in the Byeshk Mountains for countless generations. They carve roosts into cliff faces with the power of their songs, and have felt no need to build cities or raise monuments; in their isolation, they don't need walls to defend themselves from enemies. Culturally, the Byeshk harpies are split into flights, and within flights they are further split into communities known as choirs. Flights are defined by traditions and by their songs; much like the Phiarlan elves, certain songs are treasures of a flight, heirlooms passed down to a single chosen singer.",
																"A decade ago, Sora Katra came to the high peaks and spoke to the elder voices of each flight. She painted a picture of a nation united, of the scattered creatures of the Barrens singing one song, and she asked the elders to descend and make this vision real. Harpies are passionate, and the leaders of the flights were passionate in their views. Four flights\u2014the Carrion Callers, the Last Dirge, the Rotwings, and the Stormsingers\u2014embraced Katra's vision, choosing to leave their mountain homes behind and lead their entire flights behind. Others refused. Some had no desire to leave their high mountains. Others doubted Katra's ability to achieve her dreams or questioned her motives. Callain of the Bloody Word said that the people of the world weren't meant to sing with one voice. The harpies of the Haunting Song took this further, swearing to use their voices to break Katra's vision. This led to the Carrion Callers and Stormsingers joining their voices together to break the Haunting Song. Katra chose to leave the other six dissenting flights in peace. They do not harm Droaam in their high peaks, but they take little part in it. While down below, the harpies of the four flights that are bound to the Daughters have spread across the realm. Harpy song is the mortar that binds the nation together. Songbirds rouse people's spirits at the start of a work day, and soothe them when work is done. Harpies inspire and delight; they can give hope to those who doubt, and end conflicts with a peaceful word. And when it comes to war, they can use their voices as weapons. Most harpies take no glee in suffering and death\u2014but in the first attack on Orcbone, harpy songs had defenders flinging themselves off the walls of the fortress to reach the source of the song. And the harpies serving with Daask have learned that a lure can be a devastating weapon in a city formed from bridges and towers..."

Whether singing goblins to sleep in a grist mill or carrying messages in Sharn, harpies embrace life with absolute zeal. But they hate just as strongly as they love. And little is more terrifying than a harpy roused to anger.",

They don't care what others believe, and will use the name of the Fury when speaking Common as it's the name others know. Each flight has its own story of the Song. The Stormsingers say that the Fury and the Devourer are one and the same, that the Song shapes the storm even as she drives the currents of the heart. The Last Dirge believes that the Song began at the first moment of creation, and that when it reaches its end the world will fade away. Regardless of belief, harpies feel the power of the Song flowing through them when they sing. However, it is power that must be mastered. The legendary lure isn't something all harpies can do; it is an art, and among the harpies those who can perform this are called sirens. But all harpies have power. The most basic gift that all harpies possess is the power to cast {@spell Friends}\u2014shifting emotions with a word. All harpies have access to a particular set of effects\u2014{@spell Charm Person|XPHB|Charm}, {@spell Suggestion|XPHB}. But beyond the abilities granted by the Harpy species, many class abilities can be linked to voice. It's easy to see how a harpy Bard can tie her magic to her song, but a harpy Cleric will sing her prayers; a harpy Druid channels the power of nature with his voice; and a harpy Warlock could depict her {@spell Eldritch Blast|XPHB} as sharp words that strike with physical force. Rangers are common among the Byeshk harpies. Archery is a useful art for flying hunters, and Ranger magic can likewise be tied to song; the {@spell Hunter's Mark|XPHB} of a Byeshk Ranger is sung as a curse."

From a distance, they can be mistaken for humans. Up close, the differences become clear. Medusas blend aspects of mammal and reptile; some medusa bloodlines have scaled skin, while others appear to be carved from stone. Culturally, Cazhaak medusas tend to present themselves as calm and confident, cool as stone. This reflects both the weight of their power and the confidence it gives them; to a medusa, all other creatures are fragile, and a medusa must take care not to break them. Beyond this, the Cazhaak faith is strong among the medusas and there is a serenity that comes from being one of the Shadow's chosen people. Many Cazhaak medusas are asexual; they value companionship and love, but aren't strongly influenced by sexual desire. However, not all medusas share these characteristics! There are medusas who embrace the passions of the Fury, and those who feel no devotion to the Cazhaak Six and follow different paths. Cazhaak medusas can live up to 250 years; they rarely show the effects of aging until the very end, and even then it's common for respected elders to be petrified and preserved in Cazhaak Draal.

The Shadow recognized their potential and ambition and gave them the power to break their chains; after an exodus that led them through many strange demiplanes, they finally reached the shelter of Cazhaak Draal. While the medusas thank the Shadow for their gifts, other scholars feel that this story shows that the medusas were created by the daelkyr Orlassk, and rebelled against their creator. Whether their gifts flow from the Shadow or from the daelkyr, medusas have an affinity for stone and for other creatures that possess the power of petrification. This isn't a primal bond like that of a druid or a Lorghalan gnome; it's in many ways a deeply unnatural connection, a reflection of the fact that, for a medusa, the line between flesh and stone is flexible. Most medusas say that they can hear stone whispering in its sleep; others say that it sings to them. Medusas who have an especially strong affinity for the stone can master a number of supernatural powers, from being able to mold and shape stone to locating veins of minerals and ore by listening to the songs.",

During the Sundering of Sarlona, these lords fled to Khorvaire and established a refuge, shielded from mundane and mystical sight. The tiefling lords and their human subjects remained in this shielded sanctuary for over a thousand years, building a city-state of arcane wonders. But the shields that protected the Venom Lords prevented them from leaving the demesne, and they had to take extreme measures to control their numbers and to power their many wonders. Ohr Kaluun was a harsh land, and the power of the tiefling lords came from old pacts with malefic forces; they were more than willing to walk the road of painful sacrifice to achieve their goals.",
														"It was Sora Teraza who first came to the Venomous Demesne. Her blind eyes were not fooled by illusions, and she walked through the wards as if they didn't exist. She spoke with the Venom Lords and told them of their futures. None know just what she said, but the next day the artificers of the Maze of Making were ordered to craft a gate that would allow passage to the world beyond the wards. Today, humans and tieflings of the Venomous Demesne can be found across Droaam. Human magewrights are helping to develop the arcane infrastructure of the new nation, while the noble tieflings bring greater powers to bear. Some tieflings see the world beyond the wards as a miserable backwater, hopelessly primitive. But others take real pleasure in helping to build something new, in exploring lands unbounded by wards, in walking beneath the sun and finding new paths to power that don't carry the burdens of the Demesne.",

Instead, they can use any of the Fiendish Legacies presented in the Player's Handbook\u2014Abyssal, Chthonic, or Infernal. These are hereditary traits reflecting the experiments and pacts of their ancestors; the noble families of the Demesne are tied to specific legacies.",

																"The civilization of the Venomous Demesne possesses a level of arcane science beyond that of the Five Nations. Overall, spell effects of up to 5th level can be seen at work in daily life and effects of up to 7th level can be encountered; the Maze of Making can reliably produce Rare, Very Rare, and even Legendary items. Teleportation and extradimensional spaces are incorporated into transit and housing. Casual illusions are used for entertainment and practical purposes. While the Maze of Mysteries is familiar with necromancy, the use of undead is quite rare in the Demesne... not because of any squeamishness, but simply because the traditions of the Demesne have other uses for the resources involved. Because all magic comes with a price. In the wider world, Eberron dragonshards are used to fuel arcane industry. But the Venomous Demesne was cut off from the outside world for over a thousand years; they had to find other sources of energy. The lords of Ohr Kaluun had long dealt with malefic powers and beyond that, the Demesne needed to limit its population. This led to the development of techniques that draw on the living for power. Two common currencies of the Demesne are {@b pain} and {@b time}\u2014each of which is transmitted through the medium of blood, drawn out in drops or carried in vials. Pain involves the immediate experience of pain, and is measured in loss of Hit Points. Time draws on the life force of the subject, providing a far greater yield than temporary pain, but resulting in a permanent reduction of an individual's maximum Hit Points. There are many other forms of currency, depending on the needs of the project and what the subject has to offer. Heartfelt tears have power. True and dangerous secrets can be useful. But the greatest power is the soul itself. There is a vast engine beneath the Maze of Promises that catches the souls of all who die within the wards of the Demesne. Souls with value may be set aside and given to the Maze of Faith for the possibility of resurrection. The rest are drawn into the great engine and distilled into crystal shards, which are capable of fueling magic just like an Eberron dragonshard.",

It is a world of wonders, in which the gods themselves are seen as tools to be used. But it is a harsh life, and there are many scions of the Demesne who take some joy in leaving their home behind.",
																"On a practical level, the cost of magic is something that only affects player characters in a cosmetic fashion. There is no cost to casting a cantrip, unless the adventurer wants to say that they jab their palm with a needle to trigger a jolt of pain. The soul- shards of the Demesne function just like Eberron dragonshards; they can be used in place of other costly components. So a Demesne eremite can use a soul- shard to cast Divination instead of burning incense... but a Demesne Wizard doesn't need to burn a fragment of a soul to cast {@spell Magic Missile|XPHB}. Like dragonshards in the wider world, it is the fuel of industry more than it is used by the typical adventurer. However, this is a key element in the fact that, as powerful and wondrous as the Demesne is, it lacks House Cannith's capabilities for mass production. The Maze of Making can produce Legendary magic items\u2014but it can't produce them quickly or in vast quantities."

They are a unique canid species, distinct from wolves and dogs. The Dhakaani worked closely with worgs, and because of this, small populations of worgs can be found across Khorvaire in places where the Dhakaani had strongholds.

This is the birthplace of the worgs. Despite its traits, it is not tied to Lamannia. It doesn't look outwards; the Wood watches what lies within. There is a vast pit in the center of the Watching Wood, surrounded by rotting vegetation and sludgy soil. The Worgs call this Nuushka, the Wound. They say it is a wound inflicted on the First Mother at the dawn of creation\u2014an injury inflicted on Eberron by Khyber's claws. The hypernatural traits of the Watching Wood are a response to the Wound. The fiends and foul things that emerge from the Wound are torn apart by the denizens of the Wood, never reaching the world beyond. Because of this, the Watching Wood is home to a vast array of monstrosities and beasts, both dire and horrid. It's worth noting that these monstrosities may seem monstrous to humans\u2014but they are children of Eberron, distinct from aberrations. And it is the hypernatural power of Eberron that resisted both the corruption of Avassh and the force that shaped the Barrens.",

The Marrowbound turn the power of the Wound against its spawn, pursuing a warlock path. But these packs dwell in the deep woods, and most have never seen or been seen by humanoids. It is the worgs of the outermost woods that interact with outsiders. In the past, they have been known as the Calador, loosely translated as the Uncaged or the Restless. It is the Calador who left the wood to work with the Dhakaani. But a century ago, the elf werewolf Zaeurl came to the Watching Wood, leading an exodus of lycanthropes from Aundair and the Eldeen Reaches. Zaeurl forged an alliance between her refugees, the Calador worgs, and other sentient predators of the outer woods. Together they became the Ghaal'kechan\u2014the Great Pack. Where the Calador had previously kept to the woods and kept others out of it, under Zaeurl's leadership they began to interact with the humanoids on the edge of their domain, forming ties with the gnolls of the Znir Pact and the changelings of Lost.

Academics debate whether the Sehn'te were created by the Dhakaani or whether they were the work of one of the daelkyr; the centaurs themselves have no written records and their oldest tales speak only of the chaos after the empire's collapse. The Sehn'te are nomadic hunter-gatherers; throughout the history of the Barrens they clashed with minotaur clans and the Gaa'aram orcs, but they largely chose to evade such threats rather than stand and fight. Since the rise of Droaam, the Daughters have convinced some of the Sehn'te to serve as scouts and couriers, and Maenya's Fist has an elite unit of Sehn'te cavalry that has had some legendary clashes with the Westwind Riders. Some Sehn'te have settled with the blended villages along the road, and adventurers could potentially encounter a centaur sheriff in a goblin village!",

The Twilight Harras are an alliance of centaurs that dwell around the Twilight Demesne in the Towering Wood. Twilight centaurs are fey creatures and take a wide variety of forms, combining elf and stag, dwarf and dog, horse and human, and many more\u2014though all have the same mechanical abilities regardless of their cosmetic appearance. Twilight centaurs have no permanent presence in the region, but can be found serving as Eldeen merchants or couriers, or accompanying other Eldeen travelers.",
																"As adventurers, a fey centaur from the Twilight Harras could be a Druid or Ranger with ties to one of the Eldeen druidic sects.

To the west, the changelings of Droaam come from the nomadic city of Lost, a hidden community that is both disguised and in constant motion. Those changelings that leave Lost are often part of Katra's Voice, moving among the people of Droaam as mediators or entertainers; in this role, they usually walk openly as changelings, often using their shape-shifting abilities aesthetically to add colors and patterns to their skin. Others gather information as part of Teraza's Eye, and these changelings typically use their gifts to blend in and move unnoticed.",

Skindancing is an artistic tradition developed in Lost, which blends motion and transformation; a Changeling Bard of the College of Dance could be a master of this art. The denizens of Lost also hone their innate telepathic powers, and this would be a logical path for a Soulknife Rogue or Great Old One Warlock; in the case of the Warlock, their patron might be the telepathic gestalt of Lost itself."

They learned long ago to value their cunning over strength; the heroes of their tales are quick and clever. They are patient and enduring, and tolerate endless suffering while waiting for an opportunity to present itself.",

They could come from Graywall or the Great Crag, having seen the rise of Droaam but now looking out for their own interests.

Almost all the minotaur clans revere the Horned King, and believe that the greatest champions will join their king after death. However, each clan has their own private name for the Horned King, and their own beliefs about the conduct he expects from his followers. Regardless of his name, most interpretations follow the basic principles of Tol Kharash: warfare and conquest, using fear and force to crush all enemies. However, the Red Hooves worship He Who Walks Behind, who is much like the Mockery; they focus on the use of terror and in deceiving their enemies. The Blade Breakers worship One Horn, who rewards strength and courage\u2014much like Dol Dorn. The Dawn Harvest was a clan whose version of the Prince\u2014the Dawn Gorer\u2014encouraged followers to fight with honor and to defend the weak, two traits rarely seen in Droaam. The Dawn Harvest was destroyed by Maenya's Fist after refusing to accept Rhesh Turakbar as the warlord of their region; a few members of the clan survived and are now scattered across Droaam.",

However, this aggression prevented the minotaurs from becoming a major power in the region, due to the long, destructive feuds between the clans themselves. The clans were delighted by the decade of conflict with Breland, and minotaurs continue to be the most common reavers found crossing the Border Road in search of glory. Minotaurs are fierce and brave, but they generally lack patience and discipline. They are terrifying raiders, but most lack discipline and have no patience for careful tactics. Most of the minotaur clans are tied to the warlord Rhesh Turakbar, but some clans have integrated with Droaam as a whole, and minotaurs can be found serving with Maenya's Fist, the Flayer Guard, House Tharashk, and others.",
																"The archetypal minotaur is a Barbarian, eager for battle and to defeat enemies in the name of the Horned King. This devotion doesn't prevent a minotaur from being a heroic adventurer; the Horned King accepts all worthy kills, no matter the cause or motives of the minotaur. Fiend Warlocks are also common among the clans that dwell near Turakbar's Fist. However, a minotaur adventurer could have turned their back on the traditions of their people. A minotaur Paladin or Cleric could be one of the last surviving members of the Dawn Harvest, seeking vengeance on Rhesh Turakbar and his masters."

They're used to their strength and durability carrying them through life and don't generally have to think quickly; everything will work out in time. Ogres typically pursue simple pleasures: food, drink, and crushing small creatures that annoy them. The various warlords charm them with harpy song and fill them with grist, then set them to work lifting heavy things and smashing things that need to be smashed. They're often recruited into local brute squads and serve as basic shock troops in the armies of Droaam. But they aren't innately aggressive. As chibs in the Barrens, ogres would use their strength to gather what they needed to live a comfortable life, including tiny servants. But unlike the Gaa'aram or the minotaur clans, they would rarely raid others or seek conflict for pleasure; in many ways, they can be seen as mighty children. While physically powerful, they're easily swayed by strong personalities and compelling stories. They are very emotional\u2014though they can shift between emotions rapidly\u2014and love stories and songs, even if stories need to be kept simple. It's not uncommon for an ogre to develop a deep attachment to their favorite harpy or changeling storyteller. As long as they are happy, ogres can be kind and even gentle.",

The Gaa'aram embraced the chaotic, raiding lifestyle of the Barrens. Where the goblins and kobolds were often enslaved by more powerful creatures, the Gaa'aram voluntarily rallied around the most powerful leaders and served as fierce warriors. To an orc of the Gaa'aram, who you fight for is less important than the fact that you fight and fight well. As such, Gaa'aram orcs were often encountered as raiders; they're the reason for the name of the fortress that guards the gap between the Graywall Mountains and Silver Lake; Orcbone. Gaa'aram orcs can be found in all the diverse cities, and they're passionate supporters both of Droaam and their local warlords.",

They believe that violence stains the soul\u2014that those whose souls are pure when they die will pass beyond Dolurrh, but that killing another forever destroys a piece of your soul. The Gaa'ran held firm to their beliefs even in the face of torment and slavery, and over time it became common for the Barrens chibs to allow Gaa'ran settlements to stand\u2014with the understanding that the local raiders would regularly show up and take their produce. While this was a harsh life, the Gaa'ran have prospered under the Daughters of Sora Kell. Though grist is the primary source of sustenance in Droaam, the Daughters recognize the value of agriculture, and Gaa'ran tribes have been given resources and placed in charge of a number of agricultural projects.",
																"There is, of course, a third source of orcs one might meet on the frontier: House Tharashk. The House of the Mark of Finding has come to an understanding with the Daughters of Sora Kell. Tharashk prospectors are searching for dragonshards in the Barrens, Tharashk bounty hunters ply their trade across the frontier, and Tharashk recruiters urge Droaamite mercenaries to broker their services through the house. The house has its local seat in the Calabas district of Graywall, where viceroy Kundran Torrn oversees the enclave and the district. While Tharashk scions may be orcs, humans, or jhorgun'taal (half-orcs), orcs make up the majority of the house agents on the frontier.",

										"The heart of the Western Frontier is the vast stretch of plains that lies between the Korlaac Rift to the west and the Whitehorn Woods in the east. In the south, the Graywall Mountains serve as a simple dividing line between Droaam and Breland, but there's no clear natural boundary in the central plains. As a result, people have turned to an unnatural feature; the Orien trade road that runs between Ardev and Sylbaran. For centuries, this road has been a crucial channel for trade and supplies. During the Last War, Breland maintained forces at the Eldeen Ford, but the agreements with the Dragonmarked Houses kept Aundair from targeting the road. In the wake of the war, it has continued to serve as a crucial path for commerce between Breland, Aundair, and the Eldeen Reaches. As they are working to forge alliances with the dragonmarked houses, the Daughters of Sora Kell are reluctant to disrupt the trade road\u2014and Breland is determined to hold it, recently assigning Argonth to patrol the edge of the road. While Breland has yet to acknowledge Droaam's sovereignty, the common people recognize the trade road as the line between the two nations\u2014and this idea was strengthened when House Sivis used the road to define the boundary between Droaam and Breland. While its official name is Orien Route 7, if you've spent any time on the Western Frontier, you know it as the Border Road.",
										"The Border Road isn't a hard line. There are kobolds camping in the more fertile lands east of the road and Brelish settlers seizing opportunities to the west. If a patrol of Westwind Riders is chasing brigands on the Brelish side, they won't stop the instant the bandits cross the Border Road into Droaamish lands. However, the Border Road is a definite line of truce between the two nations. The Westwind Riders won't cross the road unless they have reason to\u2014and the Znir gnolls serving the Daughters of Sora Kell keep their patrols to the west of the road. If they're on the western side of the Border Road, the minotaurs of Turakbar's Fist are soldiers of Droaam defending their nation; if they're encountered to the east of the road, they're raiders seeking glory. Such raids often go both ways; the Brelish draw attention to these minotaur attacks, but prefer not to address the fact that the Black Crown brigands are just as brutal when they attack Droaamite settlements on the west side of the road. If you're Brelish, you can consider yourself generally safer if you stay to the east, and Droaamites feel more secure west of the Border Road\u2014but there's no absolute security anywhere on the Western Frontier, unless you're inside Argonth.",
										"As an adventurer, your travels will likely lead you off the beaten trail, but the Border Road is at the center of the Western Frontier, and the focus of commerce and travel. The plains around the road are sparsely populated and filled with dangers: wandering monstrosities, brigands, sinkholes, and other unexpected hazards. You can easily blaze your own trail across the plains, but if you do, there's a chance you could go a day or more without even seeing another humanoid, let alone an inn\u2014and if you're set upon by bandits, there's little chance the Westwind Riders will show up to save you. The Border Road is paved and maintained. Brelish forces patrol the road. There are Gold Dragon Inns waiting for you at Sylbaran, Unicorn Point, Quickstone, and Ardev. There are a host of hamlets and farmsteads along the road; like a river, this channel of trade and travel provides a strong foundation for new communities to build on. These benefits come with a dark side though; because the Border Road is the safest, best maintained route for commerce, it's also the prime target for brigands and highwaymen. Think of it like pirates on the sea, but instead of galleons there are Orien Thunder Coaches laden with goods.

This mixture is infused with a dash of finely ground Siberys dragonshards, which facilitates the magical effects employed by Orien heirs; this causes the road to glitter faintly in Bright Light, and harmless sparks sometimes rise under the hooves or wheels of Orien-enhanced vehicles and mounts. There are no guardrails or barriers along most of the length of the road, but in regions where the terrain is particularly hazardous to vehicles\u2014for example, a stretch in the north with swamplike terrain\u2014there are two-foot railings along the edge of the road.",

These are simple towers\u2014often just a platform atop a pillar\u2014where a handful of soldiers keep an eye out for trouble. The guards at these watchtowers aren't sufficient to battle bandits or raiders alone; but if they spot trouble, they can trigger an Alarm that alerts Orcbone, while sending up a flare to summon any nearby Brelish forces. Aside from this, there are villages, hamlets, and farmsteads all along the road. Most of these are small communities without dragonmarked services; they rely on the constant stream of traffic for news and services. However, villages usually have some form of pub or inn that travelers can take Advantage of, even if services are somewhat limited. The primary stopoff for travelers is Unicorn Point, an Orien outpost halfway between the Graywall Mountains and the Eldeen border."

Whatever the truth, what is known with certainty is that Mesa is both a stone giant and a master stoneworker.

There is a statue of the late Countess Thalia\u2014Thavius's mother, slain by the Daughters of Sora Kell\u2014in the town square, that evokes a sense both of Thalia's courage and the tragedy of her loss.

												"For generations, the fortress Orcbone and its Westwind Riders have been the primary defense of the Western Frontier. That changed in 998 YK, when King Boranel assigned Argonth to the region. Once the most imposing weapon in Breland's arsenal, Argonth is a floating fortress quartering over a thousand soldiers and enough arcane artillery to level a village. Its presence in the region shows that Boranel recognizes the growing power of Droaam and the potential for renewed conflict. Argonth guards the southern stretch of the border; Orcbone is too far north to be able to quickly respond to an attack against Quickstone or the Westroad, the recently upgraded road to Graywall. While its mobility is useful, Argonth only has a sustainable cruising speed of 2 miles per hour and it can easily be avoided by mounted brigands or smugglers. But while it may not be able to intercept a small force of minotaur reavers, it can hold the Westroad against thousands if it comes to war.",
												"There is a second reason Boranel has assigned Argonth to the frontier. Impressive as it is, Argonth is almost eighty years old and it is one of the last of the floating fortresses. Breland stopped building the fortresses in 970 YK; military strategy has shifted, and Breland is currently following other paths (developing swift, mobile forces; improving artillery; developing air forces). On the Aundairian border, Argonth is something of a relic. But on the frontier, Argonth serves as a check on the Droaamite forces stationed at Graywall and as a symbol of Breland's determination to hold the region.",

Over fourteen hundred crewmembers are combat-ready, with the remainder being dedicated solely to support and administration.

The Force Staffs draw power from the elemental engine and don't require Breath of Siberys, but the others must be loaded normally.

This arcane artillery, and the Breath of Siberys that powers it, are described in Exploring Eberron.",

Pilots don't have to have dragonmarks, but a side effect of this is that the binding and control process is more dangerous and demanding. Argonth requires a team of active pilots, and pushing the fortress to higher speeds takes a mental and physical toll on the pilots. At one point during the Last War, Argonth maintained a sustained speed of 10 miles per hour for two days to respond to an attack; three pilots died from overexertion.",

While Galifar was intact, the primary mission of Orcbone was patrolling Orien Route 7, dealing with any bandits who threatened the Border Road. For much of the Last War, this region had little strategic value and Orcbone was underfunded and understaffed. This changed with the rise of Droaam. In 986 YK, Countess Thalia ir'Blis was killed by Droaamite forces and Orcbone itself suffered grave damage. King Boranel reinforced the fortress and appointed Commander Veirner ir'Tajar. Orcbone has held the line for the last decade, resisting a siege in 989 YK and serving as an important base of operations for lesser conflicts along the Western Frontier. However, with the rise of Graywall and Quickstone, most areas of strategic importance are in the southern region of the frontier, far from Orcbone. While the fortress continues to hold the line against Rhesh Turakbar and the forces of Turakbar's Fist, Boranel has deployed the floating fortress Argonth to secure the southern region and to serve as a symbol of Brelish might. Commander ir'Tajar sees this as a stinging rebuke of his command, and he may be right to think this; he's made questionable decisions over the last few years, and the deeds of Breggan Blackcrown\u2014both when she served under ir'Tajar's command and now as a brigand\u2014are a stain on his record. Many wonder when\u2014not if\u2014the king will replace ir'Tajar, and it's common knowledge that the commander would love a new outbreak of hostilities to prove his mettle.",

The Brelish fortress played a vital role in driving back these reavers. According to the tales, the bones of the fallen orcs were scattered across the plains as a warning, hence the name. Some believe you can still find shards of ancient bone around the fortress, while others claim that this was a foolish act that has left the region haunted by the restless spirits of fallen orcs.",
												"The Western Frontier is wide and open. Orcbone is built to withstand a siege, and the forces of the Barrens have attacked it a surprising number of times; the reavers see it as a way to test their mettle. However, given that attackers can easily just circle around the fortress, Orcbone's primary mission is to serve as a base of operations for the Westwind Riders, a cavalry force that patrols the Border Road and quickly responds to threats. There are watchtowers scattered around the region, approximately 20 miles apart. Each tower can signal Orcbone using a form of Alarm. This doesn't allow any sort of detailed message; if the alarm sounds, it's a call for the Westwind Riders to respond.",

The fortress is made of stone, grim and functional in its design. It stands atop a slight hill that gives it a commanding view of the surrounding plains. Over the centuries, a series of wide ditches have been dug into the hill. To approach Orcbone, you must pass through these trenches while being fired upon by the archers in the keep; the classic Orcbone strategy is to have a force of Westwind Riders approach the attacking force from the rear, crushing them up against the walls of the keep. The keep itself shows its age; the walls are chipped and scorched. The Commander's requests for greater funds are generally met with the statement \"We sent you aid; we sent you Argonth.\"",

Both of these groups largely dwell in temporary shelters outside of town while they wait for more permanent residences to become available.

												"Affectionately known as \"Tribex Town,\" Shavalant lies at the center of a vast array of ranches in the business of raising plains tribex, riding tribex, and a wide range of other livestock; the Vadalis enclave known as the Farm breeds war beasts, including Breland's famed dire bears. While Shavalant has a smaller population than Ardev or the great cities of the east, it is a wide town; ranchers 20 miles away from the town center still consider themselves to be part of Shavalant. The Farm is House Vadalis's largest enclave in Breland, and almost everyone in the town works for the house in some capacity. This doesn't prevent the people of Shavalant from being proudly Brelish; most believe their work strengthens both the house and their nation, and they see House Vadalis as a positive in the world.",
												"Shavalant lies just north of Whitehorn Wood, and ranches run along the edge of the vast forest. The town flies a white flag that bears an image of a rampant bear with curling horns. This is Whitehorn, who the locals will tell you is a patron of both Shavalant and Breland. According to the stories, Whitehorn is a massive horned bear\u2014\"larger than the largest dragon\"\u2014who dwells deep in the Whitehorn Woods. When settlers first came to the region, they cut back the woods and angered Whitehorn, who emerged and crushed their farmsteads. Eventually, Hala d'Vadalis\u2014who the locals generally call \"Hala Whitehorn''\u2014established a clear set of edicts about how to deal with the Whitehorn Woods, limiting harvesting and hunting. According to the legends, since then, Whitehorn has dwelled in harmony with the townsfolk, and people even swear that if the town is truly threatened, Whitehorn will emerge from the woods and defend it.",
												"While it's a charming story, this is Breland, not the Eldeen Reaches; Shavalant is an industrial town. There's a powerful Lamannian manifest zone in the Whitehorn Woods, and House Vadalis is harnessing the power of that zone to enhance the production of livestock. Beasts born in the ranches adjacent to the zone are especially strong and fertile. Attempts to cut back the woods or overharvesting of its resources trigger catastrophic effects\u2014including attacks by swarms of birds, dire beasts, and possibly, a megafauna bear. Beyond this, any structures built beyond the \"forest line\" rapidly rot or corrode. The people of Shavalant have learned exactly where the line is and they push right up to the edge. They do harvest lumber and hunt on the edge of the Whitehorn, taking Advantage of how quickly things regrow; it's simply that Hala's edicts set clear boundaries on just what can be harvested from the woods and when. People may love their Whitehorn flag, but there's no druidic reverence here: This is a practical arrangement based on scientific principles.",

Every year someone lobbies for the hunt to take place in Whitehorn, but Viceroy Kyara doesn't want to disturb the powers sheltering within the woods.",
																"Shavalant was briefly occupied by Aundair during the Last War, but they underestimated the deadly capabilities of the war beasts Vadalis had at its disposal. While most of these are well known\u2014notably, the dire bears\u2014many say that the Farm has a host of scorpions and serpents bred to serve as primal assassins.",
																"A far more dangerous attack came in 993 YK, when a group of Ashbound druids from the Eldeen Reaches caused chaos by turning the beasts of Shavalant against the ranchers. The Ashbound were slain, but there was significant damage and death. Some believe that a wounded Ashbound druid escaped into Whitehorn and may yet return to wreak further destruction.",
																"Druids and anyone from the Eldeen Reaches receive a cold reception in Shavalant, and anyone openly declaring themselves to be Ashbound will face an angry mob. While this is linked to the Ashbound incident, it also ties to a larger idea that druidic beliefs are directly at odds with Shavalant's way of doing business... and if a Shavalant farmer wants to keep battery hens, you can shut up and eat your damn eggs."

The Gold Dragon Inn offers exactly the same services you'll find at the Gold Dragon Inn in Ardev or Graywall; it's reliable and certainly comfortable, but unremarkable. The Bull's Blood is a tavern catering to slaughterhouse workers and can be a rough place. The Milk Bar is a joint venture of a Ghallanda and Vadalis heir, offering the milk of a vast assortment of beasts and even a few monstrosities. If you can afford better\u2014or at least more local\u2014than the Gold Dragon Inn, the Brand is the oldest inn in Shavalant and is especially celebrated for its steaks and savory pies.",
														"There are dozens of ranches around Shavalant. The Triple Horn and the Arrowhead ranches breed riding tribex, while the Lazy Dragon and Gray Bull ranches breed plains tribex for meat, leather, and as beasts of burden. These are just a few that focus on tribex; if you live in Breland and own a tribex, the odds are good you can trace its lineage back to Shavalant. A more exotic ranch is the Royal Bear, which shifted focus (and name) during the Last War to focus on breeding and training dire bears. A similarly exotic ranch is the Bright Beak, which specializes in breeding hippogriffs.",
														"The most important location in Shavalant is the Farm, the casual name for a Vadalis enclave that includes a sprawling central keep and a few acres of pastures, stables, and training facilities. The Farm includes an administrative wing where Viceroy Kyara contemplates long-term strategies and evaluates reports from the many ranches Vadalis manages or licenses. Another wing is devoted to evaluating and working with new or exotic beasts and monstrosities; if Vadalis decides to try domesticating cockatrices, they'd start by bringing some to the Farm. The stables at the Farm are devoted to beasts that can't yet be handed off to a ranch. During the war, a few generations of dire bears were bred at the Farm before the work was transferred to the Royal Bear ranch. At the moment, they could be working on a better breed of tribex, a bloodhound with a sharper sense of smell, or songbirds that can mimic the voices of famous entertainers. The most secure branch of the Farm is the War Offices, where heirs work to evaluate and hone the martial abilities of their beasts. This includes developing more efficient means of training existing war beasts\u2014war tribex, war horses, war hounds\u2014as well as working to magebreed traits that could make such animals more effective on the battlefield. As suggested earlier, there are certainly rumors that the War Office has a division\u2014and perhaps, a secret subterranean facility\u2014devoted to beasts that can be used as tools of assassination.",
														"Thanks to the importance of House Vadalis's operations, Shavalant has a suite of dragonmarked services. The small Kundarak bank and Sivis message station (Stone 124) share a building. Orien has a station that runs a steady stream of caravans, including coaches designed to transport large beasts and preserving coaches that use a form of Gentle Repose to transport meat. The local Jorasco clinic is called Helping Hands. House Deneith has an office that focuses on providing security for ranchers in need, and Tharashk maintains an outpost that's mainly a waystation for private inquisitives and bounty hunters. Finally, in addition to the Farm and its many ranches, House Vadalis runs a facility formally called The College of Balinor's Gift but is more generally just called Farm School; this offers training in mundane and magical techniques of animal husbandry and veterinary medicine.",
														"Shavalant has a small temple devoted to the Sovereign Host, and most especially to Balinor\u2014the Sovereign who grants dominion over the animal kingdom. Services are conducted by Tolan Gray, a shifter who asserts that House Vadalis is blessed by Balinor. In return, Vadalis strongly supports the church... and it is likely no coincidence that Tolan Gray also serves as the magistrate of Shavalant."

Common practice is to refer to these fey patrons as their great-grandfathers or great-grandmothers, though some villages have other customs. Much like the people of Shavalant and the Whitehorn Wood, the Lakefolk don't romanticize these relationships or have any special love for the fey. It's a simple business arrangement they need to fulfill, and some Lakefolk resent these lingering agreements. On the other hand, breaking a pact can have disastrous consequences; there are a few ghost towns along the shore, abandoned because of the enmity between the villagers and the resident fey. Most of the Lakefolk aren't especially knowledgeable about the fey and don't have a way to reliably contact their patron. The wandering Greensinger known as Briar has often sought to serve as an intermediary between the Lakefolk and their patrons, but many of the Lakefolk don't want some outsider interfering with their business.

In this, it reflects the original alliance forged by the Wardens\u2014the farmers of western Aundair and the druidic initiates of the Towering Wood\u2014working together for the greater good. The notable holdout among the sects is the Ashbound; Sylbaran may be a relatively small town, but it is still too civilized and industrial for the Ashbound extremists.",
												"Warden initiates work with farmers, hunters, and fisherfolk throughout the Eldeen Reaches. Unlike the Ashbound, the Wardens don't oppose metalworking, arcane magic, or basic industry; their focus is on sustainability and minimizing damage to the environment. Gleaners use Plant Growth, Mold Earth, Druidcraft, and other rituals to enhance farming and construction. Beyond this, Sylbaran is a focal point for commerce with the southern nations. There are well developed docks to handle shipping on Silver Lake and warehouses filled with Eldeen produce waiting to be picked up by Orien caravans. Despite this, Sylbaran is unmistakably an Eldeen community. Much of Sylbaran's illumination is provided by bioluminescence. Swarms of bees support the Warden peacekeepers. The fisherfolk sing fish into their nets. While much of the town still uses the pre-Eldeen infrastructure, the newer buildings are made from shaped earth\u2014not unlike the quickstone structures of Quickstone, though not as durable. Many of these are on the edge of town, but there are a few in the center, replacing buildings that were destroyed during the Brelish occupation.",
												"Overall, the people of Sylbaran are happy folk who love their town and the natural world around it. Sylbarans know their neighbors and are always ready to lend a hand to other members of the community. They prefer harmony to strife and prefer to solve problems peacefully whenever possible. However, they're quite used to dealing with outsiders who don't share these ideals. While Sylbarans are patient with travelers, there are limits to this patience. Animal abuse (such as mistreating mounts) will not be tolerated, and someone seen pissing in the lake is likely to be thrown in it. The townsfolk stick together, and if someone sees a crime being committed, they will typically raise a hue and cry and get involved, rather than passing by. However, there are always new outsiders who don't know the ways of the Reaches, so there's always trouble to be found.",

Look from above, and you can see that this was surely the heart of the ancient city; a fortress tower, a spire of dark polished stone studded with blades and sharp edges. No mortal hand or mundane tool could shape such a thing. It is a vile relic of a forgotten age, the hand of an overlord raised in defiance. The Dhakaani named it t'Kaash, the Fist. They recognized it as a thing of evil, but even the power of the empire couldn't destroy t'Kaash.

Given the power of this place, some might wonder why the Daughters of Sora Kell didn't claim it themselves. Why isn't this the seat of power, instead of the Great Crag? The obvious answer is that this isn't the vision they have for Droaam. However great the power in this place, it is a place of petty tyranny. Turakbar and his Fist are a useful tool for the Daughters, certainly, but the warlord of t'Kaash will always be driven to dominate through force and terror.

												"For centuries, Orien Route 7 has been an important trade road allowing for the transport of goods between Breland and Aundair. Unicorn Point was established centuries ago as a simple Orien waystation to support couriers and caravans. Then they realized that they needed a Vadalis presence to provide fresh mounts for couriers and caravan teams. And what about a Gold Dragon Inn to support the increasing traffic? And a Jorasco healer to take care of injured travelers? And a Cannith tinker to repair damaged vehicles? With each such addition, Unicorn Point grew, until it had truly become a town in its own right. However, it's in a strange middle ground because it's not a traditional town. The residents of Unicorn Point aren't Brelish or Droaamite, they're all heirs of the dragonmarked houses. There is no mayor or magistrate; everyone in Unicorn Point works there, and the houses are renting the land from Count ir'Blis. House Orien has the strongest presence in Unicorn Point, but they don't hold any sort of absolute authority over the other house representatives. In general, it's in everyone's best interests to get along... but there's a lot of room for interhouse intrigue at Unicorn Point! Overall, Unicorn Point is dense, functional, and relentlessly commercial. Every service is tied to a house guild. All permanent residents live in house outposts. It's not a town; it's more like a spaceport or a truck stop.",

Initially assigned to assist the Deneith mercenaries at the Point, Kolara took charge when other house leaders were slain in a raid during the war. House leadership was impressed by her charisma and tactical acumen and assigned her the de facto command of the Point. Kolara is good at her job, maintaining strict discipline among the Orien staff and ensuring the steady flow of traffic; it helps that she has a keen understanding of the teamsters' experience. But she also delights in spending time in the Gold Dragon Inn and the Orien canteen, gambling and carousing with travelers and encouraging the drivers to share their tales. She is renowned for her capacity for drink and her luck at cards, and beloved by many travelers\u2014hence her title as the Queen of the Road. Now fifty-three, Kolara isn't as spry as she once was and prefers to avoid drawing her sword. However, her training as a Blade of Orien allows her to cast a variation of Vortex Warp, teleporting a target up to 150 feet to a place she can see or knows well; those who cause trouble in the Gold Dragon might suddenly find themselves in the brig."

While it is tiny in comparison to the Gold Dragon Inn, if you're keen to try Droaamite cuisine or to listen to a little harpy song, head to the common room at Veskala's. Veskala herself grew up in the kitchens of what is now Turakbar's Fist. She escaped to Graywall when the Daughters rose to power, and it was there she befriended Viceroy Torrn. She is devoted to the Fury and there may have been some divine power that has helped her survive and prosper. Veskala takes vengeance very seriously, and she is determined to someday make Rhesh Turakbar pay for the suffering he's inflicted on her and her kin; this may be something a party of adventurers could help with."
