						"Five Nations. Secrets of Sarlona. Most canonical Eberron sourcebooks focus on broad concepts or regions\u2014continents, nations, the Last War. Sharn: City of Towers focuses on the greatest city in Khorvaire. In the wake of Exploring Eberron, I knew I wanted to do something different\u2014to dive deeper into a smaller region, picking an interesting point on the map where a group of adventurers could make a difference, and where they could see a town prosper (or fail!) because of their actions. I wanted to explore stories on the edge of the map instead of at the heart of it. But knowing that I wanted to tell stories on a frontier, the question was which frontier? Because in 998 YK, there are a number of interesting choices. Aundair and the Eldeen Reaches. The shard rush in Q'barra. Darguun. All of these were solid options. But ultimately, I love the nation of Droaam. I love looking at creatures that are traditionally classified as monsters and imagining the nation they could build working together. And so this book explores the region that lies between the established human kingdom of Breland and the new, rising nation of Droaam. The opportunity drawing people here isn't gold or even dragonshards. It's Droaam itself, a young nation that is coming into its own. I knew I wanted to tell a tale that draws on classic western tropes, where you could play a warforged sheriff, a small-town preacher, a retired Sentinel Marshal with skeletons in his past. But I loved that this is a place where the Ranger could be a worg and where the Bard might be a harpy\u2014where the classic fantasy elements of Breland mingle with the monstrous denizens of Droaam.",
						"Quickstone began as an adventure\u2014a starting point for characters that wasn't Sharn or Stormreach. As we explored the story, I realized that I wanted to take it further, exploring the entire region and the stories we could tell there. As it turned out, the road to Quickstone was long and hard, filled with random encounters and unexpected challenges. I appreciate the hard work of everyone who's helped us reach the end of this journey. Wayne Chang kept the project moving forward, with help from Sumeet Vats in the final stretch. Imogen Gingell brought the adventure \"Heart of Stone\" to life, as well as developing subclasses, feats, monsters, and treasures. Luke Volker refined our writing and made sure we were in line with the revised rules in the 2024 version of the fifth edition Player's Handbook, while Sam Sorensen put all the pieces together. A host of artists contributed to the book, and I'm grateful to Carolina Cesario, Matthew Johnson, Julio Azevedo, GAOZ, Vincentius Matthew, Sylverryn, Jonathan Ng, Alexandra Coggon, Olie Bollador, and Eldon Cowgur for giving us a vision of the Western Frontier\u2014and especially to Thomas Bourdon for his amazing cover and to Marco Bernardini for his incredible map of Quickstone. Marco completed this map in 2021, and I'm so happy to finally share it with the world.",
						"But there's another group of people to thank. It's taken a long time to finish the book, but for the last few years I've been running a campaign set in Quickstone for my patrons. Hundreds of people have contributed time and energy toward shaping Quickstone, and many of the NPCs you'll find here are drawn from that campaign. So thanks to everyone who has been a part of Quickstone\u2014and to you for exploring it now. And thanks to my partner Jennifer Ellis for walking from Quickstone to Silver Lake with me.",
						"As always, this book is a vision of Eberron as I run it at my table. You may find details that don't align precisely with previous sourcebooks. It's up to you to decide which version to use\u2014or to use both as inspiration for your own ideas! From the beginning, we wanted Eberron to inspire people to create their own stories. So welcome to the Frontier\u2014I hope you'll make it your own!",

						"When people think about adventures in Eberron, they often think of distant and legendary locations\u2014the jungles of Xen'drik, the dragon-realms of Argonnessen, the hidden lands of Sarlona. Others look to the great cities of Sharn, Korth, or Fairhaven, metropolises teeming with people. But there is adventure to be had in the cracks between the great cities and distant lands. In the wake of the Last War, new nations have broken away from the yoke of Galifar, and this has created a host of unique frontiers and untapped opportunities. West of Breland, a number of different cultures have joined together as the nation of Droaam. The medusas of Cazhaak Draal have opened their stone gates, the tieflings of the Venomous Demesne have emerged from their hidden kingdom, and the infamous Daughters of Sora Kell stand above it all. Breland and the other Thronehold nations have refused to recognize Droaam\u2014and this, in turn, means that Droaam isn't obliged to respect the laws and traditions of the nations of the east. And it further means that the border between Droaam and Breland is largely a theoretical concept. This has left a wide swath of land where no one truly holds sway\u2014where each village must stand ready to defend itself from brigands and raiders, where Brelish and Droaamite may dwell side by side, where Cannith goods can be found alongside the arcane creations of the Venomous Demesne. It's a region filled with ancient ruins, some of which have been shunned for centuries\u2014often with good reason. And it is a region filled with expanding cities and newborn hamlets, where people have come in search of opportunity in spite of the danger. This is the Western Frontier.",
						"All the themes of Eberron\u2014the concepts discussed in Eberron: Rising from the Last War\u2014are in play on the frontier. There is opportunity for pulp adventure, for fighting demon-fueled champions in ancient Dhakaani ruins or racing to stop nefarious cultists from releasing the deadly daelkyr. And there's room for noir intrigue, for schemes driven by petty greed and human weakness. The impact of the Last War can be felt here, as veterans and refugees settle in unclaimed lands and war criminals and deserters from the east hide from justice. But there are other themes that are unique to this time and place. This is an opportunity to explore the shifting balance between Droaam and Breland, to find mysteries in towns too small to show up on any map, to bring justice to places where it's long been forgotten. So strap on your wand and saddle up the tribex\u2014Quickstone awaits.",

								"In the distant past, the lands west of Breland were a vibrant part of the goblin Empire of Dhakaan. The Six Kings monument on the northern edge of the Graywall Mountains commemorates the founding of this empire. At that time, the region was prosperous and fertile, and networks of roads and tunnels connected a host of Dhakaani towns and cities. That golden age was torn down by the daelkyr. The Xoriat Incursion wasn't a single focused invasion. It was a series of waves, each stronger and deadlier than the last. Orlaask, Avassh, and Dyrrn sank their tendrils into the region and spread corruption and chaos. Some of these were straightforward, physical conflicts\u2014hordes of dolgaunts and dolgrims supported by mind flayers and beholders clashing with disciplined Dhakaani legions. Others were more subtle, such as Avassh's creation of rageweed, a swiftly spreading plant whose pollen causes hallucinations and enhances aggression in bugbears and hobgoblins. It's not known with certainty who caused the environmental damage, but historical records show that the region now known as the Barrens was once verdant and fertile. It could be that it was the daelkyr Avassh who drained the life from the soil... or it may be that the Dhakaani themselves devastated the land in a desperate, pyrrhic effort to contain the threat posed by the daelkyr. Ultimately, the Daelkyr were defeated, but the damage was irreparable. The psychic wounds inflicted by the daelkyr festered, and civil war, chaotic upheavals, and lingering aberrations and monstrosities tore the empire apart. Within two centuries, the Barrens were a dusty region of haunted ruins. Bugbears and hobgoblins were nearly eradicated. Goblins remained, but they were soon subjugated by the scavengers and predators that emerged from the shadows\u2014feral gnolls, hungry trolls, cruel minotaurs, and far worse things. And the daelkyr aren't the only deadly powers in this place. There is an overlord bound beneath the Barrens, a force that thrives on brutal tyranny. This Horned King fueled the cruelty of the chibs, petty chieftains engaged in endless feuds. Over time, islands of civilization arose in this sea of chaos... The Venomous Demesne. The Znir Pact. The hidden changelings of Lost. The harpies of the high peaks. But these forces remained isolated and all but unknown to the people of the east, who saw only the violence of the chibs and the monstrosities roaming freely.",
								"With the rise of Galifar, Breland laid claim to all the lands west of Silver Lake. But this was just a word written on a map. Throughout the history of Galifar, there were only a handful of Brelish towns west of the Graywall Mountains. The largest of these was the town of Stubborn, which has since become Graywall; the Church of the Silver Flame established Brightstone Keep, which has since become Grimstone. But between the harsh nature of the land and the chaotic aggression of its inhabitants, the rulers of Galifar never considered it worth the effort to fully subjugate it.",
								"Centuries passed. New civilizations arose in the Barrens; the rise of the medusa city-state of Cazhaak Draal went entirely unnoticed by the people of the east. The region was simply a land of monsters, a place for eager templars to venture on bold quests. The denizens of the region were seen as too chaotic to pose any sort of serious threat to Galifar, and the Barrens had nothing of value. Then came the Last War. Galifar shattered into five nations. And along the edges of Khorvaire new nations seized the opportunity. The Mror dwarves declared independence. The Tairnadal elves and Ghaal'dar goblins laid claim to Valenar and Darguun. And in 986 YK, the Daughters of Sora Kell sacked the city of Stubborn and issued an ultimatum to the survivors. {@i \"Tell your rulers there's a new power in the west,\"} Sora Katra told the people of Stubborn. {@i \"What you've called the Barrens, we now name Droaam. The land beyond the Graywall and below the Byeshk belongs to our people. Withdraw yours quickly and respect our claim; next time, there will be no survivors.\"}",
								"The next decade saw a series of dramatic conflicts between Brelish soldiers under the leadership of Count ir'Blis and Droaamite forces. Breland struck at Turakbar's Fist. Droaamites razed villages around Orcbone. The struggle came to an end with the Mourning. As the nations of Khorvaire came together to craft the Treaty of Thronehold, the Daughters of Sora Kell sought a seat at the table. Their petition was denied. The people of the east wouldn't accept a nation of monsters; they were certain it would collapse within a few years. But in 998 YK, Droaam is stronger than ever... and people know it. The dragonmarked houses smell opportunity. Tharashk has found dragonshards and other valuable resources. Brelish nobles are offering veterans and refugees land in this region, drawing a new wave of settlers.",

The Barrens were once an important part of the Dhakaani empire, and there are fragments of the fallen civilization spread across the region. It's possible to find Dhakaani structures that are still intact, from small watchtowers to fortress cities like Cazhaak Draal or Shaarat Kol. But more often, adventurers will encounter remnants of structures destroyed by war and the passage of time, like the chunk of an ancient wall in the town of Quickstone. Keep in mind that Dhakaani architecture usually involved subterranean structures; what appears to be a devastated ruin could have intact vaults extending deep into the earth. And these in turn could have vile spores of Avassh, gargoyle servants of Orlassk, or other relics of the forces that destroyed Dhakaan. And finally, the Barrens holds a host of more recent ghost towns\u2014villages built by Brelish settlers and abandoned in response to the rise of Droaam, or chib camps abandoned under the new order. The Barrens are vast and largely uncharted.

On the other hand, the party could create an entirely new village or town that lies along the Border Road.

Do they sympathize with the Grizzlies or the Mourners? How do they feel about the rise of Main Street and the upcoming Kundarak enclave?

										"As a player character becomes wealthy and powerful, they may find some of the stories on the frontier to be less compelling. A 15th level Wizard with a purse full of diamonds won't have much trouble with a band of basic brigands. There are a few ways to handle this. The first is to shift rewards. \"Heart of Stone,\" the adventure included in this book, can carry characters to 5th level. This makes them quite capable by the standards of the Western Frontier. Moving forward, the DM could reduce XP rewards, cutting them by 50-75%; the characters will continue to advance, but slowly. Likewise, they may receive less gold than is typically assigned to the challenges they overcome. The point isn't to penalize the adventurers\u2014it's to give them different rewards. Rather than raw currency, rewards can be favors, improved reputation, useful magic items\u2014whether that's an experimental potion, a Dhakaani adamantine blade, or a golden fiddle from the Merchant of Misthaven\u2014or, potentially, Epic Boons or Supernatural Gifts. Adventurers who shatter Orlassk's cursed altar might receive a Supernatural Gift without explanation; is it a gift from the archfey King Grayfinger, a show of gratitude for cleansing the stone? Or is it the first manifestation of Orlassk's \"blessing\"\u2014which might soon become a curse?",

The point is that, as the economy of the Western Frontier operates at a lower level than Sharn or Fairhaven, the adventurers don't need a lot of gold for it to be significant. Likewise, they should feel that they are gaining useful things because of their victories\u2014but those can be favors or blessings rather than the ability to cast 7th level spells.",
										"This is an option, but it's not the only one. If a DM wants to run a higher level campaign on the Western Frontier, the challenges faced by the adventurers can evolve to match their power. Fiends could manifest through Rhesh Turakbar's Demonglass Warriors. Mordain the Fleshweaver could unleash deadly threats tailored specifically to challenge the adventurers. Orlassk could unleash a Stoneborn Tarrasque. These sorts of threats will certainly shift the tone of the campaign, but there are ways to challenge high-level characters."

A more severe injury could result in the loss of all or part of a limb; remember that Eberron: Rising from the Last War has Prosthetic Limbs! But scars don't have to be physical. A character could have a traumatic reaction to the source of their defeat; going forward, they suffer Disadvantage on ability checks or attack rolls directly related to the person or creature that scarred them. The damage could be to their reputation, as word of the defeat spreads and wherever they go, people bring up the story.

												"The Western Frontier lies between Breland, Droaam, and the Eldeen Reaches. Merchants are always happy to see Brelish coins or Kundarak letters of credit, but they're used to dealing with people from both sides of the road. Droaam has yet to mint currency. Bartering is a common practice in Droaamite daily life. Droaamite miners often trade using small chunks of precious metal or uncut gemstones. Droaamites also gamble and barter with bounty-marked teeth. The Daughters of Sora Kell offer bounties on certain dangerous creatures, paid for by the tooth. A Goblin symbol identifying the animal it's from is carved on each tooth, but most merchants won't accept teeth unless they personally recognize the tooth\u2014so you can't just carve \"wyvern\" on wolf teeth. While the DM could treat bounty-marked teeth as another form of coinage\u2014\"the old goblin offers three displacer beast teeth, worth 10 silver pieces\"\u2014adventurers who kill a dangerous monstrosity might wonder what the bounty is for their teeth. The DM could roll on the Individual Treasure tables in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide to determine the bounty offered for a creature of any CR. However, the tooth currency is based on the value the Daughters have placed on each bounty, and not every creature has a golden mouth. Some dangerous creatures might have a high value, while others are worthless. The bounty is a way to encourage the elimination of threats, and if a creature doesn't threaten the people of Droaam\u2014or is perhaps even an ally\u2014there won't be a bounty on its teeth. The people of the Venomous Demesne have their own forms of currency, including vials of blood charged with arcane energy and shards of crystalized souls; however, most people on the Western Frontier aren't willing to trade goods for a vial of pain-soaked blood."

A typical village might have a single representative of a Dragonmarked House\u2014a Sivis message station, a Jorasco healer, a Vadalis farrier, a Cannith smith\u2014while a larger town may have a few different dragonmarked heirs. Even so, there's a world of difference between the Jorasco Healing House you'll find in Wroat and the Patchery, the tiny clinic run by Daff d'Jorasco in the town of Quickstone. This can have a variety of effects. For one, the selection of goods is always more limited. In Quickstone, the blacksmith, Bel, can make you a Trident if you give her a day or two, but she doesn't have one just sitting on the rack ready for sale. And if you're not dealing with businesses licensed by dragonmarked houses, prices will often vary based on the perceived need and means of the customer. The upside to this is that you can occasionally find goods that aren't available in the standardized shops of the east. At the Patchery, Daff may only have a small supply of Potions of Healing available. But he could have a special potion he's mixed up using a byeshk infusion and a bit of what he's fairly certain was troll blood. He can't be sure what it will do until you drink it, but he thinks it's a potion of Heal. Do you want to buy it and find out? This idea goes even further in the markets of Droaam. Without the standards imposed by the Dragonmarked Houses, there's a lot of potential snake oil on the market. Some things might not work at all (\"It's not my fault! It's your thin human blood!\"); others might have remarkable effects that are more powerful than an adventurer could normally get at the price. Will they take a chance?",
												"A final point is that services may be sparse in the Western Frontier, but the Dragonmarked Houses are taking an interest. The town of Quickstone already has a Gold Dragon Inn, and House Kundarak is working on a vault enclave. Over the course of time, new services will become available, but is this a good thing? Do you actually want a Kundarak enclave in your town?"

Just because they can kill these cultists without consequences, is that the best answer? Ultimately, it's up to the DM to decide whether to encourage ruthless justice or to explore the broader consequences.

Maybe a cultist gives them an uncommon magic item\u2014a family heirloom\u2014in thanks for their freedom. Conversely, if adventurers do ruthlessly slay their enemies, they may see the consequences of Droaamite justice, as the friends or kin of their victims hunt them down, spread stories about them, or otherwise make life difficult. One such consequence is that an adventurer could be challenged to a duel. Overall, most people on the Western Frontier support dueling if the cause is seen as justified. If a wandslinger comes to town and declares that an adventurer killed his brother in a cowardly fashion and that the adventurer is currently wearing the brother's amulet, stolen from his corpse\u2014if the adventurer refuses to duel or cheats to win, they could quickly acquire an infamous reputation.

The idea isn't that a character with high Hit Points can simply laugh as someone stabs them over and over; it's that as long as they have Hit Points, they can avoid a lethal blow. Standard combat reflects the idea that combatants are dodging, parrying, and evading attacks even as they are losing Hit Points. People can and do fight challenges in the street using the normal rules of combat, which means they're dodging and moving and getting hit multiple times before they fall. But an arcane duel is an entirely different form of combat. It's about raw courage, speed, and skill: the courage to stand your ground, the speed to strike first, and the skill to land your spell. There's no dodging in a duel; you need to look your rival in the eye as you strike them down. Because of this, an arcane duel only involves a single attack from each combatant\u2014and that single blast can be deadly, regardless of how many Hit Points you possess.",

The medusas of Cazhaak Draal, the changelings of Lost, and the tieflings of the Venomous Demesne were isolated city-states, which avoided contact both with Breland and with one another. These cultures were all but unknown in the east, so the dominant impression of the region was of the chaotic chib culture. The Daughters of Sora Kell brought these diverse factions together. Force was a factor in the creation of Droaam, and fear of Maenya's Fist still plays an important role in keeping the old chibs in line. But the common depiction of Droaamites as squalid villages of goblins dominated by slow-witted ogres is driven by ignorance and Brelish propaganda. Under the Daughters of Sora Kell, each of the cultures of the region is a thread of a growing tapestry. New villages and towns are rising up from the Barrens, their construction driven by ogre strength, goblin enthusiasm, and the brilliant architects and masons of Cazhaak Draal. Magewrights from the Venomous Demesne are implementing an arcane infrastructure that could in time outshine the everyday amenities of the Five Nations. Droaam is a very young nation, still finding its footing and establishing traditions. But it is growing stronger every day, and it's only a matter of time until its great cities\u2014like Graywall and the Great Crag\u2014rival Wroat and Fairhaven. And it is this that is drawing the influx of travel and trade from the east; the glimpse of opportunities as Droaam grows and prospers.",
										"With that said, it is largely in the great cities\u2014such as Graywall, Vralkek, Cazhaak Draal\u2014that this renaissance is occurring. The Droaamites who dwell on the Western Frontier are remnants of the old system of chib rule, where a family of ogres or minotaurs would dominate a community of goblins and kobolds. Under the leadership of the Daughters, Droaamite workers are assured food, shelter, and security. Today, the chibs are expected to protect their people, not to oppress them; a modern chib serves as both mayor and sheriff. The Daughters are likewise encouraging the spread of Droaamite species into all communities. Though goblins may make up the majority of a village's population, there could be a harpy songbird in the inn, a tiefling magewright teaching a class of kobold sorcerers, and the old ogre chib may have been replaced by a wise medusa. So, at first glance, a Droaamite village in the Barrens might seem primitive... but look closer, and you'll see a well-fed population, working together to improve the conditions of the community. But again, this system is new and the idea of Droaam is still finding its footing along the border. The old chib system still lingers, especially in the villages around Turakbar's Fist; Rhesh Turakbar and his reavers still enforce order with force and fear.",
										"When dealing with a Droaamite community\u2014or envisioning the background of an adventurer from Droaam\u2014keep these things in mind. Droaam has only existed in its current form for a decade, and any villages along the Border Road will be younger than that. Because of this, a village will have been built for a reason\u2014taking advantage of water, a manifest zone, mineral deposits identified by House Tharashk, or something else that makes the spot worth building on. And more so than in the typical Brelish village, Droaamties often have a sense of hope; they are working together, and their nation is on the rise. The exception to this is in the vicinity of Turakbar's Fist. Here the villages are older, as Turakbar's Fist has dominated the region since before the rise of Galifar. And many of those villages are ruled by tyrannical chibs and weighed down by despair.",
										"Droaam has a few institutions that play a vital role in the nation, and whose agents can be encountered on the frontier.",
										"{@b {@i Katra's Voice}} is the diplomatic arm of Droaam, and Voices are envoys, entertainers, diplomats, and mediators. Their task is to maintain morale and lines of communication, and to help resolve disputes before they get out of hand. Agents of Katra's Voice are usually changelings, medusas, tieflings, or harpies. Many highlight their role as entertainers, sharing stories with the common folk and painting tales of the bright future that lies ahead. Others focus more on mediation, especially if there is unrest between the local chib and the inhabitants of the community. Katra's Voice also includes wandering magistrates, who typically travel with two soldiers of Maenya's Fist. The current fashion is for medusas to serve as magistrates; if they consider a plaintiff's complaint to be frivolous, they petrify them. However, there are a few changeling magistrates with exceptional telepathic abilities who excel at unraveling difficult situations.",
										"{@b {@i Maenya's Fist}} is the personal army of Sora Maenya, which acts to defend the nation and to enforce the rule of the Daughters when Katra's Voice fails to resolve an issue. The foundation of the Fist is a corps of armored war trolls and skullcrusher ogres that are fanatically devoted to Sora Maenya; a single war troll can scatter a band of insubordinate ogres. However, over the last decade, the Fist has expanded to include a broader range of forces, including centaur cavalry, air support from gargoyles and harpies, rangers and scouts drawn from the Dark Pack, and more. As a general rule, warlords are expected to use their own forces to maintain order in their domains; near Turakbar's Fist adventurers are more likely to encounter a band of minotaurs than a squad of Maenya's Fist. Fists are either dispatched directly by Sora Maenya to deal with known threats, or found in the company of a Voice or an Eye whose mission they are supporting. Consider them Droaam's answer to the Westwind Riders\u2014or in the case of a large company of Maenya's Fist, the equivalent of Breland bringing Argonth into play.",
										"{@b {@i Teraza's Eye}} gathers information for the Daughters, and its members serve as sages, inquisitives, and chroniclers. Droaam is a new nation, and the Daughters need to know if their experiment is working. Often, Eyes simply travel and observe, gathering information without interfering; if they uncover dangerous situations, they will call on the Voice or the Fist. However, they can be tasked to investigate intriguing mysteries\u2014typically supernatural threats, as diplomatic or judicial matters will be handled by Katra's Eyes.",
										"{@b {@i The Znir Pact}} is another force adventurers on the Western Frontier will come to know. These gnolls are mercenary soldiers. Half of the Pact has been hired by the Daughters to serve as general peacekeepers, supplementing the forces of the local warlord and dealing with troubles that don't require the full power of Maenya's Fist. Znir gnolls can also be found serving a local warlord. So Znir patrols can be found on the Border Road or on the old roads, but they will generally ignore adventurers unless there is a threat that needs to be dealt with.",
										"So, new villages are springing up along the Border Road. Graywall is expanding. The lightning rail is heading west. And a squad of Maenya's war trolls showing up should be legitimately frightening. {@i Droaam is on the rise.}",

												"One of the most distinctive elements of an adventure on the Western Frontier is the presence of Droaamite species traditionally thought of as monsters, whether as adventurers or as NPCs. Due to the efforts of House Tharashk, Droaamites are starting to appear in cities across the Five Nations. But on the Western Frontier, they are a part of everyday life. Travel on the Border Road, and you'll run into Znir patrols and wandering worgs. Stop in a village west of the road, and you'll find a harpy singing in the tavern, delighting a crowd of goblins and kobolds. Communities east of the road usually have a Brelish majority, but you may still find an ogre unloading crates from the Thunder Coach, a gargoyle watching from a roof, or a family of goblins starting a new life. This section provides a closer look at the species that are presented as character options in chapter 4, along with an overview of many other denizens of Droaam.

The wind carried her whispers through the stone, and the gargoyles perched on the walls and crouching in the corridors of the keep turned on the templars.",

And a few follow their own paths, driven by curiosity or by the bonds they've formed with places or people.

																"Evidence suggests that Dhakaani stoneworkers in the region became obsessed with these \"guardian statues\" in the decades leading up to the first open conflict with daelkyr forces... and it was during that battle that the daelkyr Orlassk breathed life into the countless guardians. Orlassk never controlled the gargoyles directly, but they came into existence with an instinctive revulsion for organic life, a reaction much like most humans have when encountering mold or viruses. Creatures of flesh are fundamentally repulsive, rotting monstrosities filled with disgusting fluids and leaking foul excrement. The first gargoyles lashed out against the dar surrounding them, and claimed the fortresses they had once guarded as their own. But they soon realized that they were vastly outnumbered by the creatures of flesh. Beyond this, they didn't need anything from the world beyond their walls. They didn't need food or other supplies. So they remained at their posts, and eventually fell into a deep torpor. In this state, their spark of life was so weak that they couldn't even be sensed by {@spell Detect Good and Evil|XPHB}, which is how the templars of Brightstone Keep failed to recognize them for what they were. But they were still aware of their surroundings on a deep level. When Katra spoke to the gargoyles of Brightstone, each heard something different, the perfect story to pull them from their slumber. Some heard tales of the wonders waiting to be seen out in the world. For others, she painted pictures of the excitement to be found in battle, or the satisfaction to be found in protecting someone one cares about. Her magic roused them, but not all the stone host joined the hag. A small force of gargoyles had heard the songs and teachings of the Silver Flame even while they slept, and found the vision of the Flame to be compelling. These gargoyles helped a group of friars escape and return to Flamekeep, where they have embraced the Silver Flame and fight alongside the templars to this day; these gargoyles are now known as the {@i wingwyrds}.",
																"Brightstone Keep wasn't the only place where Sora Katra woke slumbering gargoyles. There were a handful of other shunned keeps along the edge of the Byeshk Mountains, and Katra roused the gargoyles in each. And there was one place where some gargoyles were already awake: Cazhaak Draal, the city at the heart of the Stonelands. When the medusas laid claim to the city, their queen spoke to the slumbering gargoyles. Some chose to remain in their torpor, but a handful awoke and were eventually convinced to work with the medusas. It was through this alliance that the gargoyles learned how to reproduce, as described later in this article. Medusa and gargoyle alike chose to remain isolated from the warlike denizens of the Barrens, and the gargoyles of Cazhaak Draal rarely left the fortress city. But the Cazhaak gargoyles have been awake for over a century; they are more used to the world and to working side by side with organic creatures, and some have adopted the Cazhaak faith. When the Daughters of Sora Kell established a new province centered on the newly-christened Grimstone Keep and appointed Cairngorm to serve as warlord and guardian of the province, many of the gargoyles of Cazhaak Draal flocked to their new prince.",
																"In creating a gargoyle, consider which of these categories you fall into. Did you slumber in the ruins for thousands of years? Did you live alongside the medusas of Cazhaak Draal? Are you a newborn, hewn in the gravel pits of Cazhaak Draal and still crafting your final form? Or are you a gargoyle with no connections to Droaam whatsoever... a statue infused with life elsewhere in the world?"

																"Gargoyles are elemental creatures, and their physiology defies all natural laws. When a gargoyle stands still, it is indistinguishable from a stone statue. They are made of light, inanimate stone... And yet, when they choose to move, they can. This same illogic applies to their wings. Gargoyle wings can take many forms, but the vast majority couldn't possibly keep a gargoyle aloft, and yet somehow they fly. Some scholars believe the gargoyles fly through an instinctive manipulation of elemental air, but nothing has been proven. With that said, the fact that gargoyles have the elemental type doesn't mean that they have any planar connection or any bond to other elemental creatures. They are elementals because they are creatures of animate stone.",
																"The majority of gargoyles follow the model of the Dhakaani guardian statue\u2014the classic horned, bat-winged humanoid. However, this is only due to the fact that these statues were produced in mass quantities. Firstly, the Dhakaani gargoyles weren't stamped out of a mold. The horned, winged design is common, but some gargoyles have ram's horns, tribex horns, or no horns at all. Likewise, gargoyle wings can be long or ridiculously small, stone carved in the likeness of leather or feathers. Someone exceptionally versed in the history of Dhakaan could potentially identify the ruin a sleeper gargoyle comes from based on its artistic design. And yet, when Orlassk animated the statues of the Barrens, it affected more than just the guardians. There are wingless gargoyles carved in the shape of ancient Dhakaani heroes. The Dhakaani were especially infuriated by this mockery of their champions and made an extra effort to destroy these creatures, but there are still a few scattered among the host of Grimstone. In creating a gargoyle character, consider how your appearance reflects your choice of class. Unlike warforged, gargoyles weren't built for a specific purpose; the Dhakaani artisans had no idea their creations would come to life. But the material used or design of a gargoyle could influence its capability. A gargoyle Druid could be carved from densewood instead of stone, while a gargoyle Sorcerer could have dragonshards or slivers of demonglass incorporated into its stone body.",
																"This highlights the fact that not all gargoyles have wings. The classic Dhakaani guardian\u2014represented by the gargoyle stat block in the Monster Manual\u2014has wings and claws, and is formed from dense stone. But a gargoyle with the shape of a bugbear hero or a Cazhaak newborn may be made from softer stone and lack both claws and wings. These traits are reflected by the feats Wings of Stone and Hewn for Battle (see chapter 4). If your gargoyle character begins at a high level, you may start with these traits. If you're playing a 1st level gargoyle character, you have yet to assume your final form, or perhaps you've simply chosen not to add wings to your design.",
																"This choice is reflected in the way gargoyles reproduce and grow. Gargoyles have no functional reproductive organs. To reproduce, two or more gargoyles work together to carve an egg. During this ritual, they infuse the egg with a fraction of their own lifeforce. The egg is buried in a pit of gravel or stone shards. Over time, it absorbs the surrounding chunks of rock, instinctively assimilating these and reshaping them to build its own body. The appearance of a newborn gargoyle usually reflects a blending of its parents, but this is a foundation. Gargoyles don't need to eat, but a growing gargoyle will consume chunks of stone that will be added to its mass. As it continues to grow, its appearance will shift to match its own evolving self-image."

Guardians are typically stationary; these are the traditional gargoyles found on fortress walls, remaining perfectly still until something threatens their charge.

When playing a guardian gargoyle, consider: what drove your choice of ward? Could anything break this devotion?",
																		"{@b Thinkers} are rarely encountered, because even more than guardians, they often have no reason to move. A thinker enjoys contemplating weighty concepts.

As a gargoyle thinker, you are likely adventuring to gain access to new sources of information related to the topic that interests you. But whenever there is no need to move, you may fall into a still reverie; during downtime, you could spend days without moving, as you consider the information you've gained."

																"Most gargoyles have little interest in clothing or material possessions. There's very little that they need. However, one of the greatest challenges for a gargoyle is boredom. Rather than gold, gargoyles often want to be paid in stories, songs, or jokes; they then use these as social currency in dealings with other gargoyles. Most gargoyles are tone-deaf and struggle to master musical pursuits, but the rare gargoyle bards and entertainers are held in high regard."

														"The first gnolls were born in the Age of Demons, a product of the endless war between Rak Tulkhesh and the Wild Heart. Even after the overlords were bound, their fiendish influence drove gnolls to engage in vicious acts of brutality. For countless generations, gnolls fought trolls, ogres, other gnolls, and any other creatures they could find, seeking blood for their hungry idols. But in time, leaders arose who urged their clans to resist the call of endless war. They dragged their idols to the place now known as Znir (\"Stone\") and shattered them. Though they might be many clans, from this day forward, they would be one pack. They would allow no one\u2014not chib, god, or demon\u2014to hold dominion over them. This was easier said than done. Fighting the fiendish influence within was challenging enough, but the Barrens were a chaotic tapestry of battling forces. The leaders of the newly forged Znir Pact had no desire to rule over other creatures, but even holding territory could invite attack. And so they developed the path that has carried them forward to this day: the road of the mercenary. The gnolls would claim no territory beyond the lands around Znir. They would fight for any who would pay a fair price. But if anyone sought to enslave a gnoll, or to strike against Znir itself, they would face the wrath of all the united clans. This was a lesson that had to be taught many times, but after a century or so, the point was made. To those who paid them, the gnolls were as reliable as stone. Those who betrayed them or who picked a fight would fall before the might of the full Pact. They have followed this path ever since. One could look at the Pact and say that they serve many masters.

																"The Znir gnolls include a dozen different clans, each of which holds distinct traditions.

All gnolls skillfully hunt and fight, but the Barrakas are known to be the finest trackers of the Pact; the Aryth, the deadliest archers; the Olarune, the strongest warriors and most forceful in the vanguard. Typically, mercenary units are composed of gnolls of a single clan, assigned based on the nature of the task that lies ahead, and contracts are usually negotiated for a period based on the cycles of the clan's moon. The clans maintain distinct territories within the Znir region, but all gnolls are welcome around the hearth of any clan; the Znir take pains to crush any tension that arises between the clans. Shamans and leaders from each clan maintain a council at the Znir, around the broken idols. Here they mediate disputes, assign contracts to clans, and allocate funds and equipment. The Eyre clan has honed their skills as smiths and tanners, and they craft much of the equipment used by the Znir gnolls\u2014though there is still a strong tradition of scavenging among the Znir, and warriors often claim trophies from fallen foes.",
																"The Znir defied the overlords when they shattered their statues, but there's still a spark of a fiend in the blood of each gnoll. Young gnolls learn how to resist this influence\u2014to channel the strength of the fiend without giving it power over them. For most gnolls, this is a matter of discipline; Znir gnolls are known for remaining calm in the face of provocation, and having learned to fight their own demons, they aren't easily manipulated by mortals. However, some gnolls learn to draw on their unnatural heritage and to channel this power in useful ways. Znir gnolls have their own equivalents of rangers and barbarians; the ranger's primal magic draws on the Wild Heart, while the barbarian channels the fury of the Rage of War. Znir shamans are similar to warlocks, typically following the path of the Fiend. However, in all of these examples, the Znir don't serve the dark power. Rather, they can be seen as stealing their strength from it; learning to draw on it without giving anything in return. In their determination not to let fiendish forces hold dominion over their people, the Znir gnolls have also developed their own techniques for fighting supernatural threats. Champions trained to face fiends and undead are known as hwyri\u2014Gnoll for \"warden\"\u2014and wield powers similar to those of paladins in other lands. However, hwyri don't worship any divine power. Their abilities come from training and understanding of the demon within; they aren't crusaders, they're mercenary demon hunters. Most hwyri come from the Vult clan, and in a land that shuns the Silver Flame, these gnolls can be the best hope for people facing fiendish threats."

In addition to those who serve through House Tharashk or Daask, a number of Znir have been sent east to study the Five Nations, gathering knowledge of its people and customs so the Znir council can determine how to engage with the wider world.

Functionally, a myrnaxe is a Battleaxe, but it can be used to inflict either Slashing damage (with the axeblade) or Piercing damage (with the spearhead).

																"The most important identifier for a Znir gnoll is its whoop. While deceptively short, a whoop includes a range of ultrasonic inflections that indicate clan, a personal identifier, and a suggestion of family affiliation (the Znir trace lineage through the mother). Because it's impossible for most nongnolls to properly replicate a whoop, gnolls also use contract names\u2014names intended to be used with clients and other outsiders. There is a basic structure of contract names used by all gnolls; the inflection of the name indicates gender, though few people recognize this if they don't speak Gnoll. The Znir typically attach clan name to a formal introduction: \"Ghyrryn Barrakas, Znir.\"",

																		"A typical gnoll stands over seven feet in height, but this is belied by their hunched posture. Males and females are similar in appearance, and other species have difficulty telling them apart. Gnolls have thick fur over their bodies; depending on the clan, this can be uniform in color, or broken up with spots or stripes. Their eyes are yellow or green, and gleam with reflected light. While these are common traits, the fiendish heritage of the gnoll sometimes manifests itself in its appearance. An unusual gnoll could have glowing red eyes, fur with stripes that glow like flames, or other unusual traits. Typically, these don't grant special abilities, though you could attribute a class ability or feat to such a mutation."

																		"Gnolls possess powerful jaws, as reflected by their Bite attack. They can chew through and digest bone, and dislike letting food go to waste. When feral gnolls raid a village, they consume even the bones of their victims. Znir gnolls won't eat their fallen foes if they're in the company of creatures who are uncomfortable with such behavior. But they often eat a small piece of any creature they slay\u2014even if it's just a finger\u2014to form a bond with the victim. The Znir believe that those you kill wait for you in the realm of death, and honoring them ensures that they won't be hungry when you travel to that land."

Znir gnolls won't deceive members of their pack; if there are problems, they call them out directly. If a gnoll character adopts a group of adventurers as their temporary pack, these things apply to the other characters\u2014but the gnoll will be surprised and angry if their non-gnoll packmates don't show them the same respect."

However, gnolls themselves don't consider casual intimidation to be a hostile act; it's just a way to establish a place in the hierarchy of the pack, largely ignored once that hierarchy is established.

Gnolls work together as a pack, always searching for weaknesses in enemies and supporting injured allies. Znir gnolls won't break their word, but they don't hold to any idea of honorable conduct on the battlefield; they are ruthless and efficient, and see nothing wrong with ambushing or tricking a superior foe. Some gnolls have a supernatural knack for mimicry (which could be represented by the use of Minor Illusion or the Actor feat) and use this gift to draw enemies into danger."

They don't judge people by appearance or by their beliefs; just as they put up with demon-worshiping minotaurs in Droaam, a Znir hwyri can work alongside a templar of the Silver Flame or a warforged paladin of Dol Arrah. They may not like the people they are working with, and they may think that the beliefs of their companions are vile or foolish.

																		"The Gnoll language is unique, with a range of pitches that are difficult for humans to hear, let alone duplicate. At first, it sounds much like the vocalizations of hyenas, with whining and chattering \"laughter.\" It's possible for non-gnolls to learn Gnoll, but it's a difficult feat. When stealth isn't necessary, the Znir are often quite vocal in battle; they generally coordinate actions and confirm positions with short bursts in Gnoll. Each Znir gnoll has a whoop, a unique call it uses as a sort of verbal signature; while these are extremely short, they convey both personal identity and clan loyalty. These are used to coordinate in the field, and it's common for a gnoll to whoop when entering a friendly location, as a simple way of identifying itself and giving allies an opportunity to respond. Beyond this, body language and posture\u2014usually slumped\u2014are an important part of gnoll communication; for example, when a gnoll feels threatened or angry, its thick crest of fur down the spine rises. The Znir dislike written communication, though they use it for contracts."

However, the 2024 version of the fifth edition Player's Handbook introduces Weapon Masteries\u2014properties that reflect the full potential of a weapon, which can be unlocked by a skilled combatant. Adding Mastery properties to Arcane Focuses is a way to embrace the concept that Wands and the like are weapons in Eberron and to provide a distinct flavor to each focus. With these rules, the Wand is swift and vexing, the Rod staggers a target with brute force, and the Staff shoves them back with the power of its blast.",
