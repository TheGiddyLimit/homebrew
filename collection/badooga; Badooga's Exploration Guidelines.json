It lists out the rules that govern interacting with and traveling through the wilderness, and it gives a step by step guide on how to run exploration and travel on a day by day basis.",

However, keeping up with a rate of about three encounters per day slows travel down to a crawl, turning most journeys into a bit of a slog. The alternative is to only run about one encounter per day, which doesn't properly challenge the party and should be avoided at all times.",
										"Luckily, the {@variantrule Rest Variants|dmg|Gritty Realism} resting variant can be used to stretch the length of an adventuring day across multiple in-game days, allowing the DM to run one encounter per in-game day with no issues. However, if the party happens to discover a dungeon while exploring, gritty realism will not be adequate. You could switch between the two rulesets as needed, but that isn't a good option for all games. The best solution is a new rest variant that is similar to gritty realism, but can accomodate for changes in encounter pacing without too many issues."

										"However, many character features allow the party to trivialize survival with ease. With just a single 1st-level spell slot, the {@spell goodberry} spell can provide nourishment to the entire party for an entire day. By spending 11 minutes to cast the {@spell Leomund's tiny hut} spell, the party bard or wizard can provide the entire party with a safe place to sleep for the night. The Natural Explorer class feature allows a ranger that is in their favored terrain to find twice as much food while foraging, and also invalidates many of the other aspects of exploration discussed earlier."

										"While these weather phenomena and wilderness hazards presented in the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|dmg} are adequate enough in normal situations, they fail to acknowledge one simple fact: in a world of dragons, fiends, and magic, surviving in the wilderness requires adventurers to face off against fantastical effects and supernatural hazards. If this is the case, why are most of the natural hazards in the DMG mundane in nature? While some 5e books seek to address this (e.g. {@adventure Tasha's Cauldron of Everything|tce} includes a selection of supernatural environments), it is still a shame that almost all of the natural hazards in the DMG are things that could easily be found in real life."

These mods aren't for everyone, but can be very fun if configured correctly.",
										"For D&D, this shows that while optional rules for survival aspects of the game can and should be provided, the main way to make exploration more challenging is to address combat. To do this, we can make a resting variant that extends the length of the adventuring day to not require an unreasonable number of encounters per in-game day.

										"For D&D, the main way to address this is to rewrite the rules for becoming lost. Having to constantly roll to not be lost sucks. Instead, maybe we can allow the navigator to find shortcuts that get the party past obstacles and cut down on total travel time. To keep things realistic and fair, we can lower the party's normal travel pace while in the wilderness to offset that.

										"For D&D, we can emulate this by not simply allowing players to discover all locations automatically. Instead, there should be a scouting activity that allows a character to scout for nearby locations of interest. We can also add one that allows a character to gather information on the region that, in addition to being a worldbuilding tool, can help in finding nearby locations of interest.

A free spell added to their spell list or automatically learned generally won't impact a spellcaster's power levels, but is still a great reward through the opportunity for extra worldbuilding or extra flavor given to the spellcaster.",

For example, a primal spirit could grant the party sorcerer access to the {@spell speak with plants} spells as a reward for protecting their nature grove from undead. Be creative with how you give out such spells, and be sure to discern the power level of a specific spell before you give it out to the party.",

Unlike an abbey, a temple does not have integrated housing; instead, its members may live in a nearby town or city. However, a temple is typically large enough to house additional services such as schooling and aid for the povershed, rather than just a place of worship as a normal church might have. Like an abbey, adventurers may go to a temple in search of divine spellcasting services or for specialized guidance relating to the temple's religious focus. In times of need, civilians may gather at a temple to be healed from a plague or for divine protection from external threats."

Depending on the method of construction, its width, and the number of fortifications surrounding it, a fortified tower can range from a few stories high to being taller than any building in the surrounding region. Adventurers may visit a tower for a variety of reasons, but their small horizontal size makes them easy to place in remote locations that are far away from civilization.

This value represents a rough minimum for the \"budget\" you, as the DM, have when placing strongholds in the region. For example, a town of 5,000 people living with a comfortable lifestyle (1 gp/day) has a \"stronghold budget\" of 100,000 gp, meaning that it can possibly have one temple, one fort, one tower, three guildhalls, and one trading post.",

That is, the players should establish their expectations and desires for the specific gameplay mechanics they like or dislike, the tone of the story and how involved that story is, and the overall type of game they want to play in.

However, if the party knows that one path leads through the snowy mountains and the other through the dark forest, this same choice becomes much more important for the party to make.",
										"In general, having proper information gives the party at least some control over the consequences of their choices, making it more satisfying when such choices lead to success. When exploring, the activities that the party can do while traveling can and should grant them some sort of information about the area surrounding them, which in turn allows them to decide which activities they should do next. This gameplay loop defines the core of the exploration pillar, which is defined by discovery and finding new things."

Doesn't this just serve to waste the party's time? Failure shouldn't interrupt progression, and instead should be a catalyst for it. This is the essence of failing forward.",
										"For example, suppose the party is lost in a forest, and keeps failing their rolls to regain their bearings. Instead of having them wander endlessly until they get back on track, allow them to stumble upon a hidden location or path that they otherwise would not have found. This hidden location or path can then lead to plenty of fun adventures, without the immersion of being lost ever breaking."

For example, suppose the party suffers one level of exhaustion due to a lack of food while exploring. This encourages them to forage for more food, but the very first level of exhaustion already imposes disadvantage on ability checks, making it much harder to succeed at foraging. In other words, the condition encourages a certain action to be taken against it, but simultaneously discourages that action via disadvantage on the check for it.",
