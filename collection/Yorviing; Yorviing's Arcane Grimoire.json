						"Welcome, dear reader, to Yorviing's Arcane Grimoire, a tome holding a large quantity of arcane themed player options for the greatest roleplaying game ever made. Inside these pages, you will find many Arcane Traditions for wizards, multiple spells, magical items, roll tables, backgrounds, and much, much more.",

There are subclasses for wizards (and even a few that are not for wizards) to create characters, spells to grant spellcasters and wielders of magic, magical items that can be found, purchased, or gifted to players, roll tables to help flesh out a character's backstory, personality, and worldview, and even setting neutral factions that a Dungeon Master can incorporate into their world or a campaign, either as a preexisting one or as one the players perhaps strive to create or bring back.",
						"Yorviing's Arcane Grimoire, or YAG for short, is meant for both players and DMs to help them in creating more characters and character concepts and to bring more arcane elements into a story or world.",
						"This project has been my biggest focus over the course of the past year, starting in early 2019 and working its way up till now. I have been working to bring this project to life, playtesting, revising and editing as much as I can to present a homebrew compendium worth having.",
						"I had much help along my journey to creating this project, from many helpful homebrewers to communities that provided feedback in various forms. Without them, this project would not exist, and I have all of them to thank for this journey (you can find out more about the ones who helped me in Part 10 of this book).",
						"Yorviing's Arcane Grimoire is dedicated to a few different people.",
						"Firstly, this book is dedicated to my wife Chelsea, without whom I would not have had the encouragement and joy to continue this project when I went through some dark times. I love you, Sweetie Pea.",
						"Second, this book is dedicated to the members of the greatest players I ever had the pleasure of DMing in a homebrew world called 'Yvarra'; Ben, Brandy, Chris, Dan, Kevin, Korrigan, Mallory, Nathan, Shelly, and Tate. We're going back one day.",
						"Third, this book is dedicated to the r/UnearthedArcana subreddit for all of their feedback and support, as well as anyone who follows me on Reddit. Y'all keep on brewing.",
						"Lastly, I do want to preface by saying that while I put a lot of time and energy into the contents of this book, there are certainly going to be things that are not going to be fully balanced and perfect. While I was able to playtest and refine a lot of this book's contents, some things are do slip through the cracks. I am hoping that anyone who playtests anything in this book, from subclasses to spells, let's me know via Reddit any feedack you gather, from positive to constructive criticism.",

								"Quantumurgy is a new school of magic, heavily influenced and inspired by mechanics, properties, and theories that are prevalent within quantum physics and quantum mechanics. Many of these spells are inspired by a particular phenomena regarding quantum mechanics, such as quantum tunnelling, and others are inspired by properties regarding atomic and nuclear technology.",
								"This school of magic is meant to serve as a more 'futuristic' style of magic, though while it will be more at home in a sci-fi or futuristic setting or world, it can be used in standard medieval fantasy worlds as well as a newly discovered branch of magic.",
								"When Quantumurgy is implemented in futuristic settings, it can be made to be as common as other forms of magic, such as evocation or transmutation. There may even be a rich tradition of quantum mages that are seen as equals to abjurers or conjurers. Quantumurgy can be seen as a way of understanding the arcane energies that lie at the subatomic levels of the universe and of all things, and thus may lead to both academic and mystic interpretations of how this school of magic is used and studied.",
								"When Quantumurgy is implemented in older, medieval styled settings, this school of magic can be seen as a newly discovered form of magic that wizards have stumbled upon, or can even be ancient, long forgotten magic that otherworldly beings may pass on to those who seek the power that lies in quantumurgy. Perhaps this magic is granted as a special boon to a warlock who has served their patron well. Or, perhaps quantumurgy is a school of magic that has only been discovered by wizards, thus only wizards may have access to these spells.",

								"{@i Of all the wonders I have seen in my life, none have struck me with a sense of awe more than that of the Ovriel Academy. The first time I laid my eyes upon its multitude of spires, its grand halls, and the rooms upon rooms where all manner of magical experimentation and learning was taking place, my breath was taken away from me. Never has there been an institution so dedicated to the discovery and learning of all things magical. From its lowest levels to its highest towers, students of the arcane were toiling away over ancient tomes, beakers filled with strange liquids and gases, and inscribing spells and sigils upon all manner of materials. My guide, the dear Elistra Alixandre, as part of my tour of the grand keep, took me through a maze of hallways and corridors to a large lecture hall deep underground, where we sat in earnest and wonder at a presentation in which an old orcish wizard displayed his findings on the works of the Yune, the greatest wizard in the land. After which, Elistra showed me a room where students were learning how to summon corpses. Corpses! I was told that no magic is off limits in the Academy to study, so long as it follows particular guidelines. I was amazed at the level of variety and splendid magics that I saw there, and am eagerly looking forward to the day where I can return as a student myself.}",
								"-Frederick Tomunil, author of the 'Olean Manuscript'",
								"",
								"The Ovriel Academy is considered by many to be the greatest institution of magical learning ever created. Adhering to a progressive ideology of 'any magical learning is good magical learning', the Academy has been the home of many of the world's greatest wizards. Within its walls of old and weathered stone, students can study and practice any school or form of magic, with only a small number of restrictions which must be adhered to.",
								"The Academy's acceptance of magic of all kinds and origins has led to the creation of incredible and influential works of arcane understanding and theory. From works that discussed the finer elements of wielding the power of fire, to a series of documented experiments detailing the methods of how to obtain extensive knowledge of the future, the students, instructors, and alumni of the Academy are heralded as being the mightiest wizards and scholars of the arcane alive.",
								"However, while the Academy's tolerance for a variety of magic is unprecedented in the world of arcane academics, there are those that see this form of progressive thinking and experimentation as going too far, or perhaps being too dangerous. Critics of the Academy state that allowing for the practice of dark arts such as necromancy or even 'fleshwarping' in addition to the classical instruction of spells of a destructive or manipulative nature allows for the harboring of twisted and potentially dangerous individuals to only grow stronger and more powerful. The Academy, however, has continued to deny this, stating that it is precisely this form of open tolerance towards magic that will prevent the improper use and execution of dangerous magic.",

Students are expected to develop a clear understanding of both the arcane arts and technological works, and be able to demonstrate an understanding of theory, application, and successful execution. Examples of Arcane Traditions that can be associated with this course: AT: Clocksmith, AT, Metallurgy, AT: Quantumurgy.",
										"{@b On Arcane Warfare.} This course is dedicated to the understanding and developing of techniques wherein magic and spellcasting are combined with elements of warfare, such as combat expertise, an understanding of military tactics, and defensive maneuvers. Students will be instructed in both the theory and practical execution of magical warfare, and are expected to maintain a dedicated schedule composed of physical training and exercise alongside the knowledge of warfare. Examples of Arcane Traditions that can be associated with this course: AT: Arcane Knight, AT: Arcane Marksman, AT: Incarceration.",

Students are required to have a firm understanding of the nature of magics such as enchantment, necromancy, and curses, their application, worldviews and cultural views on these magics, and a dedication to learning how to wield these types of magic. Examples of Arcane Traditions that can be associated with this course: AT: Fleshwarping, AT: Haemomancy, AT: Hexmastery.",
										"{@b Naturae Arcana.} This course focuses on utilizing elements of nature, such as the elements themselves, or even aspects of nature (such as flora and fauna), in conjunction with arcane spellcasting.

Examples of Arcane Traditions that can be associated with this course: AT: Arbormancy, AT: Astrology, AT: Windbringer.",
										"{@b Magical Theory and the Soul.} This course will provide an arena wherein students are asked to discuss and study various theories related to the mind, the soul, magic, and the ideologies that drive them and contribute to the overarching body of works related to these fields. Students are expected to develop a thesis or theory related to one or more of these fields, as well as be able to demonstrate spellcasting and abilities that convey this understanding. Examples of Arcane Traditions that can be associated with this course: AT: Philosophy, AT: Recollection, AT: Soul Sage.",
										"{@b Experimental Development.} This course is dedicated to allowing for students to create or study forms of magic that are considered new, experimental, or untraditional. Students are expected to utilize their creativity and dedication to perfect and/or develop styles and applications of magic, and be able to demonstrate their usefulness, their general application, the philosophies backing these new forms of magic, and the general and specific applications of these magics.

There, we saw who we were hoping to meet; a witch, adorned in furs and dark grey cloaks. Her right hand gripped a long quarterstaff, upon which feathers and bones hung from a jagged crystal tip. Her hair, thick and wild like that of the mane of a black lion, obscured much of her face, though through that darkened canopy I could see her eyes. The two haunting yellow eyes shone curiously bright, and as the first few drops of rain began to fall from the sky, her left hand emerged from within her cloak, beckoning us into the heart of the forest. \"Come,\" she began, \"let me show you what the world has forgotten.\"}",

Some covens, however, are more generous and kind, serving as a voice of wisdom and council to small villages and hamlets.",

To the former, all witch covens maintain a connection to special magic, and make sure that it does not fall into the wrong hands. The magic that a coven can hold and protect can be as varied as the covens themselves, though all covens protect their secrets from all outsiders, and occasionally from other covens as well. To the latter, all witch covens work together under a set of ancient laws known as the Code of Covens. It is through these laws that witches have each other's backs in times of peace or peril.",

Such a goal could be uniting to fight against a zealous inquisition, or because of a rare magical event, such as a Bloodmoon or the sprouting of an ancient tree.",
										"Below are a handful of sample covens that can be used within a world. These examples will give a basic description of the coven, their style of magic, and their general attitudes.",
										"{@b Coven of Lies.} The Coven of Lies is one of the most feared covens in the land. Witches who belong to this coven often summon great spiders to aid them in battle, and are known for their use of deadly poisons. What makes them dangerous, however, is their ability to move stealthily and to be patient. Many witches in this coven use spiders to spy upon others, seeing through the eyes of a spider while it sits patiently in the webs in the corners of dark rooms or forests.",
										"{@b Coven of Might.} The Coven of Might lives up to their namesake by training in the art of combat and acquiring power through whatever means necessary. These witches will often hone their skills in weaponry, and may even don armor in warfare. Their greatest strength, however, comes from their ability to draw allies to their cause and to have others work alongside of them. Great minotaur and mighty beasts will follow these witches to achieve whatever goal they are after.",
										"{@b Coven of Oak.} The Coven of Oak is one that practices what is known as 'green magic', a type of magic that controls and wields the magical strength of nature itself. Often one of the more peaceful covens, witches within this group tend to wild areas of nature and help protect it. They get along more easily with druids than some other witch covens may, and they are known to be guardians of ancient natural sites, such as mighty old trees or an oasis within a vast desert.",
										"{@b Coven of Light.} The Coven of Light is one of the more recognized covens, and favorably so. Many of these witches will offer their services to heal and help others with their ailments, wounds, or other aspects of their lives. They are often the coven that will live the closest to civilization, and in some cases small hamlets will even spring up around their settlements to protect them in exchange for their aid. These witches are sometimes known as 'good witches' or 'witch-doctors'.",
										"{@b Coven of Seas.} The Coven of Seas is one of the more nomadic covens, and they travel either on the oceans or journey up the lengths of coasts as the seasons change. They are practitioners of ancient oceanic magic, often using salt, seaweed, and shells in their rituals and spellcasting. They can be as unpredictable as the sea itself, offering aid and guidance through rivers or stormy seas, or can be malevolent deceivers, guiding many a would be voyage to their doom amongst the depths.",
