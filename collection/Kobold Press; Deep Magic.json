Whether it lives or dies, its struggles ultimately shake the web in its entirety, and it might free itself through such effort. The struggle affects all things, however remotely connected they might be, whereas the insect that merely accepts its death leaves not even a ripple behind.

				"Most angelic scribes take up their craft out of reverence and a desire to protect the righteous; a few tempt angelic wrath with their lust for power that's otherwise beyond their grasp. How to Start: If you're a wizard who wants to become an angelic scribe, you make that decision upon reaching 2nd level, when you are also entitled to choose an arcane tradition. If you decide to follow the path of the angelic scribe exclusively, you can forego the selection of an arcane tradition and gain the features of the angelic scribe specialty instead.",
				"You can also pursue the angelic scribe specialty in conjunction with one of the standard arcane traditions. If you choose to do this, you gain the Savant feature of your chosen school in addition to Angelic Savant (described below). Also at 2nd level, you choose whether to gain Seal Scribe (see below) or the 2nd-level feature of your chosen school. Thereafter, at 6th, 10th, and 14th level, you choose between the lowest-level features still available. For instance, a conjurer might select Seal Scribe at 2nd level and Minor Conjuration at 6th level, followed by either Warding Seal or Benign Transposition at 10th level.",
				"For a cleric, the process is much the same except that it involves making choices between angelic scribe features and the features provided by your domain. These decisions occur at 2nd, 6th, 8th, and 17th level instead of at the levels indicated for wizards.",
				"Paladins, although they can cast angelic spells and gain angelic feats, cannot become angelic scribes."
