Instead of protecting nature by preserving the spaces untouched by civilization, they bring nature to the spaces where people live, and seek to establish a symbiotic relationship between mankind and the natural world. They see villages, towns, and cities as ecosystems in their own right, no different from a forest, jungle, or desert. These Druids forgo the secrecy and reclusiveness that most druidic circles hold dear and sacred, and replace it with what they see as a stronger force better able to enact long-lasting change: community. They are pillars of these communities, establishing and preserving green spaces that not only bring nature into the day-to-day lives of the city's inhabitants, but also double as useful tools for the residents.",

Their mission is not to create a space for nature inside of a city, but to erase the line between nature and city completely.",

				"Your familiarity with the arcane art of summoning familiars allows you to call forth a spirit in a form stronger than that of your fellow Wizards' familiars.",
				"You know the {@spell Find Familiar} spell, you always have it prepared, and it does not count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. You can cast Find Familiar with a casting time of one action a number of times per day equal to your Intelligence modifier. When you do so, you do not consume any material components in the casting of the spell, and the familiar you summon uses a different stat block and has abilities—outlined in this arcane tradition—that are not normally granted by the Find Familiar spell.",
                "When you summon your Enhanced Familiar, you choose which abilities it has by selecting one of the available stat blocks. See the game statistics in the Enhanced Familiar stat blocks below, which use your {@variantrule Proficiency|XPHB|Proficiency Bonus} (PB) in several places. Your Enhanced Familiar takes the form of an animal, though with some telltale sign of its arcane nature. What kind of animal form it takes depends on which Enhanced Familiar stat block you choose. For example, choosing the {@creature Enhanced Familiar (Flying)|PointyHatArcaneCodex} stat block makes your Enhanced Familiar capable of flight, so it may take the form of an owl whose feathers sport the pattern of a shifting star map, or a great moth with the phases of the moon stamped on its wings.",
                "In combat, your Enhanced Familiar shares your {@variantrule Initiative|XPHB} count, but takes its turn immediately after yours. It can move and use its {@variantrule Reaction|XPHB} on its own, but the only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a {@variantrule Bonus Action|XPHB} on your turn to command the familiar to take a different action. The stat block chosen dictates which actions the Enhanced Familiar can take. If you're incapacitated, the Enhanced Familiar can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge.",
                "If your Enhanced Familiar is reduced to 0 Hit Points, it disappears. You can cast the spell Find Familiar using this feature to summon it again. Whenever you cast the Find Familiar spell using this feature, you can choose to summon your Enhanced Familiar using a different Enhanced Familiar stat block.",
                "You regain all uses of this feature at the end of a {@variantrule Long Rest|XPHB}."

However, it is very much possible—albeit rarer—for them to be born of different schools of magic.",

Their skin glows with the text of the spell in question or the magic circles and runes that were used during the casting process. Some arcaneborn have been used as living spell scrolls because of this feature, becoming guardians of specific spells and testing wizards who wish to learn the magic that shines through their skin.",

An arcaneborn born of a spell that used flowers in its casting might manifest those same flowers around themselves as a reflection of the spell that made them an arcaneborn.",

				"The legends are true: dwarves are made of stone. Or rather, they once were. They were extracted from the earth from precious stones and molded into their shape by the gods who lovingly gave them sentience. But the shape they molded dwarves into significantly differs from the one we know today.",
				"Dwarves in the past were made of stone or metal, and this led to two distinct appearances. Those who could trace their lineage to stone had skin that shone like minerals and was veined like marble, and the gemstone used in their creation grew on their heads like hair. Those who were instead born from metal had a metallic luster and shine to their skin, and molten metal flowed from their scalp and their lower jaw instead of hair.",
				"At this stage of dwarven history, dwarves mined not for crafting, but for reproduction. They found gemstones and infused them with magic so that they would one day grow into another dwarf. And the magic they used was none other than arcane magic. The dwarves once worshipped a dwarven deity of the arcane, but also of fertility, since this was how they reproduced. This god was a motherly figure, to contrast Dwarven God's paternal place in the pantheon, and the arcane was associated not only with knowledge but child-rearing.",
				"It was through this deity's guidance that the dwarves mastered the art of the arcane, and then turned it from an art to a science. At this point in time, magic practitioners could only ask the Weave to do as they wanted. The dwarves, on the other hand, made the Weave do what they wanted. They were crafters like the dwarves of today, but crafters of spells; they were the first to jot down formulas and measure arcane components to record the first spells. And they used what was most at hand to craft their spells: the gemstones and metals that made up their own bodies. They chiseled the gems of their beards and poured the metal of their hair, and with those ingredients, they made magic. Under the guiding hand of their arcane god, they became the first arcane experts.",
				"And then, this deity vanished. There is a gap in the records of the dwarves. A gap wide enough to have made them forget they were even born of the stone. Their previous appearance and way of life was sundered, erased along with this mysterious deity and their even more mysterious death.",
				"Whatever the reason for their disappearance, something had severed the connection between dwarves and the arcane completely. No longer able to harvest magic components from their own bodies and with no divine guidance to practice magic—not even able to remember that they once did—one might think dwarves would simply forget spellcraft and the arcane.",
				"But the industrious spirit is stronger than the hardest stone. Dwarves turned back to mining, not for child-rearing but to find the gemstones and metals they once came from; to follow the spells they had once written themselves, despite not remembering doing so. Where once they had crafted spells, dwarves now learned to craft artefacts. In time, over centuries, the dwarves found their own way to the arcane again.",
				"Nowadays, few dwarven scholars even believe the dubious theory that dwarves come from stone, and even fewer of them believe that dwarves were once metallic or stone-like in appearance. But the newly found arcane connection that the dwarves have forged has awakened something within them. There are talks of dwarves born of wizard parents who sport gems on their heads and beards, or molten metal as hair. There are even rumours of clans of ancient dwarves who still have the appearance that all dwarves once did, encased in the stone, dormant. Preserved like veins of precious metals and gems, ready for their brethren to mine deeper and liberate them from their earthen prison, so that they may tell the story of what exactly happened to the dwarven people."

There have been reports of familiars awakening after centuries of service to one master, the residual magic of countless summonings and various other spells building up to become the familiar's own magical power. Awakenings have also been reported after a familiar has suffered prolonged abuse from its master, finally finding the strength to rebel against them and sever the connection between summoned creature and summoner. There have even been cases where a familiar has awakened after the death of its master, being so paradoxically devoted to them that the familiar liberated itself from the summoning spell that bound it to the arcanist in order to find a way to bring its master back to life.",

No longer does the familiar have to answer the commands of the one that brought it to this plane; instead, the familiar is now in complete control of its own destiny — or rather, their own destiny. What they do with their newly found free will after awakening is for the awakened familiar to decide."

There are even tales of people who were awful to cats and turned into felis as a punishment, forced to be what they despise most. Nowadays, however, most felis are just born from the union of two felis parents.",

Most often, their ancestry manifests as feline ears like those of a house cat or a lynx; a feline tail; a cat's nose; sharp, claw-like nails; whiskers; or a combination of those. Felis believe that the more cat traits one has, the more they are favored by their god.",

It's seen as greatly shameful for a felis to depend on anyone but themselves, and felis children leave the nest extremely early in order to make their own luck in the world. It's not out of the ordinary to see a felis teen already tending to their own shop or embarking on an adventure. This cultural push to be independent can make others see them as individualistic, even selfish, but those who form a bond with a felis quickly understand that they enjoy companionship just as much as anyone else—they just have their own way of showing it. Their need to be self-reliant does not mean that felis don't help each other; quite the opposite. Many cities have wide felis networks that they use to help each other flourish.",
                "Felis share with their more cat-like cousins their love of stories, but they use them in a different way. Felis culture is shared orally, passing down their history through songs, rhymes, and parables. This cultural appreciation of song, and the way that music is treated as a way to teach history, often makes felis choose the path of the bard, becoming traveling minstrels who share felis tales and songs.",
                "They are often hired to play and sing in the drawing rooms of nobles, where their songs are seen as exotic and strange. It's said that felis presence in noble houses has given birth to a wide network of spies who share coded messages between members through their own version of thieves' cant in the form of song. Some of these felis spies allegedly even double as assassins if this secret organization requires it of them.",
                "The cultural push towards self-reliance, their love for stories, and their innate curiosity often push the felis towards a life of adventuring. Many of them believe that in doing so, they are following in the footsteps of their traveling god, and hope to cross paths with him one day."

                "Faced with this unfortunate existence, jinxes go through life in many different ways. Since many are nomadic by necessity, they take on adventuring, as it's one of the few professions that can benefit from bad luck - after all, the jinx's misfortune can just as easily affect those the jinx is fighting. Some jinxes decide to rebel against their cruel fate, and try to find a way to free themselves and their brethren from their curse in their travels, keeping a happy and positive attitude even in the face of constant misfortune, while others embrace their bad luck and form guilds that send jinxes against their targets to plague them with ill fortune.",

						"Because the jinx's trademark feature can affect other party members, it's very important that you talk not only with your GM but also with the other players before you choose to play a character of this species.",
						"I firmly believe that characters with setbacks and negative features can facilitate incredible moments while in play, but this only works when everyone accepts and is willing to play with those setbacks.",
						"There is an alternate rule that will limit the effects of the jinx's trademark feature. As the system is written, bad luck affects anyone around the jinx somewhat evenly: sometimes the jinx, sometimes their party members, and sometimes NPCs and enemies. Instead, you can choose to only allow yourself and NPCs to be affected by the bad luck, not the other player characters. This means that more unlucky events will be directed at you, but it is a compromise you may be interested in making if your fellow players don't want to use the rules of the jinx's features."

				"Verdant orcs are orcs intrinsically con- nected to their original creator deity. When he was sundered, the Orc Father lost his essence, turning him into a god-like monster, but part of his original self keeps fighting within the monster, and this is the part that reached out to his children and created verdant orcs.",
				"Verdant orcs are what orcs were meant to be at their creation. They have an intrinsic connection not only to their creator, but also to nature. They retain the green tint to their skin that gives them their name, but their connection to nature is not just skin deep. Verdant orcs can literally sustain themselves through photosynthesis like a plant, and their connection to their creator god allows them to be creators themselves, excelling in all tasks that require equal knowledge and control of nature and civilization, such as farming or woodworking.",
                "To assume their natural connection or their crafting abilities makes verdant orcs less fearsome warriors than their other orcish siblings would be a mistake, as they retain the powerful bodies characteristic of the orc species. Verdant orcs excel at combat, both in all-out brawls and covert ambushes in their forests. Their connection to their divine Father enhances their resilience, allowing them to gain a surge of energy when pushed to the brink of death.",
                "Verdant orc communities tend to live in the forest, where they thrive, but many leave these bastions of nature. Some do so for personal reasons, but many others go on a quest larger than themselves. Many verdant orcs believe that their Father can be saved and restored to his former self, and it falls to them, those who have received the blessing that was once afforded to all orcs, to save their creator."

				"Reports of the creation of an un-familiar are few and far between, but they are all marked by tragedy. The precise process to create an un-familiar is not known, but arcanists have gleaned common links between the different instances of un-familiars being born. Many un-familiars seem to be born at the time of familiar summoning. Interruption of the casting ritual, faulty or corrupted materials being used in the casting process, or even interference by an arcanist with ill intent during the familiar summoning have been known to create an un-familiar.",
				"More upsettingly, mistreatment or neglect of a familiar by its master has also been known to cause the birth of an un-familiar. Wizards who leave their familiar in its pocket dimension for inordinately long periods of time have reported summoning an un-familiar instead of their familiar when they finally decide to call it back, to nefarious consequences. There's even a well-known case of a Warlock repeatedly ordering their familiar to perform tasks the familiar did not approve of. The familiar gradually lost control of its form until it finally formed into an un-familiar.",
				"Whatever the reason behind their creation, un-familiars are extremely dangerous aberrations. Their form is more arcane than physical, their body almost entirely composed of raw magic. The un-familiar's form is therefore ever-changing, manifesting body parts of different animals in the blink of an eye according to its needs. An un-familiar can sprout wings to fly high one second and then plunge into a body of water and swim with its new-formed fins the next, making it extremely hard to pin down. This roiling arcane energy at the heart of the un-familiar's form also allows it to cast spells, but the chaotic nature of its existence makes it unable to control this magic, slingling spells its master once knew at its enemies and, most commonly, at its former master.",
				"Un-familiars seem to have a searing hatred for arcane spellcasters—and, more particularly, their former masters, or any caster with their own familiar. Spellcasters that have faced an un-familiar along with their own familiar report theirs being particularly shaken by the experience, with some witnessing the summoned spirit struggle to maintain its form after seeing the un-familiar. If the un-familiar condition is somehow contagious amongst familiars, this makes them an even more terrifying foe than was previously thought."

				"Hags are known to feed on suffering, although there are stories of hags that feed on other emotions, like ambition, or fear—but they are not the only fey beings that feed on emotions. Chest weasels feed on frustration.",
				"These fey beings derive sustenance from annoying those around them, and they do so through their ability to possess objects and bend them to their will. A chest weasel will inhabit any object it thinks it can use to create delectable frustration. When they are young, many chest weasels live in cities, possessing small objects like stones in a cobblestone street, which they raise as people walk by to trip them. When chest weasels reach maturity, they develop a taste for a more sophisticated frustration, which is where they get their name.",
				"Chest weasels find that adventurers going through deadly dungeons have very low tolerance for any sort of shenanigans, which means that frustration is bubbling right below the surface, and they just need a push for it to come spewing out. The weasels possess chests, or other containers that an adventurer might look into in search of treasure, and make it their mission to annoy them as much as possible.",
				"They make a lockbox incorporeal, or shift the position of a jar so that adventurers are unable to actually inspect it, or make it so that a chest produces another chest when opened, feasting all the while on the adventurers' irritation.",
				"But despite what their behavior might lead you to believe, chest weasels are not inherently evil, and many understand that their source of food is not a pleasant experience for those who supply it. If properly satiated, a chest weasel will pop out of its container and thank the adventurer who has fed it, either by giving them whatever was hidden away in its container, or by helping the adventurer in their trek through the dungeon.",
				"There are even stories of chest weasels striking deals with magic shop owners, or becoming shop owners themselves, so that they may better cater to those they plan on feeding from later."

				"A mind's eye is what happens when an aberration that believes itself to be perfect becomes aware of its flaws. The circumstances that trigger this realization don't matter; once the seed of doubt is planted in the aberration's mind, they spiral into a deep pit of self-doubt. What pulls them out of that pit is a new motivation: to be perfect.",
				"The mind's eye must be as perfect as they see themselves to be. It's this impossible drive that allows them to unlock an ability that all the aberrations the mind's eye is derived from have, quite literally, dormant within themselves: their ability to warp reality.",
				"This specific original aberration is only able to achieve this within dreams, and has no control over it, whereas a mind's eye can do this at will, and so they continually transform themselves and their surroundings in their quest towards perfection. Over the course of their process to become perfect, a mind's eye becomes almost unrecognizable as their original self. They keep their central eye and the eyes on their eyestalks, but their flesh is changed into perfect, polished metal. They get rid of any biological matter, becoming fully artificial, unaging.",
				"However, the process never ends. The mind's eye is aware that they aren't perfect, but their egotistical nature doesn't allow them to understand that they never will be. They constantly change themselves and, soon enough, they turn their eyes outwards as well as inwards. They realize their lair is not perfect, nor are their minions, and they go about changing them, too, using the same reality-warping power that they used to change themselves. Mind's eyes are often referred to as “Architects” because of the magnificent lairs they build in their never-ending quest for perfection."

				"Shubeiks and lubeiks are genies that are born out of a soul melding with the cosmic energies of good or evil rather than with the primal energies of the elements, and this dichotomy makes them both similar to and polar opposites of one another.",
				"Unlike most genies, both shubeiks and lubeiks spend most of their time on the Material Plane, as that is where they believe they can carry out their work most effectively.",
				"Shubeiks, genies of good, only grant wishes to evil people. They seek out the greediest, most violent, most selfish mortals and put themselves in their service. The trick is that shubeiks are more likely than any other genie to twist the wording of a wish against the wisher. Shubeiks will take the wishes of their evil masters and twist them to generate more good in the world, showing their masters that they can make the people and the world around them better. They do this in the hope of changing their masters' minds so that, in time, the person might forgo their evil ways—and perhaps even join them in death as a new shubeik.",
				"Shubeiks might be the embodiment of good, but they are not naive. If the person they are accompanying fails to see the error of their ways after receiving the help of a shubeik, the genie will turn against their “master,” angered by their dogged refusal to become a better person.",
				"Lubeiks, genies of evil, grant poisoned wishes to good people. Much like shubeiks, they'll attach themselves to a mortal, but they'll choose those who possess truly kind souls, and then they'll wait for their target to slip up. For them to have an unkind thought, a selfish thought. And then they make that thought a wish, and that wish a reality. Every mortal, no matter how kind, selfless, or gentle, has felt envy, or wished ill on someone they despise, and a lubeik will wait in the darkness for those thoughts to bubble up to the surface. They try to steer a good soul towards evil and, hopefully upon their death, give rise to a new lubeik.",
				"The reason why these two kinds of genies seek to corrupt or purify the souls of mortals is that they are locked in an eternal war of attrition, desperately trying to increase their numbers and decrease the numbers of their enemy. Souls that started as the worst of society and then found the error of their ways—or, conversely, started as kind and noble but were corrupted in life—are the souls that give rise to noble shubeiks and noble lubeiks, the most powerful of these genies, and the most important soldiers in their never-ending war."
