				"This spell takes a creature and pushes its body backwards in time to a point at which it was in better health. This simulates a healing ability without using clerical powers. Time is of the essence when using this spell, though, as the farther into the past the body is pushed, the higher the chance of failure. The caster can push the body back one round in time for every level the spell is cast at. For example, a 9th-level casting of this spell is guaranteed to restore a person back to the state of health they were in nine rounds ago. For every additional round that the caster attempts to push the body backward in time, there is a cumulative 10% chance of failure. If the 9th-level spell slot were used this spell to heal a warrior wounded just over 14 rounds before the spell was cast, that would be 5 rounds further than the caster could guarantee success, so the spell would have a 50% chance of failing.",
				"Time Heal cannot recall a spirit from death and therefore is only useful on a still-living character. A dead body that has Time Heal cast on it may be entirely healed, but it remains dead, as the body's spirit has fled. If the spirit can somehow be reunited with the body (say through raise dead), the patient will then be alive and as well as the time heal can make them. Time Heal can also be used to hurt an opponent that has just healed itself. In this case, the caster must successfully touch the target, and the target gets to make a constitution saving throw vs your spell DC. Any healing (or damage) done to the target is reverted to an earlier state. The standard chances of failure still apply."
