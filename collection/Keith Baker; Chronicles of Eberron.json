					"The default lich in the {@book Monster Manual|MM} is presented as an arcane spellcaster, but there is certainly a divine path to lichdom. The people of the north know about Lady Illmarrow, but the Brelish tell stories of Gath. In life, Hogar Gath was the high priest of the Sovereign Host, infamous for his love of luxuries. After his death, it was revealed that Gath had also been leading a cult of the Keeper in lower Sharn ... and that he was still leading it. Champions of the Silver Flame rallied and destroyed the undead priest. But even after his defeat, thieves who sought to pillage his \"mausoleum\"--effectively a mansion he'd built in Sharn's City of the Dead--rarely returned. Typically this was attributed to the deadly wards and traps, the finest and most expensive House Kundarak could provide. But stories began to circulate that Gath himself had risen again and still dwelled in the mausoleum ... and so he had.",
					"This pattern continued for centuries. Once, he was revealed to be behind a new criminal organization that was challenging the Boromar Clan. Another time, he was exposed as the force behind a smuggling ring being run out of the Pavilion of the Host itself. Sometimes he's destroyed, sometimes he flees; whatever happens, he always returns eventually.",
					"The typical lich must be a master of arcane science, and most are consumed by their obsession with eldritch knowledge. Divine liches are rarer and more unique. Gath didn't become a lich by accident. He prepared for it, which is one reason his mausoleum was so richly appointed and heavily secured. And those preparations required him to perform sacrifices that were both horrific and expensive. His love of luxuries is just a surface manifestation of his absolute and relentless greed, which is ultimately what makes him such an effective servant of the Keeper. Where the arcane lich is sustained by will, in many ways Gath is sustained by sheer greed--by the desire to expand his hoard, to have the finest things. In many ways, he's more akin to the stereotypical fantasy dragon than is any dragon of Argonnessen. Gath doesn't care about conquest and has no inherent desire to kill others: but he'll do anything to satisfy his greed, and he'll never be satisfied with what he has.",
					"Gath also continues to serve as a Talon of the Keeper, training new priests and serving as an intermediary for those who would bargain with the Sovereign of Death and Decay. Adventurers could be surprised to find that the mysterious patron who funded their expedition now wants them to deliver the treasure they recovered to the City of the Dead. He's absolutely evil, but his schemes are always driven by greed and might not actually pose a threat to the world at large ... and as a bonus, he pays his agents very well."

I'm telling you now, you get too close to the Sunless Isle and pirates are the least of your worries. I know you've heard these stories before, but have you ever wondered where the Bloodsails got these bones so they could animate 'em? I can tell you in two words: Haeldar Krakensbane.",
									"That elf was a legend in life, a dragonslayer who fought alongside the rebel elves just for a chance to fight dragons. So he gets himself exiled for his troubles, and sails north with the rest of 'em. His ship runs afoul of a bloody great kraken, which demands tribute from the fleet. The elves, they're rightly terrified, and they all agree to pay its price. But Haeldar, he's not having it. It's his ancestor, see? Never would bend to a beast. So he seizes control of his ship, and no surprise, kraken sinks it and kills everyone aboard--including Haeldar's children! You'd think that would be the end of it, but weeks later, as them elves are camped out on the sunless shore, they see a monster on the horizon. It's the kraken; after it swallowed Haeldar, he refused to die, dug his way up through its heart and out its eye. Now here he is, riding the damn dead thing home. ",
									"That beast still patrols the waters of Farlnen today. And Haeldar ... well, he spends much of his time mourning his lost children, but when the mood is upon him, he goes back to sea. He won't force his own on the hunt, not again--so he boards a stranger's vessel, assumes command, and takes it on another monster hunt. If he comes to your ship, hope you're one of the lucky ones, that he takes down his prey with your vessel still intact. Haeldar Krakensbane never misses his mark ... but the ships he sails rarely make it home again."

							"In life, Haeldar Arrael was a Tairnadal of the Draleus Tairn. He fought alongside the line of Vol not because he believed in their cause, but because it gave him the opportunity to fight dragons. Over the course of the conflict, he fell in love with an elf of the Vyrael line, and following the defeat of the line of Vol, he sailed north in the company of his wife and kin. As the story says, when a mighty leviathan threatened his ship, Haeldar put his dreams of glory ahead of the safety of his family. He lost everything, including his own life--but his hunger for victory was so great that he returned as a death knight in the very belly of the kraken, slaying his enemy and animating its corpse.",

He's always searching for a greater, grander challenge, something to overshadow his pain. He's the source of many of the great beasts bound in undeath as guardians of Farlnen. Haeldar slays these creatures--serpents, dragon turtles, and his eponymous kraken--personally, and his unique gift animates those he slays; however, he turns control of these sentinels over to living necromancers upon his return to the island. And as the tale says, when he's in the mood for a hunt, Haeldar sets out on board a Bloodsail vessel--but he then boards and seizes control of some other ship, ensuring he doesn't place more elves at risk in his relentless pursuit of challenges at sea."

All mortals of Eberron possess a connection to Dal Quor, glimpsing the realm of dreams when they sleep. But among the manifest zones of these depths, unique creatures evolved with a far deeper connection--existing in both realms simultaneously, they perceived both the dreamscape and the Material Plane at all times. They called themselves the Quor-Toa, the People of Dreams. Beyond their power to perceive Dal Quor, the Quor-Toa could draw the essence of Dal Quor into reality and shape it within the manifest zones below the Barren Sea, sculpting tools, structures, and servants from the stuff of dreams. Their deep empire was a place of impossible wonders, of spectacles dragons and giants could only dream of.

In the end, the giants destroyed the Quor-Toa without even meaning to. Forty thousand years ago, the giants severed the ties between Eberron and Dal Quor, as a way to end their conflict with the quori ... and in the process, they destroyed the Quor-Toa. As the manifest zones tied to Dal Quor were stripped of power, the dream-towers of the Quor-Toa melted away, the fishfolk suffered devastating psychic trauma, and their civilization collapsed into chaos. Though later generations adjusted to this shattered connection, their people were never the same. Their knowledge had been stored in libraries of dreams, vaults that were shattered and lost, and their psychic gifts were twisted.

An individual shaper's abilities are just a shadow of the power they wield as a community, as discussed below.",

Because Dal Quor is currently shaped by il-Lashtavar--the Darkness that Dreams--a kuo-toa's dreamscape is often one of nightmares, and this in turn shapes the way they interact with the world. Adventurers might meet a kuo-toa who has learned to resist this; perhaps one of the dreamseers has even touched il-Yannah and can channel positive dreams. However, as long as the kuo-toa remain linked to the Darkness that Dreams, their dreamscape will continue to attract nightmares."

					"The upper waters of the Barren Sea are deadly, but descend far enough and the salinity of the water drops. It is here that adventurers can discover the \"sinister fiends that dwell in horrid cities far below the waves\" mentioned in the Eberron Campaign Guide. Those creatures that dwell on the ocean floor aren't literal fiends, but their realm is a terrifying array of nightmares--and their gods are sinister indeed. This is the domain of the kuo-toa.",
					"While the upper waters of the Barren Sea are close to Mabar and Risia, the depths of the ocean once held powerful manifest zones tied to Dal Quor, the Region of Dreams. All mortals of Eberron possess a connection to Dal Quor, glimpsing the realm of dreams when they sleep. But among the manifest zones of these depths, unique creatures evolved with a far deeper connection--existing in both realms simultaneously, they perceived both the dreamscape and the Material Plane at all times. They called themselves the Quor-Toa, the People of Dreams. Beyond their power to perceive Dal Quor, the Quor-Toa could draw the essence of Dal Quor into reality and shape it within the manifest zones below the Barren Sea, sculpting tools, structures, and servants from the stuff of dreams. Their deep empire was a place of impossible wonders, of spectacles dragons and giants could only dream of. Yet because they could only work these wonders in manifest zones to Dal Quor, the Quor-Toa never sought to spread into other lands or seas.",
					"Though uninterested in expansion, they defended their territory--and as a result, few giant explorers ever reached Sarlona, though some Cul'sir records describe the glories glimpsed below the waves of the \"Golden Sea\" and the godlike beings that defended it. In the end, the giants destroyed the Quor-Toa without even meaning to. Forty thousand years ago, the giants severed the ties between Eberron and Dal Quor, as a way to end their conflict with the quori ... and in the process, they destroyed the Quor-Toa. As the manifest zones tied to Dal Quor were stripped of power, the dream-towers of the Quor-Toa melted away, the fishfolk suffered devastating psychic trauma, and their civilization collapsed into chaos. Though later generations adjusted to this shattered connection, their people were never the same. Their knowledge had been stored in libraries of dreams, vaults that were shattered and lost, and their psychic gifts were twisted. They no longer called themselves the Quor-Toa, the People of Dreams--they had become kuo-toa, the fallen people.",

Such a seer might manifest true seeing--seeing a shapeshifter's true form as a dream aura around it--or other divination effects. Meanwhile, kuo-toa shapers can cast illusion or conjuration spells by pulling dreams into reality, often without fully understanding that this is what they're doing. An individual shaper's abilities are just a shadow of the power they wield as a community, as discussed below.",
							"Beyond their innate powers, there's a second aspect that's crucial to understanding the kuo-toa's dual experience of Dal Quor and Eberron. Because Dal Quor is currently shaped by il-Lashtavar--the Darkness that Dreams--a kuo-toa's dreamscape is often one of nightmares, and this in turn shapes the way they interact with the world. Adventurers might meet a kuo-toa who has learned to resist this; perhaps one of the dreamseers has even touched il-Yannah and can channel positive dreams. However, as long as the kuo-toa remain linked to the Darkness that Dreams, their dreamscape will continue to attract nightmares."

But a land with no sun sounds mighty nice if you're a vampire, like Lord Varonaen! So he steers the elves to Farlnen, and when he gets there, he breaks his ship to splin-ters and he scatters the splinters across the stony ground. He kills his own sailors and waters the wood with their blood, and they sprout up as darkwood trees and bloodstained roses. All the night-gardens of Farlnen, it was Varonaen who planted their seeds. And if the Bloodsails kill you on the sea? They'll keep your bones to work an oar, but they won't let your flesh go to waste; cargoes of carrion make their way to Farlnen to feed the bloody gardens."

Varonaen was fascinated by those strains of flora that managed to adapt to Aerenal's Mabaran zones, and he improved on these with his own hybrids; in fact, it was he who refined the strain of darkwood that Aerenal exports to this day.",

The story quoted above is apocryphal, but it holds seeds of truth. Varonaen brought his hybrids with him across the Lhazaar Sea and established the first night gardens. He planted darkwood groves, and in the centuries that followed, he developed entirely new strains of vegeta-tion that could thrive in the unique conditions of Farlnen. The stories exaggerate when they say darkwood is watered with blood, but some of Varonaen's creations do thrive when fertilized with the flesh of the dead. Some of his experiments are just plants, but others could be considered both Plants and Undead; Varonaen has created assassin vines that drain the lifeforce of creatures they constrict, and a shrieker that howls with the cry of a banshee.

He has the manner of a mild, friendly scholar--but he feels no compunctions about creating plant life that feeds on the living, nor about sacrificing strangers in this work."

Nonetheless, a story could involve fighting Mordain, and statistics are provided for him here ... but {@i defeating} Mordain and {@i killing} him are two very different tasks.",
							"One of Mordain's defining features is that he's impossible to kill. The Twelve took him prisoner, but even with all of the resources at their disposal, they couldn't kill him. Think of it this way: through his work, Mordain has essentially become a living artifact, and is as indestructible as any other artifact--including being immune to the effects of a {@item sphere of annihilation}! So if the adventurers have to kill Mordain, what can they do that the Twelve couldn't have tried back in the day? Could adventurers gain the power to kill him by dealing with Katashka the Gatekeeper or the Bone King of Mabar? Is there some secret tied to his past that would reveal a weakness-- could he be killed by a member of his own bloodline, or by one of his own creations? Like an artifact, there's surely some way to destroy Mordain, but learning this technique and executing it would be an epic challenge."

Long ago, Mordain created skinweavers--spider-like aberrations that weave webs from the muscles and entrails of their victims. The forest is filled with a bizarre array of flora and fauna, ranging from eerie natural things from other environments (like phosphorescent vegetation usually only found underground) to Mordain's entirely unnatural creations. Adventurers could encounter a troll with the wings and Luring Song of a harpy, or a manti-core with the massive head of a medusa--and its deadly abilities. Like the skinweavers, some of these creations have carved out a broad niche within the region, but for the most part, the Forest of Flesh is filled with bizarre and unique encounters."

This gruesome structure is unnaturally durable. Its walls are as strong as steel, and it swiftly regenerates damage. It's impossible to teleport through the walls of Blackroot, and divination magic can't penetrate its walls.",
							"Seen from afar, Blackroot is an imposing structure, but it's even larger on the inside; there are several extradi-mensional spaces within the tower, similar to magnificent mansions. Explorers may pass through a door to what should be a small room and instead find themselves in an immense storeroom or a vast menagerie filled with crea-tures Mordain has created and abandoned.",
							"It's possible that Mordain has evolved beyond his humanoid form and that he essentially is Blackroot. If this is the case, he has some degree of awareness spread across the tower--though just as most humans don't know exactly what's going on within their bodies at all times, it would take something significant to draw his attention."

									"Mummies are produced by rituals that include embalming and mummification (among many other factors); this leads to their commonly used name. But that's just a cosmetic detail, and not what most necromancers consider to be their defining principle. Most necromancers call these undead \"oathbound.\" Anyone can become oathbound; the process requires a conduit to Mabar, an expert necromancer, a series of rituals including the embalming process, and rare and expensive components. But there's one more essential aspect of creating a mummy: its oaths. These conditions and parameters are integral to creating oathbound. And once created, the mummy must obey these oaths, as they're used to bind its essence to its body and prevent it from being dragged to Dolurrh.",
									"This is how you end up with a mummy bound to protect a specific tomb. Even if it's intelligent, the mummy can't choose to leave the tomb and forget about it; that role of \"tomb guardian\" is what defines it and preserves it. Most mummies are bound by restrictive oaths; for example, many Bloodsail mummies are bound to their ships. The looser these oaths, the more power and components are required for the ritual. Malevanor, the high priest of Atur, has far fewer restrictions than most oathbound; but he was created by the finest Seeker necromancer of the time, at great cost. Of liches, vampires, and oathbound, the oathbound are the most common form of undead within the Blood of Vol. Their mummies are often bound to temples or villages, but many of the oathbound are never seen. There are hundreds of mummies in Atur, but most dwell in the vaults and temples of the City of Night, tirelessly performing their duties."

									"The mummy in the {@book Monster Manual||MM} only reflects one type of oathbound, the classic tomb guardian. Such a creature was typically made into a mummy as a sort of curse, forced by its oaths to battle intruders; it's a physical powerhouse, but it hasn't tried to retain its mortal consciousness, and it certainly wouldn't make a great research assistant.",
									"However, there is great diversity among oathbound; despite all being sustained by the same basic rituals and power, they typically retain their mental ability scores, their proficiencies, and some of their abilities. For example, Malevanor is the high priest of Atur and can perform divine magic. Meanwhile, the oathbound Seeker stat block presented here represents a devoted martyr of the Blood of Vol, bound by its oaths to protect and teach a particular community of Seekers.",
									"In creating an oathbound, consider what oaths bind it. What are the restrictions on its actions and choices? Who was it in life, and what key skills has it retained in its undeath? Has it retained its sense of mercy and empathy, or has this been worn away?",
									"Keep in mind that an oathbound can't intentionally violate its oaths. If it's somehow forced to do so, it must do everything in its power to rectify the situation immediately. If it can't, this will weaken the bonds that sustain its existence; within a period of hours or days, the mummy eventually disintegrates. However, there could always be exceptions if it suits the story! A mummy with the strength of will to break its oath might become something else--finding a new way to sustain itself--potentially transforming into something like a death knight or a wight, depending on the power of the spirit and its personal story."

This is why the touch of the mummy causes flesh to rot and why its gaze causes dread; it's a vessel for Mabar, which embodies the death of all that lives and the end of all hope. While oathbound aren't affected as dramatically as vampires are, the influence of Mabar still erodes their compassion and empathy; consequently, most mummies have an evil alignment.",
									"As is always the case in Eberron, oathbound can have an evil alignment and still be driven to do good--but because of that lack of empathy, they may do good deeds in an evil way. A mummy forgets pain, and so it doesn't care about causing pain to others; as a result, mummies tend to be crueler than the deathless of Aerenal, who are sustained by positive energy. You can have a good or neutral mummy, but there's a reason they are rare. And even for these, the Aereni point to the mummy's Rotting Touch to support their assertion that the oathbound do consume the life force of the world--that even though mummies don't actively feed on others as vampires do, they are still slowly destroying the world merely by existing."

If the myths are true, it's here that the Progenitors laid the cornerstone of creation. The Undying Court seeks to follow in their footsteps--to create a new reality.

At the monastery's center lies a council chamber where the ascendant councilors commune with one another and exert their power. While the most important inhabitants of Var-Tolai are the astral forms of the ascendant councilors, there is a population of mortal elves--scholars, priests, and soldiers--who are physically present. The Var-Tolai priest stat block in this section provides statistics for some of the elves who live and labor here on the Astral Plane.",

This realm is very much a work in progress, fluid and unsustainable. But they are continuing to work at it. When adventurers visit, the realm on the other side of the gate could be a tiny island or a vast continent. It could be a perfect replica of Aerenal, or it could be a wondrous realm that defies the laws of physics.
