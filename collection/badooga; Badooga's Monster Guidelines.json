In tandem with the official books, this document will show you how to make monsters, insert them into an encounter, and determine their behavior during combat. The appendix contains premade stat blocks and other monster content that you can use with minimal preparation or effort.",

After reading Chapter 1 (three pages), I would recommend jumping to a specific section that catches your eye using the table of contents below, or to skim through the document until you find something you're interested in. However you end up reading this document, I hope you get some good use out of it.",

Rules regarding the Challenge Rating system are given in the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|dmg}.",

							"name": "What does it do right?",

								"In short, the Challenge Rating system, when used by someone aware of its limitations, can be used to create monsters that are both properly balanced and fun to fight. By knowing the factors that influence CR, using the given charts to estimate what stats any monster should have at a certain CR, and by manipulating the numeric difference between a monster's Offensive Challenge Rating (OCR) and Defensive Challenge Rating (DCR), a DM can make monsters of all shapes and sizes. As an added bonus, the system's abstract nature leaves plenty of room for the DM to add extra abilities (e.g. imposing conditions or diseases) without imbalancing the monster too much."
							]
						},
						{
							"type": "entries",
							"name": "What does it do wrong?",
							"entries": [
								"The encounter creation guidelines in the DMG fail to properly account for the \"action economy\", which refers to the number of discrete actions that can be taken by each side of the encounter. For example, a creature with Legendary Actions is much more capable of taking on a party by itself than a creature without such actions, even if the two are balanced to be at the same CR.",
								"Additionally, Challenge Rating is a one-size fits all rating system, but not all monsters are the same. Should I give a monster exactly the amount of hit points given on the table in the DMG? How should I weigh a \"tank\" monster's OCR versus its DCR? What about for a sneaky rogue-esque monster? And what about my custom boss fight?",
								"As it turns out, the system provides most of the tools needed to rectify these problems. However, it does not adequately explain how to use such tools. While monster homebrewers can master the craft of monster design given enough practice, inexperienced creators will have trouble creating a properly designed monster given the supposedly balanced nature of the system, and might be (rightfully) upset that the official books don't give them any good advice on the matter."

Many controllers even use their powers to directly disable their opponents by charming, incapacitating, or restraining them. Such powers can take the form of magical or psionic abilities activated from a distance, or they can be delivered in melee via auras or on top of melee attacks. {@creature harpy|mm|Harpies}, {@creature mind flayer|mm|mind flayers}, and {@creature rakshasa|mm|rakshasas} are all examples of controllers.",

While I recommend reading it for yourself, I will summarize most of the differences here:",

										"A lot of this stuff is certainly interesting and should exist in 5e in some capacity. But there are a lot of issues surrounding {@b compatibility}. While there is a conversion chart that allows you to convert back and forth between CR and ML, the differences in design and such make it difficult to use official monsters alongside this system. In other words, it makes it much harder to use official monsters and campaign modules using this system, although I can imagine it isn't impossible for someone experienced with it.",
										"That said, not everyone is {@b experienced} with monster homebrew and D&D in general. While this system's freeform nature allows for some creative applications, it also means that a new DM might be more confused than if they were to stick with the official monsters and monster math provided in the core books. After all, monsters in 5e are spelled out they way they are so that they can be used in play with minimal editing and work on the part of the DM. This is contrasted to GiffyGlyph's system, which is more geared towards those already comfortable with the system and willing to put more work into their monsters.",
										"Finally, this system has issues with {@b modularity}, and is mostly designed to be used as a complete package. Suppose you like the freeform attacks, but end up not liking the core math or the templates for each monster role. This gives you two choices: either use this system despite this, or rebuild the feature from scratch in base 5e.",
										"Personally, I like a lot of GiffyGlyph's ideas, but I am a fan of Challenge Rating and the general math behind official monsters. So, I took the second option for you by taking a lot of his ideas and inserting them into this document. I also kept modularity in mind when making this - perhaps you are only here for the encounter balancing rules, or maybe you only care about the boss fight variants presented later on. Some of you might only care about the stat blocks presented in the appendix. No matter why you're here, this document is designed to be compatible with base 5e, to present content for inexperienced and experienced DMs alike, and to allow you to pick and choose what you want to use from it."

Lair actions are special powers that certain monsters can use to manipulate the lair they reside in. For example, an ancient red dragon can cause magma and volcanic gases to erupt within its lair, while Orcus can cause corpses within the lair to animate as undead. Not only do these powers add to the presentation of the fight, but they also influence the action economy by allowing a monster that has them to do more from round to round.",
										"That said, just like legendary actions (see below), lair actions needn't be restricted to boss fights, high CR monsters, or even to lairs in general. For example, the lair action system can be used to quantify the spread of fire due to a rampaging squad of rogue fire elementals, which lacks all three of these qualities. In other cases, you can even just have environmental shifts (e.g. the effects of a natural earthquake) occur on initiative count 20 of each round, which is the equivalent of a lair action that isn't even taken by a monster at all.",
										"The \"lair actions without a lair\" concept might sound strange at first, but can actually be used quite well in boss fights and other climactic scenarios. Many official monsters have lair actions that don't necessarily manipulate their lair itself; for example, both of {@creature Zariel|mtf}'s lair actions boil down to her casting some sort of spell. While the lack of a lair dependency is arguably a form of bad design (an argument I won't disagree with), this independence also allows you to use these lair actions even when it is outside of its lair or it doesn't have a lair in the first place. Remember that while this might work for some monsters, it might not work with the ones that directly manipulate their lair via their lair actions.",

For example, many creatures often have a legendary action that lets them move, which can be used to reposition, to retreat when in a bad situation, or to give chase when in a good situation.

										"Some of the {@b finer details} are also important to remember:",
										{
											"type": "list",

												"Even if there is more than one AO monster on the field, one villain action being used per round is enough. The monsters can share villain actions, or you can pick and choose (or just write out from the start) which monster gets to use their villain action each round.",
												"Adhering to traditional game mechanics is fine, but the point of this free-form system is to allow for abilities to exist without having to justify them beyond \"because it's cool\". Monsters shouldn't have the same limitations as PCs do, so they should be able to do whatever the DM wants them to (unless it is unfair or doesn't make any sense)."
											]
										},
										"What {@b lessons} can we learn from this and apply to our general knowledge of official monster making rules? Let's see:",
										{
											"type": "list",
											"items": [
												"Game mechanics are ultimately the vehicle through which the narrative is delivered. Don't let the rules of the system hold you back from creating powers that are cool and exciting (unless they are unfair to your players, of course). Monsters aren't built like player characters are, so they don't have to follow the same rules to determine what powers they get and how much they can use them. The only limit here is how you choose to design the monster.",
												"In order to engage your players with an important monster, the monster can't be static in its actions. By creating a diverse set of monster abilities where there isn't an option that is objectively the best to use throughout the majority of the fight, you have an encounter whose pacing, excitement, and dramatic tension is much better than that a static encounter.",
												"If there is more than one legendary monster on the field, you might want to condense their legendary action options into one pool of legendary actions to track. These abilities should be more powerful than a single monster's legendary actions, as they represent the firepower of multiple monsters at once. For an official example of this, see the Obzedat Ghost stat block (GGR 245). The same idea applies to lair actions: if two legendary monsters share a lair, it might be wise to use one list of (possibly empowered) lair actions."
											]
										},
										"AO monsters seem pretty cool. That, are there any {@b flaws} to this approach?",
										{
											"type": "list",
											"items": [
												"If you make AO monsters for yourself, that sounds pretty great. However, if you make monsters to be published/used by others, using a homebrew approach to monster making might be incompatible with many DMs's games. This applies to all homebrew monster creation methods, it applies here in particular because if you are publishing your monsters publically, you can accomplish much of what Colville sought to do with this method via the use of pre-existing game mechanics.",
												"AO monsters are designed with the goal of being dynamic, but the way they are set up might just encourage the opposite. While villain actions are like regular lair actions in that they can be used after a specific player's turn, the scripted order in which they are used makes it harder for a monster to adapt to a given situation. For example, the AO Goblin Boss's \"Focus Fire\" villain action, which allows the Boss's goblin minions to immediately move towards one creature of the Boss's choice, might not make sense to use when the current fight involves sniping the party from range and then immediately using Nimble Escape to hide again. Yet, the Goblin Boss is forced to either use the ability anyway, which is a suboptimal tactical decision, or to not to use the ability at all, which makes the whole system pointless. With legendary actions, there will always be some option that can be used by the monster in any given situation.",
												"Building off of the previous point, villain actions only being usable once per round can sometimes be less exciting and fast-paced than being able to use multiple legendary actions per round. While the individual legendary actions might not be as strong, being able to actually respond to the party's actions multiple times per round (beyond the monster's reaction) can make a solo fight much more challenging than. Besides, you can always make some options cost two or three legendary actions; a legendary action that costs three actions is literally a villain action without the flaws described here."
											]
										},
										"As you can see, all of these criticisms are directed towards the \"villain action\" system, which is the only actual part of Colville's video that deviates from the existing 5e system. Thus, I will summarize my {@b adjusted version} of this system into the following advice:",
										{
											"type": "list",
											"items": [
												"On its turn, a boss monster should have access to both utility-based and damage-based abilities. For example, you can give it the traditional option to Multiattack as an action, and then to reposition one of its allies as a bonus action. Even if the monster is a striker, if all it can do is deal damage, then the monster will probably be boring unless great care is taken in making the monster fun and exciting.",
												"Outside of its turn, a boss monster should be able to respond to the party's behavior through the use of extra abilities. Such abilities often take the form of reactions (directly responding to a trigger) and legendary actions (using an ability after a party member ends its turn), but variants of these abilities can work too if done right.",
												"To make a boss monster cool, it shouldn't be using the same abilities over and over again. Whether through a diverse pool of legendary actions or a sequence of scripted events, using different abilities as the rounds go on maintains the excitement and tension over the course of the fight."

										"The concept of action economy is discussed earlier in this document. In encounter building, the action economy should be balanced as to not allow any side to be overwhelmingly superior to the the other, which creates one-sided stomps that might be inconsistent with the intended difficulty of the encounter.",
										"As a rule of thumb, {@b the monsters should never be inferior to the party in action economy}. For example, a monster with only three legendary actions (four effective actions total) can easily be dunked on by a party of five or more players, unless the monster is capable of targeting multiple characters with the majority of its abilities. When not dealing with legendary actions, this means that you should always have at least one monster for every player in the party.",
										"It should be noted that some player characters might be capable of making more attacks than others on a given turn. The number of attacks a character can make per turn adds to its action economy, but other players will be just as effective. For example, a fighter with two attacks can be just as effective as a rogue with one attack, as the rogue deals extra damage via the Sneak Attack feature. Thus, while the number of possible player attacks shouldn't be ignored, it typically won't influence how difficult you should make an encounter.",
										"The exception to this is when players, such as spellcasters, have access to abilities that have a large area of effect. For example, if the wizard of the party has the {@spell fireball} spell, that group will be able to take down a mob of skeletons very easily. Without the {@spell fireball} spell, the encounter might be a bit more challenging for the group, even if the party is otherwise identical. As such, area of effect powers are an essential balancing factor when creating an encounter.",
										"Conversely, monsters that are more powerful tend to have multiple attacks at their disposal per round, while weaker monsters have less attacks and do less damage. This is mostly accounted for in their Challenge Rating, so as with players, it typically won't influence how difficult an encounter is unless you use a monster with access to numerous attacks per round or a monster that can use a powerful area of effect ability that can easily more than two players at once (as area of effect abilities are assumed to hit two players for the purposes of Challenge Rating).",
										"With this in mind, minion-tier monsters tend to have very weak attacks that most characters can withstand easily. As such, {@b a minion's action is worth less than that of a stronger monster}, which is why it is acceptable to send large groups of minions at most adventuring partys."

										"As a rule of thumb, {@b the addition of a terrain feature or a similar effect increases an encounter's difficulty by one step}, unless the feature is carefully designed to be beneficial or neutral to both sides of the fight when taken advantage of.

Additionally, running only one fight per day allows for players to dump all of their resources into the fight, allowing them to take on threats that are much stronger than the party should normally be allowed to take on.",
										"As mentioned in the DMG, most adventuring parties can handle about six to eight medium or hard encounters in a day. This is a maximum, and not necessarily a recommendation. Six to eight encounters is a good target in dungeons crawling with random patrols and rooms filled with monsters. However, during a narrative-based game, not only can this amount of encounters per day interfere with the pacing of the game, but it might not be realistic based on the circumstances of the current story.",
										"With that in mind, the DMG offers a few fixes. Instead of throwing many easier encounters at the party, you can throw a few harder encounters at them. While this is a great solution for games that wish to be very difficult, keep in mind that overusing this approach might exhaust your players over time.",
										"Another approach is to extend the length of an adventuring day. For example, in a campaign that uses normal resting rules (rather than the {@variantrule Rest Variants|dmg|Gritty Realism} variant in the DMG), you can still abstract four to seven days of travel between locations as \"one adventuring day\", where each night of rest during their travels is considered a short rest. That way, you can throw one or two  encounters at your party each in-game day without the party using all of their resources to demolish the enemy with ease. You can then switch back to normal resting when in a settlement or dungeon setting.",
										"As a rule of thumb, {@b try to have at least three combat encounters per adventuring day, with two short rests spliced between them}. Having enough encounters to warrant two short rests per adventuring day is roughly the ideal way to balance short rest and long rest classes against each other. It makes D&D a resource conservation game, as intended: while a character could potentially use a powerful daily ability in a given fight, they have to weigh the benefits of doing so against the potential detriment of not having the ability available for later use."

						"To make certain fights more epic and cool, you can give your monsters access to lair actions. Lair actions are special powers that certain monsters can use to manipulate the lair they reside in. For example, an ancient red dragon can cause magma and volcanic gases to erupt within its lair, while Orcus can cause corpses within the lair to animate as undead. Not only do these powers add to the presentation of the fight, but they also influence the action economy by allowing a monster that has them to do more from round to round.",
						"That said, just like legendary actions (see below), lair actions needn't be restricted to boss fights, high CR monsters, or even to lairs in general. For example, the lair action system can be used to quantify the spread of fire due to a rampaging squad of rogue fire elementals, which lacks all three of these qualities. In other cases, you can even just have environmental shifts (e.g. the effects of a natural earthquake) occur on initiative count 20 of each round, which is the equivalent of a lair action that isn't even taken by a monster at all.",
						"The \"lair actions without a lair\" concept might sound strange at first, but can actually be used quite well in boss fights and other climactic scenarios. Many official monsters have lair actions that don't necessarily manipulate their lair itself; for example, both of {@creature Zariel|mtf}'s lair actions boil down to her casting some sort of spell. While the lack of a lair dependency is arguably a form of bad design (an argument I won't disagree with), this independence also allows you to use these lair actions even when it is outside of its lair or it doesn't have a lair in the first place. Remember that while this might work for some monsters, it might not work with the ones that directly manipulate their lair via their lair actions.",

For example, many creatures often have a legendary action that lets them move, which can be used to reposition, to retreat when in a bad situation, or to give chase when in a good situation. The use of this legendary action must be weighed against the other options: for example, an Attack legendary action that will increase their offensive power accordingly."

For example, you might give a spellcaster the ability to Cast a Spell as a legendary action, but using this ability would cost two legendary actions at once.

								"AO monsters should have access to regular actions, bonus actions, and reactions, as well as \"villain actions\". These abilities should all be diverse and unique in nature, rather than all of them just being some sort of weapon attack.",
								"Villain actions, in Colville's words, are once-per-round legendary actions that are \"scripted\" in nature. That is, specific villain actions are set to be used on certain rounds in combat, meaning that they are scripted to be used in a certain order."
							]
						},
						"Some of the {@b finer details} are also important to remember:",
						{
							"type": "list",
							"items": [
								"Even if there is more than one AO monster on the field, one villain action being used per round is enough. The monsters can share villain actions, or you can pick and choose (or just write out from the start) which monster gets to use their villain action each round.",
								"Adhering to traditional game mechanics is fine, but the point of this free-form system is to allow for abilities to exist without having to justify them beyond \"because it's cool\". Monsters shouldn't have the same limitations as PCs do, so they should be able to do whatever the DM wants them to (unless it is unfair or doesn't make any sense)."
							]
						},
						"What {@b lessons} can we learn from this and apply to our general knowledge of official monster making rules? Let's see:",
						{
							"type": "list",
							"items": [
								"Game mechanics are ultimately the vehicle through which the narrative is delivered. Don't let the rules of the system hold you back from creating powers that are cool and exciting (unless they are unfair to your players, of course). Monsters aren't built like player characters are, so they don't have to follow the same rules to determine what powers they get and how much they can use them. The only limit here is how you choose to design the monster.",
								"In order to engage your players with an important monster, the monster can't be static in its actions. By creating a diverse set of monster abilities where there isn't an option that is objectively the best to use throughout the majority of the fight, you have an encounter whose pacing, excitement, and dramatic tension is much better than that a static encounter.",
								"If there is more than one legendary monster on the field, you might want to condense their legendary action options into one pool of legendary actions to track. These abilities should be more powerful than a single monster's legendary actions, as they represent the firepower of multiple monsters at once. For an official example of this, see the Obzedat Ghost stat block (GGR 245). The same idea applies to lair actions: if two legendary monsters share a lair, it might be wise to use one list of (possibly empowered) lair actions."
							]
						},
						"AO monsters seem pretty cool. That, are there any {@b flaws} to this approach?",
						{
							"type": "list",
							"items": [
								"If you make AO monsters for yourself, that sounds pretty great. However, if you make monsters to be published/used by others, using a homebrew approach to monster making might be incompatible with many DMs's games. This applies to all homebrew monster creation methods, it applies here in particular because if you are publishing your monsters publically, you can accomplish much of what Colville sought to do with this method via the use of pre-existing game mechanics.",
								"AO monsters are designed with the goal of being dynamic, but the way they are set up might just encourage the opposite. While villain actions are like regular lair actions in that they can be used after a specific player's turn, the scripted order in which they are used makes it harder for a monster to adapt to a given situation. For example, the AO Goblin Boss's \"Focus Fire\" villain action, which allows the Boss's goblin minions to immediately move towards one creature of the Boss's choice, might not make sense to use when the current fight involves sniping the party from range and then immediately using Nimble Escape to hide again. Yet, the Goblin Boss is forced to either use the ability anyway, which is a suboptimal tactical decision, or to not to use the ability at all, which makes the whole system pointless. With legendary actions, there will always be some option that can be used by the monster in any given situation.",
								"Building off of the previous point, villain actions only being usable once per round can sometimes be less exciting and fast-paced than being able to use multiple legendary actions per round. While the individual legendary actions might not be as strong, being able to actually respond to the party's actions multiple times per round (beyond the monster's reaction) can make a solo fight much more challenging than. Besides, you can always make some options cost two or three legendary actions; a legendary action that costs three actions is literally a villain action without the flaws described here."
							]
						},
						"As you can see, all of these criticisms are directed towards the \"villain action\" system, which is the only actual part of Colville's video that deviates from the existing 5e system. Thus, I will summarize my {@b adjusted version} of this system into the following advice:",
						{
							"type": "list",
							"items": [
								"On its turn, a boss monster should have access to both utility-based and damage-based abilities. For example, you can give it the traditional option to Multiattack as an action, and then to reposition one of its allies as a bonus action. Even if the monster is a striker, if all it can do is deal damage, then the monster will probably be boring unless great care is taken in making the monster fun and exciting.",
								"Outside of its turn, a boss monster should be able to respond to the party's behavior through the use of extra abilities. Such abilities often take the form of reactions (directly responding to a trigger) and legendary actions (using an ability after a party member ends its turn), but variants of these abilities can work too if done right.",
								"To make a boss monster cool, it shouldn't be using the same abilities over and over again. Whether through a diverse pool of legendary actions or a sequence of scripted events, using different abilities as the rounds go on maintains the excitement and tension over the course of the fight."
