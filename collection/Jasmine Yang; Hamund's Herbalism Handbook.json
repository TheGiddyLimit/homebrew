When swallowed whole, they release a mouthful of fresh juice that actually provides all the hydration that the average humanoid needs in a day. While botanists have yet to figure out where these plants come from, the reigning theory is that they are the result of magical incursions and weaknesses between planes that result in certain places temporarily touching the Elemental Plane of Water. These seeds then spawn close to the surface of the sand, ready to be picked by whatever wandering creature is lucky enough to forage them. They are so prevalent and useful, that some desert cultures have taken to using them as currency in place of gold."

								"If you have ever played an open world fantasy RPGgame, chances are that it included some sort of mechanic to gather plants and herbs as you roam through the map. Other than providing useful buffs and abilities to the player, these herbs also serve as little pieces of worldbuilding\u2014changing availability as the environment does, or serving as quest items for NPCs.",
								"This book aims to provide that same experience, as well as to serve the needs of any DM whose players constantly ask them if they can forage something while out travelling between quest locations. This book contains over 160 unique herbs, designed to be usable in any campaign that a DM can slot in to provide a whole new dimension of exploration and world building to their games. There's also rules for foraging, some new spells, and a couple extra goodies.",

Through my many years of wandering these planes of existence, I have seen, done, and conquered just about everything the multiverse has to offer!",

Within these pages you will find not only an exhaustive compendium of useful plants and herbs you may find on your travels, but also instructions on how to forage for them, how to brew them into powerful tinctures, new spells to add to your arsenals, and also my many humorous thoughts and musings. Nature has grown these miracles for us, and after reading this book, you will know how to take them all for yourself!",
