						"Ancient stories tell of the creation of all existence by means of spoken words that spun reality from the void. The words of creation are powerful, but\u2014as light creates shadow\u2014so too does creation cause destruction. Whispers of the ancient words of creation seeped into the narrow spaces between existence and nonexistence, and those whispers echo to this day. The power-hungry, the desperate, and the mad can find such whispers\u2014with great effort and terrible risk. When spoken aloud or inscribed correctly, these words draw the power of nonexistence into the speaker's magic",
						"The ultimate source of power that drives void magic is unclear. In most respects, a void magic spell is nearly identical to conventional magic and reaches toward the same mystical forces for its energy. The addition of void speech into the spell's verbal component, however, subtly alters the spell at the moment of casting, so that the spell reaches beyond the usual wells of arcane or divine power to siphon energy from strange realms of darkness, madness, and horror.",
						"Several hypotheses exist to explain void magic's origin, from tapping the power of the Great Old Ones to drawing the last energy of a dying multiverse, but the truth is knotted in an enigma that can't be untied without tangling oneself in madness.",

								"At the heart of the enigmatic and dangerous school of void magic lies in void speech. The glyphs and spoken words of the void are the essence of oblivion given form. They exist in a paradoxical state, and as such they corrupt and degrade physical reality around them. Void speech is dangerous under any circumstance, even when not infused with magic. Those who correctly enunciated void speech find it impossible to comprehend, but they know in their bones that what they hear is terrible. Splitting headaches, sudden nosebleeds, spoiled food, and cracked glass follow a void speech pronouncement by a particularly powerful speaker.",
								"Inscribed void glyphs are not much safer. Readers often bleed from their eyes or suffer blurred vision. Paper bearing a glyph blackens over time, and even stone carved with the blasphemous glyphs eventually takes on a slimy texture and becomes pitted, corrupt, and foul. Explorers and scholars who stumble across a preserved void glyph have gone mad from the sudden shock to their souls. Despite the corrupting nature of such glyphs, the substance upon which they're inscribed never seems to degenerate completely\u2014it rots and becomes loathsome, but it seemingly lasts forever in that corrupted state.",

										"Void speech and the magic that derives from it thrives in the darkest places of creation. The Great Old Ones murmur it to their follows during cultists' grimmest nightmares. Creatures that dwell far from mortal worlds in the frigid black expanses between the stars came across the secrets long ago, catching whispers in the silence. Void dragons, star-spawn, and other hoarders of ancient knowledge and power possess scraps of speech cultivated into power.",
										"Chief among earthly creatures who gather and study the power of the void are the aboleth. Those ancient creatures discovered void speech long ago, when the nihileth returned from distant wanderings. Void speech formed the basis of the maddening glyph language that adorns their sunken cities.",
										"Wherever anyone utters void speech, no matter how well-meaning, darkness follows. Things from beyond hear the call and can follow its echo into existence. With sufficient study and practice, a speaker into the void can protect him or herself from the brunt of the horrors that arise and even turn deadly manifestations against foes. No amount of caution in using void speech and magic, however, can completely shield a practitioner from its corrupting nature. The void will have its due."

										"Void speech serves specific roles in the Midgard Campaign Setting. In the Western Wastes, massive, alien beings known to the inhabitants as Great Old Ones lumber across the blasted land. Dust goblins, selang, and aberrations scamper in the creatures' shadows and crawl over their twisted bodies in worship. These beings were originally called to Midgard from beyond the stars by void speech incantations. Their coming was a disaster that devastated the once fertile plains. Shamans and sorcerers among the twisted dust goblin tribes have puzzled out bits of void speech and wield the dark magic against their enemies.",
										"In the Southlands, void speech is most prevalent in the Abandoned Lands. The ramag are well aware of void speech and the horrors void magic can unleash. Their gatekeepers ruthlessly hunt down any rumor of void glyphs or speakers to cleanse that taint from the world. They struggle with unstable gateways and unpredictable magic, due in no small part to void magic.",

								"Void magic comprises a dangerous school of wizardry that exists alongside, but in the shadows of, the more well-known practices. This magic is anathema to existence itself, making it difficult to master and dangerous even to study. Dabblers rarely produce effects more profound than minor injury, property damage, and psychological scars to themselves and those around them. More serious investigations into void magic can spell disaster. Only alien creatures who psychology and physiology defy human understanding seem capable of commanding void magic with relative ease; even beings as anomalous as aboleths respect and fear the power of void magic.",
								"Void magic spells can never be added to a wizard's spellbook as part of the two spells learned automatically for gaining a level (with the exception of void savants; {@class wizard|phb|see below|Void Speaker|DM03}). To learn a void magic spell, a wizard must find an NPC void speaker who's willing to impart the knowledge or discover the spell written as a spell scroll, in a captured spellbook, carved on a temple wall, or some other form of recorded lore. Alternatively, if the GM allows it, a character who sees and hears a void magic spell being cast can add it to his or her spell book, using the same rules as transcribing a spell from a scroll.",
								"Despite void magic's strange origins, it still functions similarly to other arcane magic on a fundamental level. Void magic follows all the normal rules for spellcasting and is susceptible to dispelling, countermagic, and antimagic as normal. Void magic spells always have a verbal component and can't, under any circumstance, be cast without it."
