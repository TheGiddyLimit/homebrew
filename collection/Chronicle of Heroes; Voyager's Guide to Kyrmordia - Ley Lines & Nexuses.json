						"The Weave of magic, as it is known, permeates the entire known universe. But one may ask, what is magic? How is it structured, and is it never-ending? These are important questions that practitioners of the Art have studied for countless eons, in an effort to decrypt nature in itself. In Kyrmoria, magic is structured similarly to matter. If one looks to the fundamental level of existence, they will find mana, the building blocks of magic. Mana is a fickle thing, and it is unknown whether they possess any form of primordial sentience, but they exist everywhere and anywhere in the known world. And where mana flows greatly, imbuing the lands and oceans with its potency, rivers of mana form, namely, Ley Lines.",
						"Ley lines are channels that carry and allow mana, and to that extent magic, to flow across the world. They are pictured as \"lines\", only because they possess a sort of length and width that can be measured, if one is able to detect and trace them. Ley lines do not exist physically and are not tangible, even if they sometimes alter the environment around them. They course deep beneath the earth, in the water or in the air, like invisible streams. They are prone to shifting and changing their flow direction depending on the movement of celestial objects, and they very rarely remain in one place for an extended period of time. Furthermore, they come in many different sizes and potencies, which can change over time.",
						"It is possible to detect a ley line via standard divination magic methods, such as with a detect magic spell. To the observing caster, the ley line appears as a luminous torrent of energy motes, mana, which pulses with vibrant light of all possible colors, creating a magnificent spectacle. It is also known that a large enough obstacle, such as thick stone, can prevent any incoming visual signs of ley lines to such detection methods. As the ley lines shift and flow, intersecting or running parallel to one another, they are not unlike threads uniting to create a solid object. In the case of ley lines, this object is the Weave of magic. The Weave is a sort of veil, overlapping with all matter without taking up any real space. Through the weave, magic manifests in the world, and it is the Weave that spellcasters attempt to harness when casting their spells.",
						"There are numerous ways that spellcasters can access the mana laying dormant around them. Druids and rangers utilizing primal magic tap into the power of natural mana. Then, come the practitioners of arcane magic, the Art. Bards and wizards exert control over the mana around them, using words of power and gestures to guide the flow of mana, while sorcerers become conduits for mana, allowing it to flow through them and shaping it with their force of will. Warlocks are a curious case, in that they are granted a connection to the Weave through otherworldly powers that act as proxies, while the studious weaveknights lean in between wizardry and sorcery, learning how to shift the way the Weave overlaps with their own forms and keeping channeled mana inside their bodies to bolster their abilities. Next, the unique case of divine magic arises. Clerical powers and prayers function similarly to those of warlocks, in that they are also being tethered to the Weave through the will of a deity. Paladins, however, are a mystery, as it seems like the mana answers their call purely based on their inner ideals and goals. This interaction between the divine magic of paladins and mana, is what started the theory of mana having a sort of sentience and responding to the will of mortals.",
						"In rare cases, there is an ever more wondrous display and manifestation of the Weave. When many ley lines flow to the same point, the condensed mana becomes a local singularity, called a nexus of magic. Nexuses aren't permanent, as the ley lines forming them often drift apart after some amount of time, but their existence leaves a large impact on the world. They alter the geology and the environment around them, often imbuing natural minerals with mana, creating what is nowadays referred to as mana geodes. In addition, they literally change how reality and magic functions within the area they affect. Unlike ley lines, however, nexuses seem to have variations in what power they represent, different strains, as one might call them. There have been observations of nexuses that enhance specific schools of magic, and scarcely, of nexuses that physically manifest and transform the world around them in a way aligned with the ideals represented by a Divine Domain. As is natural, the appearance of a nexus stirs countries and factions in motion, in an effort to harness and understand its potency, often leading to conflicts.",

								"Creatures in the world that come across such powerful magical phenomena often attempt to meddle with them, to various degrees of success and failure. Contrary to what one might believe, mana in itself does not distinguish between masters of the arcane arts, religious acolytes or simply champions of the sword. Any creature can attempt to tap into these ever-moving batteries of raw magic, yet as is natural, powerful casters stand to benefit more from the influx of mana into their own reserves.",

If a creature has both a Challenge Rating and character levels, it adds the higher one of the two to the roll that determines the Tap Check result. This roll represents an attempt to tap into the mana, and it can't be altered, influenced or interacted with by any means sort of deific intervention or a wish spell unless specifically stated otherwise, but only at the GM's discretion."

												"For Nexuses, due to their immense power, the rules are a bit different. A benefit or penalty from a nexus's Beneficial Effects of Backlash tables lasts for the duration mentioned in that entry and doesn't end once a creature leaves the area affected by the nexus, along with any other specifications included in that entry. Some nexus entries state that they are irreversible by any means, however a GM might decide that they are too detrimental and elect to provide a way to undo them, In such cases, a wish spell shouldn't be enough, but the intervention of a deity or other similar power might do the trick.",
												"Finally, a creature can't gain multiple instances of the same benefit or penalty when tapping into a ley line or nexus, and it can't gain a permanent benefit or penalty more than once (in such cases, have the creature reroll on the appropriate table depending on its Tap check result)."

												"After determining the total for a Tap check, consult the {@table Tap Check Result|CoH-LLN} table below along with the Tap DC and Exhaustion Levels on Successful Tap columns of the table above to determine the outcome of the creature's attempt.",

He rolls a 15 on the {@dice d20}, making the total a 35.

												"While ley lines and nexuses exist in Kyrmoria and the world it lies on, you might want to incorporate them in your own world. If you choose to do so, ask yourself the following questions: What rules govern magic in my world, and what is the interaction between mana, ley lines, nexuses and magic? Are ley lines and nexuses static, or do they shift and flow depending on external influence? What powers do they possess, and how does harnessing or acquiring that power affect civilization? Do they change the environment, creating mana geodes, or some other mineral imbued with potent magic? Where are they located and why? How do people find them? Are they dense or scarce, and can they be damaged or destroyed? What legends or historical events are related to their existence?",
												"Nexuses are not given rules on how to locate them, because they can be very impactful on a story arc or adventure, even central. It is up to you, the GM, to decide when and where a Nexus forms, as well as what type of Nexus it is. Ultimately, such a powerful manifestation of the Weave serves to further the narrative. A good and quick rule of thumb however, is to have them appear on special days such as the Holy Day of a Deity, in a location where at least 4\u20135 major ley lines coincide or that is important to that Deity's mythos. Alternatively, it could be a location where powerful magical events took place, such as wars, or a place where magic from another plane is seeping in."
