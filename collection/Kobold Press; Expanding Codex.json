				"This gold amulet holds a preserved eye from a {@creature ziphius|CCodex}. It has 3 charges. As a bonus action, you can speak its command word, which expends 1 charge, and choose one creature within 60 feet that you can see. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or you create a temporary mental bond with the target until the start of your next turn. You can choose to gain advantage on attacks against the target or cause the target to have disadvantage on attacks against you. The amulet regains all expended charges daily at dawn."
