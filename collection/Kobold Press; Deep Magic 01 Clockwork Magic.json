						"While clockwork spells originated in Zobek and then appeared in the Midgard campaign setting, they can fit into your campaign world just as well. The most likely origins of the clockwork devices themselves are in ancient temples, where gears and simple machines were used to perform miracles for the gathered faithful. Descriptions of complex clockwork can be found in Chinese writing dating to over 2,500 years ago. The Antikythera mechanism, named for the Greek island near where it was discovered, is an example of a sophisticated clockwork device nearly 2,100 years old. It was likely used for astronomical navigation. In European history, this technology was never particularly widespread, and it was lost entirely after the Roman era. Given the late medieval or early renaissance era technology of the average fantasy campaign world, and the fact that most are replete with lost ancient empires, there's no reason that clockwork technology can't be widespread, or at least maintained in isolated pockets.",
						"The origins of clockwork magic, however, are nebulous at best. Those of a religious bent say that it's derived from the divine, that a follower of some god of smiths or machines or even time had an epiphany. Others, usually those of a less religious bent, claim that clockwork magic was the discovery of an ancient artificer who, while experimenting with gears and steam, built the first device animated by enchantments. Whatever its origin, clockwork magic involves time manipulation, constructs, and mechanical devices of all kinds.",

I wanted a few gearforged that weren't so noble but were a little more mysterious. The hellforged is to the gearforged as the tiefling is to the human; they have hints of dark secrets. While the disembodied spirit summoned by the ritual likely wants out of whatever place it was in, it doesn't want this. The ritual simply reaches out and snares a suitable candidate, willing or otherwise, by whatever means possible. Thus the ritual gives players a chance to be a monster not of their own making."

Symptoms appear in {@dice 1d4} days, beginning with an itchy rash around the site of the injury. Twenty-four hours later, the rash-covered skin peels off, revealing rusted metal. All effects that restore hit points are halved for the infected creature, including long rests; it recovers only half of its missing hit points from a long rest, but it still regains expended hit dice at the usual rate. At that point, the infected creature must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If it succeeds, the disease stops spreading but the healing penalty remains in effect. If the saving throw fails, the patch of rust spreads, the healing penalty remains, the creature loses 1 point of Dexterity, and it must repeat the saving throw after another 24 hours. The disease can be cured by {@spell lesser restoration} or comparable magic. Lost Dexterity can be restored by {@spell greater restoration}, or it returns naturally at the rate of 1 point after each long rest, once the disease is cured.",

Signs of infection appear immediately, with rust spreading across the creature's body. An infected construct has disadvantage on all saving throws, but it takes no other damage or penalty.

				"When you reach 6th level, you gain the ability to reshape metal with a touch. When you grasp a piece of metal of Small size or smaller, you can alter its form into any shape that suits your purpose. The item must be in your hands and under your control; you can't, for example, reshape a piece of armor or a weapon that's being worn or wielded by someone else. To create a specific object, such as a key or mechanical component, you must be completely familiar with it. Thus you could replicate a key that you had in your possession for an extended period of time, but you could not create a working key based on seeing the lock alone.",
				"Objects you create can have up to two hinges and a latch, but finer mechanical detail is not possible. This effect can be used to {@spell repair metal|DM01} as per the spell. You may use this feature once before completing a long or short rest."

As an action, you can compel one creature you can see within 60 feet of you to make an Intelligence saving throw against your wizard spell save DC. This is a magical effect. If the saving throw fails, the construct becomes friendly to you and obeys your commands for 1 hour, until you use this ability again, or until it takes damage from you or one of your allies. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the duration is extended to 6 hours or until one of the other conditions is fulfilled. When the effect ends, the construct is aware it was controlled by you."
