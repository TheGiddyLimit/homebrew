Large objects also tend to have more hit points than small ones, unless breaking a small part of the object is just as effective as breaking the whole thing. The {@table Object Hit Points|ASRT} table (based on {@table Object Hit Points|DMG|the one from pg247 of the DMG}) provides suggested hit points for fragile and resilient objects that are Huge or smaller.",
								"When using the {@table Object Hit Points|ASRT} table, first decide if the object is built stronger or weaker than normal, or has deteorated over time. A wooden gate at the entrance ofa cemetery is likely to have rotted over time, whereas the fence ofa new farm raising buffalo will have been built to withstand charges by the livestock. A fragile object will have half the HP ofa normal object, and a resilient object double.",

Any damage that fails to meet or exceed the object's damage threshold is considered superflcial and doesn't reduce the object's hit points. The {@table Damage Threshold *|ASRT|Damage Threshold} table sets minimum damage thresholds for different material types.",
