In some, they came from the Elemental Plane of Air, in others they were born of more natural ways. Regardless of their origin, divides among the ancient birdfolk gave birth to both the thrush and aarakocra species, each having their own unique characteristics and cultures. This divide is due to mainly thrush living for generations in their own mountaintop societies isolated from other humanoids."
