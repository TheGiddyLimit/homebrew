						"Module installation or removal can only be done at a workshop. Installing any module take 1 hour to complete. Workshops are available in most major cities. Private workshops can be built by creatures for 20,000 gp or rented for a negotiated price, typically 25 gp per workweek. Doing repairs in a workshop reduces the time spent depending on the quality of the workshop. Poor workshops provide adequate space to work. Fair workshops provide adequate space to work and reduce the price of repairing 1 module by 25%. Established workshops provide plenty of space to work and reduce the price to repair all modules by half. Well-Established workshops provide plenty of space to work and reduce the price to repair modules by three-quarters. The difference in price is due to the available tools and facilities within the workshop."

				"Oil is a viscous, flammable liquid used to fuel lamps. It typically comes in a clay flask that holds 1 pint or a cask that holds 80 pints.",
				"As an action, you can splash oil from a flask onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw it up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a target creature or object, treating the oil as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target is covered in oil. If the target takes any fire damage before the oil dries (1 minute after application), the target takes an additional 5 fire damage from the burning oil. You can also pour a flask of oil on the ground to cover a 5-foot-square area, provided that the surface is level. Alternately, you can unstop a cask of oil, causing oil to flow out onto the ground and, within two rounds, cover an area with a 20-foot radius around the cask. If lit, the oil burns for 2 rounds and deals 5 fire damage to any creature that enters the area or ends its turn in the area. A creature can take this damage only once per turn."
