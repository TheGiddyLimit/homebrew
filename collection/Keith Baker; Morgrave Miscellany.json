If it consumes the creature, nothing remains, including its equipment, and the duration of the transformation increases by 1 minute and you regain a number of hit points equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum 1).",

On a success, the symbiont continues to obey your commands, or you can end the transformation early. On a failure, the symbiont spends its turn to consume the creature and the DC increases by 5. You can fail each check (Deception, Intimidation, or Persuasion) only once each transformation, and lose control of the symbiont completely when none remain. If you lose control of the symbiont while it frenzies, it becomes hostile to all creatures and spends its turns pursuing and attacking the nearest creature to the best of its ability until the transformation ends."

					"An aberrant dragonmark is a gift of mystical power, though it can be a painful and distressing curse to bear, and its powers might even be difficult or, in some cases, impossible to control. The legendary Lady of the Plague was responsible for the deaths of thousands before she learned to control her abilities. Even an ability that duplicates a spell as simple as fire bolt can be devastating to the individual, and a person who possesses such a mark could have killed friends or even destroyed city blocks in a fiery blaze before mastering this power. This has led the common people to fear those who carry aberrant marks, paranoid that all of them could be murderers, mad, or both. The progenitor dragon Khyber is said to be the source of all things monstrous and evil, and those who carry aberrant dragonmarks in adolescence are called Children of Khyber.",
					"The Aberrant Dragonmark feat in the Wayfinder's Guide to Eberron allows a character to manifest an aberrant dragonmark over the course of a campaign. A Child of Khyber has developed their mark earlier in their life and faced prejudice because of this tragic but rare power. An aberrant mark can appear on members of almost any race or family that has been recorded to bear a dragonmark, and a Child of Khyber chooses a subrace to define their original racial identity.",
					{
						"name": "Defining Tragedy",
						"entries": [
							"Whether it occurred the first time an aberrant mark manifested or before mastery of its abilities, aberrant marks are usually central to a terrible tragedy that has had a deep and lasting impact. The consequences of this event could be public and social, an ongoing scar to a reputation, or they could be secret and deeply personal. Many a Child of Khyber has caused the death of a loved one with their mark and fled, ashamed of the embarrassment, but never publicly tried with the crime. In their deepest sleep, most aberrant marked relive these nightmares, which prove more prevalent than any the Quori might dream up. The road to self-forgiveness is often as fraught as the mark itself. You can use the Defining Tragedy table as a source of inspiration to determine the tragic past of your character. Work with your DM to finalize the details of your personal tragedy and to understand how it could play a role in your ongoing story. Be sure to consider the nature of your mark as you develop your story. It's easy to see how the fireball spell could be responsible for a death, while a generally harmless and more subtle mark containing the suggestion spell could still have unexpected consequences, like triggering a riot or pushing an individual to the brink of madness.",

Whatever path you followed, you had a good life once, but now adventuring is all you have left.",

Work with your DM to find inspiration in some of the other backgrounds, and adapt their story to suit the life you now lead, especially when starting a campaign at zero level. How have you dealt with your aberrant mark? What have you been forced to do? Here are some examples of how you might tie your background into the campaign moving forward.",
							"• Charlatan. You've hidden your aberrant mark from others. A talent for disguise helps you physically conceal the mark, while your proficiency with Deception helps ward off suspicion.",
							"• Criminal. You've descended into the underworld and used your mark for personal profit. The Wayfinder's Guide to Eberron describes House Tarkanan, a gang comprised of people with aberrant marks, and you could use your new skills to establish a connection with House Tarkanan.",
							"• Outlander. You fled civilization after manifesting your dragonmark and lived in the wilds ever since your defining tragedy. Now, something has called you back, ready to make a difference.",
							"• Urchin. You stayed in the city but clung to the shadows, eking out a life in alleys and sewers. You didn't become a criminal, but you've fought a bitter struggle for survival with nowhere else to turn.",
							"While you've been forced from your previous life, the benefits of your first background still linger. If you're a noble, you have your Position of Privilege and can demand entry to court. As a soldier, you could still assert your Military Rank. As an entertainer, you might still be in demand. In all three of these examples, that first benefit could have been tainted by your aberrant mark, and you should work with your Dungeon Master to see if this will impact the campaign you're set to embark. Those in court will likely respond to your rank or status, until they realize you're a Child of Khyber, and you'll have to deal with their fears and suspicions once you've placed yourself in the spotlight.",
							"While creating a Child of Khyber, think about the life you once led, the path you're on now, and the tragedies that you've endured along the way. Together these create a unique and, like the dragonmark you possess, distinguished impact on the world of Eberron."

Aaren was a philosopher searching for meaning, but House Cannith was only interested in weapons. Succeeding in repurposing Aaren's work, the moniker \"warforged\" was Merrix's invention, and cemented the martial purpose of the beings in their very identity. Aaren d'Cannith protested what he saw as the abuse of his creations and fought to prevent the production of warforged soldiers. For his efforts, Aaren was excoriated from House Cannith in 970 YK and disappeared into the shadows of Khorvaire.",
							"Despite his best efforts, Aaren lacked the resources to change the course of House Cannith and he was furious that his creations were being condemned to the drudgery of lives in a state of endless war. His obsession with stopping the war led him to prioritize his remaining assets toward further research, working to understand the warforged he had created more fully. Any spare time was devoted to his second love, the Draconic Prophecy, and over time these two obsessions blended together in more than philosophical terms. Aaren located a rare convergence of planar influence somewhere along the borders of Cyre and constructed a hidden forgehold, which he would later dub the \"Dragonforge\" in his notes. He experimented with unusual materials, blending dragon scale and bone into the construction of the warforged, and timing the moment of creation to align with the planes and moons. In 993 YK, he created the first of his dragonforged. He continued to develop and train these living constructs, but his efforts were brought to a sudden halt by the devastation of the Mourning.",
							"Rumored to have been away from his Dragonforge on the Day of Mourning in 994 YK, Aaren hasn't been seen since, while the location of his forgehold and the creation process of the dragonforged remain entirely unknown, save for scattered pages of partial notes found by relic hunters and scavengers across the wastes and craters of the Mournlands. Treasure seekers believe the presence of these notes would indicate that the Dragonforge was lost in the devastation of the cataclysm, its workshops collapsed, and enchantments broken or transformed into deadly living spells that wander the badlands.",
							"However, the existence of these dragonforged, all seemingly unaffected as the Mourning obliterated Cyre, and their inability or unwillingness to recall the events surrounding their appearance, leave some to wonder if they are simply agents of a conspiracy to misinform any possible explorers, or to keep House Cannith from corrupting this contribution as Aaren's father did before. In the wrong hands, a Dragonforge might recalibrate the draconic prophecy, possibly altering Eberron's future in unimaginable ways.",
							"Regardless of whether Aaren d'Cannith returns, or if the Mourning buried the Dragonforge in rubble and forced the dragonforged, alone and afraid, into the shattered lands of Cyre, these draconic constructs have been left to find their own way in the world, and not even Aaren knows if they will fulfill their part in the Prophecy.",

An urchin born in Sharn has no interest in gold or glory, but has never met a tower that couldn't be climbed. Most of all, an extreme explorer is an adventurer, ever ready for the next challenge.",
