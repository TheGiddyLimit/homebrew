This is why most genasi have never met their genie parent. However, depending on the genie type, the relationship might be different. Air genasi children, born from Djinni, are more likely to still be in contact, as those are more likely to believe it was fate the child was born. Earth genasi, born from Dao, would have been tossed aside, as soon as their parent realised that a child isn't as precious as gold and gems. Fire genasi children, from Efreeti, usually were taken away, as their mortal parent would have protected them from a life of servitude. Light genasi children, born from Pari, often seek to break contact themselves, as their parent would coddle them too much. Shadow genasi children, born from Hamzadi, would likely just have found themselves neglected by their parent. Water genasi children, born from marid, would have been discarded as their parent would have considered them a stain on noble title."
