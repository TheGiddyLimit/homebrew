During their first forays into the city, the characters witness the strange magic of delerium and contend with the mysterious Haze. The threat of contamination makes survival in Drakkenheim difficult and dangerous. The characters may seek assistance and resources from the five factions to accomplish their goals and find a way deeper into the city.",

Each organization has a different vision for the future of Drakkenheim, and the tenuous peace won't last much longer. Nevertheless, with the support of one or more of these groups, the characters can explore dangerous Inner City locations such as the Cathedral of Saint Vitruvio, the Inscrutable Tower of the Amethyst Academy, or perhaps even mount an expedition into the crater. Characters may unearth stunning revelations from Drakkenheim's past and recover powerful artifact which threaten the balance of power between the factions. They might even discover how the Haze threatens to engulf the world itself.",
								"The factions are deeply divided over what must be done to solve these problems. As a result, simmering tensions boil over into outright conflict. As the city streets become a battlefield between the organizations, the faction leaders each demand the characters' loyalty. Now, the characters must decide which factions are their allies, and which are their enemies. Eventually, the unraveling situation may require the characters to act directly against one or more of the factions, who respond with counterstrikes of their own. In turn, the characters may launch major assaults against enemy factions to destroy their strongholds, defeat their leaders, and drive them out of Drakkenheim. As the conflict reaches its zenith, the surviving factions set their master plans into motion, requiring an expedition into Castle Drakken. There, a final showdown will decide the fate of Drakkenheim."

The two spent vast sums commissioning the clergy of the Sacred Flame and the mages of the Amethyst Academy to use divination magic to discern what happened, but to no avail. They nearly bankrupted themselves by launching multiple large-scale military expeditions attempting to reclaim Drakkenheim, all of which failed. Eventually, Mannfred became convinced further efforts were futile, and proposed he would take up the crown and relocate the capital. However, Cecilia contested the claim, arguing there was no conclusive evidence that confirmed their brother and his children were dead. The nobility was divided over the issue, and a civil war ensued that raged for nearly a decade. As Westemär itself descended into political and financial ruin, Mannfred von Kessel and his children were assassinated in a dramatic betrayal.

Using this information, it's up to you to determine how the factions might help or hinder the player characters during their adventures in Drakkenheim.",
								"Rather than uniting the factions as one against a common foe, the player characters must navigate a fractious web of intrigue, negotiation, sabotage, and violent conflict if they wish to uncover the greatest treasures and secrets in Drakkenheim. Their relationships with each faction will naturally develop as a consequence of the character's choices, but it's ultimately up to them to decide who they want to join and who they will oppose. Thus, each individual faction might become a supportive patron, fierce competitor, close ally, bitter enemy, or anything in between.",

Correspondingly, the factions need the player characters' help to accomplish their own goals in the city, and offer rewards to their allies and assistance with the characters' personal quests. Conversely, factions that become antagonistic create dynamic problems and new complications throughout the campaign when they use their resources against the characters. Either way, the factions are best played in a reactive manner. Their leaders make firm demands when characters try to negotiate, orchestrate counterstrikes when characters foil their plans, and conduct sabotage when characters oppose their goals.",

Don't be afraid of letting the players get in over their heads if they make enemies with more than one faction, either. Your players will find surprising ways to foil the factions, and develop cunning plans when they collaborate with them.

Diplomatic characters could negotiate an alliance, truce, or ceasefire between two (or more) factions. Convincing any two factions to set aside their differences and work together should be difficult, but achievable. In order to broker such a deal, characters will need to demonstrate how the alliance will help both factions achieve their objectives, but also make an appeal to the roleplaying traits, ideals, bonds, and flaws of the factions and their leaders. These tense negotiations can make for some of the most memorable moments in the campaign, so potential alliances are best arranged in dramatic locations such as the faction strongholds and the Cathedral of Saint Vitruvio.",

Countless situations in your campaign may emerge that could cause the factions to re-evaluate their priorities, and clever and convincing players might present compelling arguments. Bear in mind of course, that the factions are composed of people: and people don't always act in logical ways. These alliances are always unstable, however, as each faction presses to have their own goals prioritized. Unless the player characters make an ongoing effort to keep a coalition together, any alliance between factions will inevitably collapse.",

The faction is small and outwardly aloof, yet subtly influential and tremendously wealthy. They are led by a shadowy directorate of powerful archmages who dispatched Archwizard {@creature Eldrick Runeweaver|DungeonsDrakkenheim} to oversee their operations in Drakkenheim. Most of its members are potent arcane spellcasters with access to rare magical resources, but only a handful of agents are active in Drakkenheim.",

										"The Amethyst Academy began as a secret school for young sorcerers during a time when arcane magic faced extreme persecution from the clergy of the Sacred Flame. The mages located children who manifested magical talents, rescued them from their fearful and paranoid communities, and educated them in hidden strongholds and far-away castles so they might wield their abilities with trained and refined control. The secret school gradually grew into a secret society in its own right.",
										"Sequestered in unseen universities to hide from the mage-slaying Knights of the Silver Order, the mages pooled their knowledge. They conducted research into arcane and cosmological phenomena, and developed the modern practice of wizardry. Over time, the Amethyst Academy secured allies amongst the nobility by providing them clandestine magical services and occult counsel, crafting enchanted heirlooms, protecting their castles with arcane wards, and teaching their heirs magic.",

										"When these schemes were discovered by the Faith of the Sacred Flame, a renewed series of brutal inquisitions and vengeful witch-hunts began. What had been a shadow conflict between paladins and sorcerers for centuries spilled into outright war between noble houses who championed the Faith, and those that supported the Amethyst Academy. These conflicts ended with the {@area Edicts of Lumen|70a|x} (detailed in {@adventure Appendix E|DungeonsDrakkenheim|14}). Enacted three hundred years ago, this landmark treaty stopped the murderous suppression of arcane magic by the religious ministry, and established a new balance of power between mages, the Faith, and the nobility throughout the continent.",
										"The Edicts of Lumen bestow extensive protections, full autonomy, and economic advantages to the Amethyst Academy, but also require the Academy to observe strict standards of mercantile neutrality and political non-intervention. Most importantly, it grants the Amethyst Academy guardianship of any child who demonstrates magical aptitude until they come of age and master their abilities. In exchange, the agreement stipulates that all arcane spellcasters are disinherited from any land, rank, or titles, including the scions of noble and royal families. Since the Edicts, Academy mages may work magic without fear of oppression from church or state, though the organization remains withdrawn as it increasingly turns its attention to global affairs and extraplanar happenings. However, the direction and focus of the Amethyst Academy has dramatically shifted following the destruction of Drakkenheim, when their greatest stronghold was cut off from them.",
										"While the Amethyst Academy outwardly upholds the Edicts of Lumen, in recent years some have claimed the mages furtively flaunt its restrictions and disregard the terms that forbid dark magical practices. Others suspect the mages are weaving an arcane conspiracy to control commerce and influence politics while shielding themselves from the wrath of the Sacred Flame."

However, other factions are now moving to reclaim Drakkenheim and potentially install a new ruling dynasty. Such political upheavals could affect the Academy's ability to research and harvest delerium. The Academy does not want a ruler who will destroy delerium, force the Academy to pay exorbitant sums to obtain it, or impose conditions on how the Academy may use the crystals.",

A decade before the meteor destroyed Drakkenheim, she beheld a vision of a falling star that would arrive on earth and signal a great upheaval for the faithful.

She spent several years afterwards contemplating the heavens and several strange stones recovered from the city. Her conclusion was dire indeed: the world stands on the precipice of darkness unending. Yet within delerium, she saw the spark of salvation. Though the stones are the stuff of chaos, black charcoal and midnight oil may fuel a great flame. Perhaps if taken up by righteous souls, the crystals might become an earthly vessel for the Sacred Flame itself. Rather than fall to all-consuming shadows, Lucretia Mathias prophesied a New Age of Heroes that could meet the coming night. She spoke widely about her beliefs and discoveries, and her fiery sermons galvanized a throng of loyal supporters who proselytized her new creed across Elyria, Westemär, and Caspia. As her support grew, she resolved to make a pilgrimage to the crater itself to confirm her revelations.",

Three years ago, they marshaled up the remnants of the royal guard, the city watch, and patriotic veterans of the civil war to make one last-ditch attempt to retake the city. Although officially dubbed the 4th Provisional Expeditionary Force to Reclaim the Capital, this guerilla regiment was nicknamed after oil lamps carried by the old city watch: the Hooded Lanterns.",

Few honest soldiers survived the civil war, so many veterans have a life of bloody deeds behind them already.

As such, many possess naïve and idealistic notions honed into simmering rage and fury at a golden age stolen from them.",

Rather than making an all-out assault on the ruins, they have taken a methodical approach.

This strategy has paid off: the Hooded Lanterns have managed to establish countless safehouses and supply caches within the city. They captured Shepherd's Gate and the Drakkenheim Garrison last year. However, in recent months their efforts have been stymied by sabotage enacted by the {@creature Queen of Thieves|DungeonsDrakkenheim}, and the emergence of a horrific {@creature Gnoll||garmyr} warlord in the Inner City known as the {@creature Lord of the Feast|DungeonsDrakkenheim}. While the Hooded Lanterns have imposed the mantle of law-and-order in the city, these setbacks have revealed their actual authority is limited to their strength of arms. The regiment maintains only a fragile foothold in Drakkenheim, and their supply lines are now exceptionally difficult to maintain.

Nevertheless, staunch supporters of the Silver Order argue that their deeds were indeed justified. Decisive action is necessary to defend the innocent and the faithful from wicked sorcerers who sought to dominate others with magical might, or cut down foul warlocks who spread wickedness through demonology and necromancy.

Many residences are abandoned and slowly deteriorating with their windows and doors nailed shut. However, the village centre is alive with activity. Conversation, laughter, and music resound from several taverns along the main thoroughfare. Amidst a bustling market square, a small crowd of adventurers, merchants, and prospectors busily traffic all manner of weapons, equipment, coins, recovered treasures, and a few strange glimmering crystals.

										"As the town lies some five miles south of the capital city, it was not directly damaged by the meteor shower, though the impact shattered the windows of every building, caused some weaker structures to collapse, and left some in the village {@condition blinded} or {@condition deafened}. Unfortunately, the aftermath was all the more terrible. Over the past fifteen years, the contamination in Drakkenheim has affected the countryside for miles around. The once fertile fields and dense woods are now barren and dying. Gradually, most folk gave up, departing for safer and more prosperous places. A few people remained behind, determined to hold onto their family homes and salvage their livelihoods.",
										"Emberwood Village persisted despite the odds. After the civil war, adventurers began showing up in the town. Explorers heading towards the dark city needed a safe place to tend their wounds and rest, and so Emberwood Village gradually became a sort of boom town on a new frontier for adventure."

Decades ago, these were the choice watering holes for lower-class labourers, sweat-soaked craftspeople, and assorted scoundrels who inhabited Drakkenheim. Today, Buckledown Row is a hub for outlaws, outcasts, scavengers, and worse. The taverns are mostly intact, and close enough to the edge of town for a band of rough-and-tumble ruffians to make the trek easy enough, but still far enough into the city to dissuade others from following. Ever since the Queen of Thieves brought the gangs under her influence, the street has been controlled by the Queen's Men: bandits and brigands meet here on neutral ground, join in revelry together, trade with fences and smugglers, and only occasionally slit each other's throats. There's few rules and even less order. Flowing ale and gold tend to calm the most violent disputes, but for anything else the hidden fighting pit is the perfect place to settle feuds, make some bets, and lose a few teeth.",

The gangs are gaining so many members that if you are in Buckledown Row, most assume you ought to be there. Discussing other factions, or any plans or adventures that seem suspicious, might arouse the attention of people nearby. Also if the party is acting awkward or nervous, this may draw attention - it may also help their cause to dress in appropriate gang attire or to have symbols of a gang on their gear. Again, the {@area Outlaws and Scoundrels|183|x} detailed in the {@area Queen's Men Dossier|16e|x} can provide information the party might gather to help them disguise themselves or hatch a plan to fit in. If the party openly approaches a gang leader without invitation, they may gain some attention as well, but most of the leaders are eager to hear out anyone bold enough to approach them and will engage with the party in amused curiosity. Otherwise the gangs accept the characters as more new recruits and try and encourage them with drinking, games, sometimes a fight, or a game of cards. Or maybe trying to push them to join the fighting pits below."

The attendants use their powers to appear as humans garbed in flowing blue robes to lure and deceive visitors, but their mutations are more horrific than the aquatic delerium dregs, whom they regard as their subservient kin. Their original memories and personalities have been nearly obliterated by madness, and they now loyally serve the Duchess' strange agenda. They tend the Monument of the Duchess in the {@area Bathhouse Ruins|42b|x}.

Argonath gave their life in that battle, and Saint Vitruvio subsequently died slaying the half-dragon warlock behind the terrible scourge. Their bones and equipment have been kept as holy relics since, as Saint Vitruvio prophesied the gold dragon could be resurrected should Drakkenheim ever fall to darkness.",

Long before, the site was home to several crypts and crematory gardens, and the dead are still interred in the catacombs below the contemporary building. Following its completion, worshippers would travel for miles around to make prayers and offerings to the Sacred Flame here. After the meteor fell, these hallowed halls became a charnel house - the lair of the monstrous {@creature Lord of the Feast|DungeonsDrakkenheim}.",

As such, the otherwise lightly defended abbey is an ideal sanctuary for the most devoted adherents of the Falling Fire.

Unfortunately, unless a new monarch is firmly established in another city (see \"{@area Restoring the Throne|62c|x}\" above), the political outcome for Westemär is grim.

Once cast, the spell is indeed powerful enough to halt expansion of the Haze, effectively turning Drakkenheim into a greenhouse where the Amethyst Academy may harvest and study delerium at their sole discretion. Thereafter, only Academy mages and their designated allies are permitted through the barrier. A few scavengers and looters find secret tunnels and hidden means of entry, and occasionally, monsters escape via the river or underground passages. The city remains a dangerous place, but one largely quarantined within the colossal prismatic barrier. However, rather than strip-mine delerium, the Academy carefully cultivates it. The barrier remains indefinitely, because the Academy intentionally allows more delerium to grow within to maintain their supply. The Amethyst Academy uses its newfound wealth and influence to clandestinely reshape the political destiny of the continent, and possibly even unravel the Edicts of Lumen.",
										"Nevertheless, should the prismatic barrier fall through sabotage or negligence, the results would be appropriately catastrophic. The feedback force shatters the Inscrutable Tower and causes the Haze to violently explode outward for hundreds of miles around. The volatile magic greatly accelerates the expansion of the Haze, and the world is destroyed only a few years later."
