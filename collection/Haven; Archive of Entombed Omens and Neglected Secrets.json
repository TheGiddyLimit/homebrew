As they master their abilities, Dungeon Keepers become absolute rulers of the domains they choose and create labyrinths of death and destruction where none dare tread.",

By embedding a knot of gems in stone, groups of gemlins can spawn additional gemlin juveniles. The process leaves a pocket of weakened stone behind as the juvenile frees itself from the surrounding rock.",

Gemlins are more than happy to exchange the 'useless' treasures they find when digging for more gems. These treasures include precious metals, long-lost magical items, maps of dangerous tunnels, and duergar patrol routes. The promise of barter or a share of the loot makes gemlin colonies valuable allies for parties of adventurers who brave the Underdark in search of subterranean dragons or other monsters with vast hoards. Gemlins loathe xorn and dragons, and are eager to pounce on any indirect contribution they can make to such creatures' downfall.",
                    "The jewels embedded in a gemlin's body also determine its powers. Gemlin are tenacious guerilla fighters, using their earth glide to slip through solid walls and fire hurricanes of lesser magic before fleeing. Older gemlins, which accumulate crystals with age, wield a diverse array of dazzling magic. The oldest and largest of these gemlins become gemlin progenitors, by removing some gems and planting them bedrock to found a new colony.",

                    "Most progenitors adopt this role out of a sense of responsibility. Progenitors are almost invariably the gemlins that removed crystals from their own bodies and embedded them in stone, causing them to grow into new gemlin juveniles. Older adult gemlins gain the same powers and statistics as their progenitor parent in due time, but the original colony's founder almost always has final say.",
                    "<b>Jewel Seekers</b> Gemlins adore precious stones, which are vital to their life cycle and, to them, the peak of natural beauty. By embedding a knot of gems in stone, groups of gemlins can spawn additional gemlin juveniles. The process leaves a pocket of weakened stone behind as the juvenile frees itself from the surrounding rock.",
                    "Enterprising traders whose routes take them underground often exploit this desire. Gemlins are more than happy to exchange the 'useless' treasures they find when digging for more gems. These treasures include precious metals, long-lost magical items, maps of dangerous tunnels, and duergar patrol routes. The promise of barter or a share of the loot makes gemlin colonies valuable allies for parties of adventurers who brave the Underdark in search of subterranean dragons or other monsters with vast hoards. Gemlins loathe xorn and dragons, and are eager to pounce on any indirect contribution they can make to such creatures' downfall.",
                    "The jewels embedded in a gemlin's body also determine its powers. Gemlin are tenacious guerilla fighters, using their earth glide to slip through solid walls and fire hurricanes of lesser magic before fleeing. Older gemlins, which accumulate crystals with age, wield a diverse array of dazzling magic. The oldest and largest of these gemlins become gemlin progenitors, by removing some gems and planting them bedrock to found a new colony.",

                    "Adventurers who explore primeval jungles and vast prairies untouched by humanoid hands often encounter hell pigs. These distorted ancestors of modern swine boast a massive frame and vicious ferocity that they use against their prey to terrible effect.",
                    "Like domesticated pigs, hell pigs will eat anything they can fit into their mouths. Hell pigs' jaws are far larger than an ordinary swine's, and filled with serrated teeth backed by an incredible bite force able to snap bone and shred muscle.",
                    "A hell pig hunts by charging forward and goring its target with its tusks before sinking its jaws into the fallen creature and biting its body in half. When weary or lazy, hell pigs also root for fungi and strip leaves from shrubs and trees. They may even destroy rotten stumps and feast on the insect life within. Their gluttonous feasting swells the humps on their backs with fat, which in turn nourishes them in lean times. Some druid circles believe this fat, when made into a candle and used to burn leaves, will enrich plant growth for miles around the flame.",
                    "A hell pig's sumptuous diet and ferocious appetite makes them take on a bulky and bloated appearance that belies their speed. A hell pig is surprisingly agile, able to maintain pace with a trotting horse and easily overcome most runners on foot. Their ferocious territorial behavior sends them charging down any intruder, leaving them with a terrible choice: run and be gored, or stand their ground and be bitten in two."

                    "A perplexing combination of memory and malice, mist mimics are bizarre creatures that combine tangible essence with airy illusion. Nebulous and indistinguishable from fog in their natural state, mist mimics coalesce into tangible creatures when they encounter a dying humanoid.",
                    "Like their monstrosity cousins, mist mimics disguise themselves as inanimate objects, waiting months or years for a victim. When a weak or dying humanoid emerges, the mist mimic transforms into tendrils of ghastly fog and spirits away its final breaths. It inhales its prey's dying thoughts and final memories, which bolster its disturbing propensity for mimicry. Its abnormal intelligence and near-perfect replication of the deceased's personality allows it to take their place or exploit their identity for the mimic's own purposes. Experienced mimics accumulate an arsenal of personalities and appearances. This haunting tableau of stolen identities allows them to adapt to social environs far beyond the dungeons where they make their home.",
                    "Unlike many ambush predators, mist mimics are potent fighters in open combat. Its true nature as an air elemental allows it to conjure hurricane-force winds that hurl close-ranged enemies. When ambushing weaker enemies of inferior constitution, the mist mimic entangles them in a whirlwind, rips the breath from their lungs, and prepares to gather their memories. These cruel creatures often weaponize the faces of fallen loved ones against their foes, which makes any confrontation with a mist mimic a traumatic experience in more ways than one."

With these powers, they construct intricate streets covered in rubble and palatial complexes that appear weathered and worn.",
                    "Their behavior puzzles scholars, and the ruin builders are too absorbed in their labor to answer questions. Some believe they are the creations of a bygone empire–builders and laborers that outlasted their creators and mindlessly replicate all the flaws of a collapsed model city.",
                    "Others speculate the ruin builders' ruins have some magical significance, perhaps connecting together to form the bedrock of a vast ritual circle.",
                    "Whatever their motivations, the ruin builders are largely harmless. They only resort to violence when attacked, move slowly to allow others to evade their inexorable construction, and even move immobile animals and humanoids out of their way before they raise stones and seal mortar. However, they have no interest in territorial borders; many underground urbanites have woken to find their basement converted into a pathway leading to a massive subterranean metropolis. Sewer systems have been sealed or rerouted overnight by the ruin builders' tireless labor, and entire subterranean city blocks are molded into a mess of defunct stone overnight."

Even the slightest sound resurrects the horrific trauma of its last moments, which it otherwise cannot remember. The aura of silence protects them from the horror of their last moments, which lends adventures that battle them a powerful advantage: a silent banshee that hears its own voice dies instantly. Scholars of the undead speculate that the banshee's spirit relives its own death when it hears its voice. The power of this traumatic memory overcomes the banshee and either destroys its will to continue, or 'reminds' its restless spirit that it has died and allows it to pass on peacefully. Whatever the reason, dispelling the aura of silence is a surefire way to destroy the banshee."
