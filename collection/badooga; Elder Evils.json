One by one, the heroes fell, the flesh of their bodies flung up in the orgy of violence, trailing ropes of dark blood to the sounds of their screams. It was too much for the ranger named Giorge, and he set aside his courage and fled into the black tunnels.",

He ran for what might have been minutes but felt like days and in his panic, he lost track of where he was, losing himself in the bleak corridors and the rusting rails of the accursed mines. When his breath came in hitches and the pain in his side forced him to stop, he collapsed, tears pouring from his eyes, little sobs escaping from his dry and cracked lips. He knew he would die. The sounds of his pursuers were close. Too close.",

He was about to stand\u2014to make his final desperate attempt to kill his foes\u2014when something wet and black and awful curled around his ankle.

Giorge's sudden arrival and the approach of more fishfolk hunters caused the great horror to awaken and snatch Giorge, plunging the mortal into the thickened waters contaminated by its rot. Beneath the churning surface, the entity known as Shothragot infested Giorge's mind, rent his spirit, and seized his body, transforming it into something else entirely.",

But the thing in the pool was not through with its first disciple.",

Giorge, then, is an extension of the elder evil's will. He travels endlessly, moving through the lands, always watching and searching for those marked for death. He is a reluctant servant, haunted by the memories of his life before the touch of evil, and he despairs about his fate.

Perhaps the most disturbing thing about Zargon is the bulging bloody eye just below his horn.",
					"The rest of Zargon's form is no less repellent. A muscular torso bears the signs of countless injuries, crisscrossed with seeping wounds and pestilential tumors. In place of arms, Zargon has a knot of flesh at each shoulder, from which six long tentacles whip out, each with a thorny barb perfect for embedding into flesh and bone and holding victims fast.",
					"Six thick, muscled tentacles grow from the base of his trunk, and when he moves, one or more of these appendages darts out to find purchase and drag his awfulness forward, leaving a stinking trail of bloody slime, fingers, slippery organs, and other undigested flesh wherever he travels."

If you wish to get around this, consider informing your players of this trait ahead of time so that they can come up with a plan to get around it. You may want to roll with what they come up with, or you can devise your own method for the party to get around it, such as an artifact that converts divine spells into regular arcane magic when held by a divine spellcaster. Or perhaps you want to just remove the trait, perhaps replacing it with a different malefic property, or just excluding it altogether. This is completely fine, and won't affect encounter difficulty too much, as these stat blocks are not specifically balanced around it. If you do keep it in, make it another obstacle to overcome, rather than an unfair roadblock that the players weren't expecting."

Avolakia clerics make good use of the {@spell create undead} spell to create undead such as ghasts and wights. They often arm these greater undead with magic weapons, armor, and wondrous items to aid them in defending the avolakias' territory.",

The creatures typically establish settlements beneath the communities of surface races, then use their Shapechanger and {@spell suggestion} abilities to infiltrate their target areas. Often a group of avolakias infiltrates a local religious institution and attempts to assume control of the funerary rites for the community. Should the avolakias succeed, they have access to plenty of corpses that they can use to create more undead. In addition, the disguised avolakias are in a perfect position to corrupt selected members of the community and slowly indoctrinate them into the {@cult Kyuss the Worm That Walks|EdE|cult of Kyuss}.",
							"Avolakias also interact with various Underdark races. Some, such as the drow, they infiltrate in much the same way as they do surface races. With others, such as mind flayers, they openly propose alliances for the two groups' mutual benefit. A typical agreement between mind flayers and avolakias stipulates that both groups hunt down and capture intelligent beings. The mind flayers consume the unfortunate victims' brains, then hand the bodies over to the avolakias, who use them to create undead. But such alliances tend to fall apart eventually, either when the mind flayers enslave captives for long periods before consuming their brains, or when the avolakias kill a few mind flayers to make more powerful undead creatures."

Avamerin unknowingly spread this message to the mortal civlizations, allowing for this revelation to become public and for godless priests to become more and more common throughout the world.",
					"The gods punished Avamerin for this transgression by demoting him from solar to planetar. Enraged, Avamerin cast aside his servitude and stole Sertrous's head, claiming that the dead demon was wiser than the gods. In response, the gods took away his angelic beauty and replaced it with the visage of a snake, and then banished him from the Upper Planes forever. Yet the damage had been done. The angel became the First Heretic, and he devoted the rest of his existence to serving the one who had opened his eyes. In time, the devotion of Avamerin and those he recruited to his Vanguard would be enough to restore Sertrous to life and prove what the fallen angel had come to believe was the truth beyond the lies of faith."

One reason for this is that each individual Hulk is much weaker than many of the monsters out there. Even Soelma and Janwulf are higher in CR than an individual Hulk. Rather, the global threat posed by the Hulks' Blood Moon sign makes them a world-ending threat; additionally, the five Hulks are designed to be a challenge even for high level characters when fought all at once.",
							"The second reason for this is that there is so much missed potential for their story. The original Elder Evils book describes that the Hulks are part of an alien race that sent them to colonize the campaign setting; once they awaken and eradicate all sapient life on the planet, they will give birth to the \"Children of Zoretha\". Such children were not given statistics nor descriptions in the original book, as it is assumed that the players will defeat the Hulks before they have a chance to give birth to them.",
							"However, what if a DM wanted to change up the story? Perhaps the Children of Zoretha have begun to bring chaos and destruction to the setting, in an effort to awaken their dormant parents. Perhaps the Hulks and their now matured Children have already colonized a different world and have now begun to invade the campaign setting. It is unfortunate that the original book did not provide the tools necessary in order to facilitate such stories.",

They are also capable of targeting an additional creature with their weaker version of Hypnotic Gaze.",

							"When compared to the other eight Elder Evils here, the Hulks of Zoretha could be considered the most underwhelming. One reason for this is that each individual Hulk is much weaker than many of the monsters out there. Even Soelma and Janwulf are higher in CR than an individual Hulk. Rather, the global threat posed by the Hulks' Blood Moon sign makes them a world-ending threat; additionally, the five Hulks are designed to be a challenge even for high level characters when fought all at once.",
							"The second reason for this is that there is so much missed potential for their story. The original Elder Evils book describes that the Hulks are part of an alien race that sent them to colonize the campaign setting; once they awaken and eradicate all sapient life on the planet, they will give birth to the \"Children of Zoretha\". Such children were not given statistics nor descriptions in the original book, as it is assumed that the players will defeat the Hulks before they have a chance to give birth to them.",
							"However, what if a DM wanted to change up the story? Perhaps the Children of Zoretha have begun to bring chaos and destruction to the setting, in an effort to awaken their dormant parents. Perhaps the Hulks and their now matured Children have already colonized a different world and have now begun to invade the campaign setting. It is unfortunate that the original book did not provide the tools necessary in order to facilitate such stories.",
							"Thus, I bring to you my take on the Children of Zoretha. They are simply my imagining of the concept, which I do not claim to have a definitive monopoly over or understanding of."

The party might be led to believe that the prospect of saving the world from evil, which she states as her goal on the journey, has filled her with a newfound purpose in life.

Even dormant, however, Father Llymic has ways of influencing the world around him. His tendrils worm through the surface of the ice, so that any who stand directly above him are affected by his corruption. In addition, he can project an image\u2014a shard of his dreaming mind\u2014into the world around him.",

Although the projection is slow of gait and never aggressive, it can never be caught. Whenever anyone draws too close, it steps out of sight, reappearing some distance away. If its targets refuse to follow it, the image grows agitated, appearing before them and silently screaming from a maw of razor-sharp ice fangs, then leaving to find other prey."

							"Corruptures come into being wherever the wilderness has been horribly befouled or natural laws have been repeatedly broken. In such places, nature reacts with a rent in existence that births a corrupture before closing, an embodiment of the cancerous damage to the world. Corruptures commonly appear in wilderness areas that have been poisoned or diseased, or that are heavily influenced by magic or another plane. Rarely they appear in civilized areas. Mundane defilement, such as razing a forest or draining a swamp, isn't enough to create a corrupture, but an arcane laboratory used for magical experimentation on creatures might well do so.",
							"A corrupture is a mindless hunter, driven by instinct to hunt down the nearest prey of fair size. It draws food and water directly through its skin, first dissolving flesh with its acid and then moving over the gooey remains. Corruptures are able to survive on plant matter for a short time but need meat at least once a week. They can feed on carrion if necessary, but they prefer fresh, fluid-filled prey.",
							"Corruptures have no gender and do not mate: They just get bigger. An undamaged corrupture with plenty to eat molts its outer flesh as it grows. This process takes a month of uninterrupted hibernation. After this time, the corrupture has an even more voracious appetite for several weeks. Larger, ancient corruptures begin to lose the ability to move under their own power. Such massive sacks of flesh can actually become stationary and starve.",

Pitted and slick with the black slime of the putrid amniotic fluid of its birth, it hangs above, always drifting away from the light of the sun and lurking overhead when the sun has fled. It has the appearance of a huge chunk of black stone, but from certain angles, it looks like a great hairless head, black eyes glassy and soulless.",

This rock is not uninhabited: Undead conjured from the darkest nightmares infest it. These horrors claim the craters for themselves, flitting through the shadows, ravenous for the energy of the living. The master of them all is the focus, an extension of Atropus's will.",

Coming of age is a brutal ritual: A pair of adolescents must undergo a hunt to bring down a large and dangerous creature. They hunt together, but only one can bring down the prey and earn adult status. The other is either killed by the rest of the tribe or flees into the wilderness in hopes of creating his own tribe\u2014few such individuals survive.",
											"Although rather unintelligent, whitespawn hunters value slave labor. They sometimes capture sentient beings to use as porters, entertainment, and food. Slaves rarely last more than a few months, succumbing to their masters' casual brutality and the landscape's bitter cold. Dead slaves are unceremoniously stripped and eaten by the tribe. Whitespawn hunters sometimes dominate whitespawn hordelings. The hunters despise their weak and inferior cousins and delight in bossing them around. However, they are just as apt to kill and eat hordelings as they are to command them.",
											"Whitespawn hunters are uninterested in diplomacy; they either slaughter or enslave anyone unable to stop them, or they avoid more powerful creatures. Tribes occasionally trade with other evil beings, notably orcs, but only when desperate. During these liaisons, they are happy to divulge the location of other whitespawn hunter tribes to their trading partners, hoping to send potential attackers against their competition.",
											"Unlike most spawn, whitespawn hunters do not especially venerate Tiamat. However, they do fear and respect her, and tribes leave offerings from every kill to appease her. The most elaborate altars to Tiamat boast the skull of a white dragon, with small items of treasure occasionally laid beneath the meat as additional offerings. Most hunters wear small icons of ivory crudely carved in their deity's image.",
											"Likewise, whitespawn hunters do not revere white dragons; they respect the creatures' power and majesty but also see them as competition for food. When times are tough, whitespawn hunters have no compunction about killing white dragons. Indeed, they consider such action a testament to Tiamat's desire to see the strongest triumph. At other times, a white dragon might rule an entire tribe of hunters\u2014as long as it is powerful enough to maintain command. The moment it shows any weakness, the tribe's strongest hunters (especially berserkers) challenge its rule.",

She created diverse and numerous creatures with the blood of chromatic dragons and sent forth these spawn to spread destruction and evil. This incursion of evil dragonblood creatures threatens the balance of the war and, by extension, the world.",

Today, Tiamat has the upper hand. It might well fall to the player characters to prevent her spawn from permanently tipping the Dragonfall War in favor of evil.",
						"Every spawn of Tiamat has some vestige of the power of the Queen of Evil Dragons in its blood. Many, though, are born not directly to her but to individual evil dragons throughout the world. Whether chosen by Tiamat herself or only by fickle chance, some chromatic dragon eggs hatch into the spawn described in this section. Usually a single egg is so touched, but occasionally an entire clutch produces spawn of Tiamat (which might not even be all the same kind). A given spawn is born only to a dragon that matches its color, which combined with the word \"spawn,\" forms part of its name. Blackspawn raiders and blackspawn stalkers, for example, are born only to black dragons. Although spawn first began to appear within clutches of dragon eggs, most of them breed true and now are rapidly multiplying.",

They mature much more quickly than true dragons, reaching adulthood in only a few years. Spawn of Tiamat usually congregate with other creatures, whether in packs of their kind or with like-minded individuals of other races, particularly evil dragons. Reports have surfaced recently of hobgoblin clerics and warlords gathering spawn of Tiamat and other evil dragons for a great battle.

It's apparent to anyone who spends much time with one that an inevitable would sacrifice an ally to fulfill its purpose without a second thought.",

When it discerns another transgression of the principle it is dedicated to, it has a new mission. Inevitables tend to stick out in a crowd while they're in observation mode, but they seem oblivious to the attention. Those in the know who hear about a 12-foot-tall, golden-armored statue roaming the countryside might seek out the inevitable and present a case, hoping it will take on the alleged transgressor. The decision is based on the idiosyncrasies of the inevitable's programming, so there's no guarantee.",

				"Based on the experience of myself and others when running certain monsters, I find that keeping track of auras (such as {@creature Gorguth|EdE}'s Aura of Annihilation and Death Gaze) is very tedious and easy to forget. This happens because such an aura typically takes when another creature starts (or ends) its turn within a certain range of the aura's origin. Especially when such auras have saving throws attached to them, they quickly start to bog down the game with dice rolling and number crunching.",
				"The issue I face is two-fold: first, official monsters already work this way, so for me to go against it could potentially be confusing to DMs that are already used to it. Second, as auras are constantly emanating, it makes sense that they take effect on every creatures' turns; other solutions contradict this logic by allowing creatures to pass through them without necessarily being affected.",
				"With that in mind, I still present to you this variant: rather than having an aura affect creatures at the start of their turns, have them affect creatures at the start of the aura emanator's turn. This may require some reflavoring - for example, a Negative Energy Aura would be flavored as a periodic burst of negative energy coming from an {@creature atropal|ToA}, rather than being a constant sphere around the atropal. However, this solution can drastically speed up your game; not to mention, your game being bogged down is probably even more immersion breaking than an aura that is ran using this variant."

								"When elder evils stir, the world groans; when they awaken, the world weeps. Buried in the deepest bowels of the Underdark, hidden in the farthest reaches of the multiverse, or lost in the gulfs between realities are terrible things that exist only to destroy or horribly remake creation. So mighty are these ancient beings that even the gods think twice about standing against them. Mortals who are aware of their existence viciously suppress that knowledge and destroy any who would serve such things. Even if an elder evil can be forced back to whence it came, its mere presence changes the world forever. In short, it is a campaign ender.",

From an undead world \"born\" at the moment of creation, to terrifying monstrosities that clawed their way out of the Abyss, to unthinkable entities from beyond the planes, these beings exemplify horrors that can destroy not just a kingdom but entire worlds or even existence itself.",
										"Most elder evils have been imprisoned by great heroes, deities, or other powerful beings who fear their release. Yet they are not so easily forgotten: Whispers of their existence seduce the mad and villainous, promising great power in exchange for release. Thus, each elder evil presented here has one or more servants, also described in detail.",
										"{@b Chapter 1. Evil Does Not Sleep:} This section provides suggestions for introducing an elder evil into the campaign as well as signs that bring the end times to your world. New cult features and malefic properties add horror and power to elder evils and their servants.",
										"{@b Chapter 2. Atropus:} This moonlike orb is the stillborn afterbirth of the world's creation, an undead entity that desires nothing less than the end of the entire multiverse.",
										"{@b Chapter 3. Father Llymic:} Although his body lies frozen in a prison of ice, the mind of this utterly alien being is glacially aware. His corrosive form slowly infects his surroundings, reaching gradually to make the world a part of himself. His corrupt Brood roams free, spreading evil in preparation for their master's awakening.",
										"{@b Chapter 4. Hulks of Zoretha:} Left behind in the wake of a world-shaking storm a century past, these enigmatic monoliths hold a secret known by only a few. The Hulks are the seeds of a monstrous colonization project, awaiting a signal from a parallel plane. Once it is received, they will animate to carve a path of destruction.",
										"{@b Chapter 5. Leviathan:} Leviathan is a creature of bestial intelligence whose enormous coils wrap the world. It sleeps in the deepest trenches of the seas, spawning tsunamis, whirlpools, and earthquakes as it restlessly shifts. Now mad cultists seek to wake the beast and submerge all the lands.",
										"{@b Chapter 6. Pandorym:} Pandorym is a doomsday weapon, an entity from beyond the multiverse. Ancient wizards summoned it as a deterrent to defend their empire from vengeful deities. However, the raging gods ended the kingdom's reign before it could release the weapon. Pandorym now lingers, its essence split and imprisoned, waiting for release\u2014and vengeance.",
										"{@b Chapter 7. Ragnorra:} Arising in a time before creation, Ragnorra is a force of perverted life that births monstrosities from her swollen body. The deities cast her into the sky, but she reappears as a blood-red comet every 500 years. Dreadful seed and falling stars produce monstrous offspring in worlds Ragnorra approaches\u2014and now she smashes into worlds to remake them directly.",
										"{@b Chapter 8. Sertrous:} Sertrous began as a demon, one of the obyriths\u2014a remnant demonic race shuddering toward extinction. With the rise of the tanar'ri, Sertrous was exiled from the Abyss and took the form of a monstrous serpent, granting vile powers to the yuan-ti in exchange for their service. Even though he was slain, Sertrous lingers in spirit and continues to corrupt the snake people. His followers, the Vanguard of Sertrous, employ intrigue and magic to gain influence and ultimately bring about the end of the world.",
										"{@b Chapter 9. The Worm that Walks:} This elder evil is the memory of a slain corporeal god. Its essence transferred itself to the worms and maggots that devoured the deity's corpse, forming a hideous but vaguely humanoid shape. The horror was sealed away in an obelisk by heroes of a previous age. It seeks ever to escape and eat its way to world domination, one writhing victim at a time.",
										"{@b Chapter 10. Zargon:} According to legend, Zargon cannot be killed unless his horn is severed from his body, and if his horn is not destroyed, he will inevitably return to claim it. The immortals could not discover a means of destroying his horn, and thus they entombed Zargon and a whole city of his mad worshipers in a place now lost to history."

										"{@b SPL 5:} Caira Xasten, driven mad with grief at the loss of her husband, vows revenge on the gods. Having heard wild rumors of the World Born Dead, she sends out her minions to steal a manuscript held in a vault beneath a cathedral in one of the largest cities in your setting (good choices include Sharn, Waterdeep, and the Free City of Greyhawk). Her minions succeed and snatch the book, leaving scores of priests dead. The church hires the party to find out who was behind the robbery and recover the tome. The party manages to attain the book, but not before Caira has a chance to learn its mysteries.",
										"{@b SPL 10 (Faint Sign):} The priests contact the party once more. Having deciphered the old tome, the clerics suspect whoever sought the book intends to summon the World Born Dead. The manuscript offers few details, and the clerics have been unable to elicit any concrete answers from their god. They do uncover the name of another tome: The {@item book of vile darkness}. They ask the characters to locate this book before their enemy uncovers it. The party must research and follow up on leads to find its resting place, all the while facing innumerable cultists who seek the same end. To make matters worse, the party hears reports from all over about how the dead have begun to rise from their graves.",
										"{@b SPL 15 (Moderate Sign):} Sensing an opportunity to make a decisive strike against his ancient enemy, Orcus dispatches his legions, led by a bodak named Gorguth, to invade Demogorgon's layer, the Gaping Maw. This strike plunges the Abyss into widespread war, with demon lords and princes lining up against one another to settle old scores. The Dark Eight of the Nine Hells perceive this infighting as a weakness and for the first time mount a successful invasion into the Infinite Layers of the Abyss. During the interplanar wars, Gorguth forswears his allegiance to Orcus and leads his undead armies into the Material Plane through a {@spell gate} created by cultists in the service of Atropus.",
										"Meanwhile, Caira recovers the {@item book of vile darkness} and learns that the elder evil will come if a tragedy of terrible and widespread death were to occur. She researches the {@spell apocalypse from the sky|EdE} spell, during which time she sends out her minions to collect a sample of angel tears she intends to use to complete the casting of the spell. The party might be drawn into the fighting on the planes, join the battle against Gorguth, or follow up their leads about Caira.",
										"{@b SPL 17 (Strong Sign):} The undead outnumber the living, spreading like a cancer. Gorguth's armies beat back the defenders, filling their depleted ranks by turning their fallen adversaries into undead. Gorguth marches toward the metropolis where he intends to greet the elder evil when it arrives. Meanwhile, Caira completes her research and begins the daylong casting from her hidden base beneath the city. From one of her captured minions or another ally they met along the way, the party learns of her horrible plan and must decide whether they will stand against the fast-approaching undead army or seek out the ur-priest in the hope of halting her fell magic.",
										"{@b SPL 20 (Overwhelming Sign):} If the party stops Caira, it is a short-lived victory, for Gorguth approaches, and his hordes of demons and undead spill into the city, spreading death and destruction throughout. Alternatively, if the party faced Gorguth and defeated it, Caira completes the spell and bathes everything in a 100-mile radius with fiery death, killing tens of thousands. This calamity is enough to awaken Atropus, and the moonlet begins to descend toward the planet. Surviving spellcasters cast {@spell gate} spells to transport people to the Plane of Shadow, trying to save as many as they can, leaving the party as the world's last chance to stop Atropus. They must travel to the moonlet, brave the void, and find and defeat the aspect of Atropus before the moonlet reaches the planet's surface."

The oldest mentions of this entity date back to the Age of Demons, marking Atropus's appearance during the climactic sacrifice of the couatls in their attempt to rid their world of the demons and force them to their native plane. In the millennia that followed, astronomers have commented on the passage of an anomalous comet that seems to appear whenever Dolurrh, Realm of the Dead, is coterminous with the Material Plane. Some theorize this comet is in fact Atropus of legend, and one day the World Born Dead will visit Eberron again.",

If mortals knew the evil far above their heads, they would quake in their boots and seek refuge in the bowels of the earth. Indeed, only the Argonnessen dragons know what doom awaits them all, for they have identified a celestial object whose appearance occurred at the same time that Cyre became the Mournland. It is an odd thing moving through the Ring of Siberys. Some suspect magical manifestation, maybe a planar anomaly, but a few know the truth, and they do their best to push such thoughts from their minds, lest they draw its attention by dwelling on what many believe is the inevitable end of the world."

They agree that Atropus was spawned when Ao created the first gods, but where they differ is in how Atropus was formed. Some claim the elder evil gained awareness from the divine amniotic fluid surrounding the first god of death, while others claim Atropus was the last god Ao created, but it was stillborn. Atropus has never come close to Faerûn, but those aware of it are ever watchful of the heavens, waiting for the day when the moonlet circles the tapestry of night.",
										"The moonlet is one of the drifting bodies forming the ring around the dull gray planet known as Glyth, one of the Five Wanderers that do not follow the ordinary paths of the stars. Little do the mortals of Faerûn realize the cataclysm affecting this distant world. Drawn by the widespread death and destruction meted out by mind flayer overlords, Atropus drew close, masking its approach behind the belt of debris forming the ring around the planet. While the illithids waged their interminable wars against the native humanoids, Atropus descended and wiped out all life, leaving Glyth an empty husk. Now Atropus turns its attention to Faerûn and begins its slide toward a world ripe for the taking",
										"Instead of constraining Atropus to be a leftover creation of the overgod Ao, a DM may wish to relate Atropus to Ao in a more equal manner, or they may wish to remove Ao from the setting altogether. In the latter case, use the default lore provided in the Background section to explain Atropus's origins."

In this case, the Restless Dead sign could represent Atropus drawing nearer to a given plane, intensifying until Atropus is able to enter the plane.",
										"The default Sign of Apocalypse for Atropus is certainly a major effect in your campaign world, but some may find it unsatisfying that the Sign is a passive effect that is simply a byproduct of Atropus's approach. If you wish to make Atropus feel more like an active threat, allow more powerful undead in service to Atropus to descend from the moonlet to your campaign setting. For example, you can take advantage of Atropus's connection to Atropals to make them effective heralds of the moonlet's approach. As stillborn creatures from the Negative Energy plane, atropals also serve as effective heralds in planar campaigns, acting as forerunners for the much larger threat to come.",
										"You can also consider other threats to act as villains in anticipation of Atropus's arrival. For example, while the original outline suggests that Orcus be involved in an interplanar war, you may wish for Orcus himself to beckon Atropus's arrival. In this case, the Bleak General might be a loyal servant of Orcus, rather than betraying him in favor of Atropus. Another villains include Acererak, Lady Illmarrow (and the Order of the Emerald Claw), an aspiring lich or mummy lord, a god of undeath, or a fallen angel or undead celestial. Perhaps even the Worm That Walks (chapter 9) has taken an interest in Atropus, and has decided to ally with the World Born Dead so that it may rule the dead world that Atropus leaves behind.",
										"Additionally, feel free to alter the details as to how Atropus is summoned. The suggested campaign outline gives two ways for Atropus to be summoned: the {@spell apocalypse from the sky|EdE} spell, obtained through the {@item book of vile darkness}, or the massacre of a major city by demonic forces. Below are additional possibilities for how Atropus might be summoned:",
										{
											"type": "list",
											"items": [
												"Perhaps a certain artifact or magical object must be destroyed in order to summon Atropus. For example, maybe the {@item book of exalted deeds} can be temporarily destroyed using a {@item talisman of ultimate evil}, the act of which awakens Atropus and draws it towards the setting. Alternatively, perhaps a dimensional seal or a planar barrier prevents Atropus from entering a given plane or approaching a given planet, and if destroyed, the World Born Dead will be free to approach and annihilate it.",
												"In Eberron, an eldritch machine, as detailed in {@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW}, may be used to channel large amounts of negative energy in order to cause mass death, or it may simply be used as a homing beacon that entices Atropus to approach the setting.",
												"In a planar setting, cultists of the World Born Dead might perform a ritual to break down the barriers that separate the planes, allowing Atropus to pass through a large planar portal into the target plane.",
												"In a Spelljammer campaign, Atropus might be on a set path through the cosmos. If it isn't stopped in time, Atropus might destroy a major planetary hub or a capital of a large civilization."
											]
										},
										"Lastly, feel free to use the {@creature Aspect of Atropus|EdE} in new and creative ways. For example, perhaps cultists seek to summon the Aspect of Atropus directly to their world; if they succeed, the aspect will annihilate them and every other creature in the setting. Perhaps a villain seeks to take advantage of the aspect for their own gain. If they absorb or take control of the aspect somehow, they may gain control of the moonlet, or their consciousness might be merged with the World Born Dead itself. Any villain will recognize that the World Born Dead holds the ultimate power over death and undeath, and that if this can be taken advantage of, they will be unstoppable."

The vast and varied planes of existence fascinated them, yet they still sought farther. The most powerful among them wanted to know what lay beyond the planes. As part of their work, the elves constructed a great many gates and portals to other worlds and planes of existence. In attempting to peer beyond the veils of infinity, they finally built their greatest creation: the Vast Gate, designed to pierce the boundaries of the planes. What they found destroyed them.",

Even as the elves tried to close the gate, strange things slipped through, forever tying the world to the Far Realm.

Some died unnatural deaths, while others merely ceased to function, going into a sort of dormancy until conditions would be right for them to thrive. One such entity seemed to have an aversion to light. Although it was paralyzed, some aspect of this creature remained able to send illusory projections, beckoning the unwary to visit his unmoving form.

The elves moved him to a mountaintop, where his chill would not harm anyone and the light of the sun might keep him dormant forever. The few remaining caretaker elves eventually died, and Father Llymic was forgotten.",

Not many have ever seen the Hulks, and fewer still have lived to pass on the tale of five stone monoliths hidden deep within the mountainous snow-capped north. Those who know of the Hulks have only read of them in dusty ancient scrolls, and the barely comprehensible tidings contained therein are usually discounted as superstitious nonsense, mad ramblings, or at best archaic and obsolete information.",

These accounts reveal that the Hulks have existed far longer than the reach of recorded memory, even that of the elves. They are too old to have been carved by any civilization known to mortal scholarship, and no mythology hints at their creation being attributed to any god.",
								"The scholars most knowledgeable about the Hulks of Zoretha recognize that the horror of the Hulks is no mere superstitious nonsense. Far from being simple carvings from some primeval civilization, the Hulks of Zoretha radiate some kind of nightmare-inducing power. They are horrifying to all who look upon them, sometimes to the point of driving even servants of the gods mad. Those thus afflicted are sometimes able to reveal more information about the Hulks of Zoretha through their nightmares than history alone could ever disclose.",
								"A small number of living mortals in the world have seen the Hulks in person or hold copies of recent accounts of such visits. These people are either too mad to publish their experiences or too fearful for the world if the existence of the Hulks becomes common knowledge. Visitors to the Hulks of Zoretha attest to the presence of mad cults worshiping the Hulks as gods. These cults believe that the monoliths fell from the sky before the dawn of mortals and that they will one day awaken and purify the world of all sickness and filth.",

Though I Weep's insane ramblings are difficult to decipher, they indicate that through evaluation of the nightmares of hundreds of different beings, he was able to discern the Hulks' true purpose in this world: The Hulks are forerunners of alien colonization from a place called Zoretha.

Near the end of the journey, the party encounters Janwulf the Soulbiter and his followers. Janwulf is familiar with Nilaenish and acts as if she has betrayed him somehow.

										"When compared to the other eight Elder Evils here, the Hulks of Zoretha could be considered the most underwhelming. One reason for this is that each individual Hulk is much weaker than many of the monsters out there. Even Soelma and Janwulf are higher in CR than an individual Hulk. Rather, the global threat posed by the Hulks' Blood Moon sign makes them a world-ending threat; additionally, the five Hulks are designed to be a challenge even for high level characters when fought all at once.",
										"The second reason for this is that there is so much missed potential for their story. The original Elder Evils book describes that the Hulks are part of an alien race that sent them to colonize the campaign setting; once they awaken and eradicate all sapient life on the planet, they will give birth to the \"Children of Zoretha\". Such children were not given statistics nor descriptions in the original book, as it is assumed that the players will defeat the Hulks before they have a chance to give birth to them.",
										"However, what if a DM wanted to change up the story? Perhaps the Children of Zoretha have begun to bring chaos and destruction to the setting, in an effort to awaken their dormant parents. Perhaps the Hulks and their now matured Children have already colonized a different world and have now begun to invade the campaign setting. It is unfortunate that the original book did not provide the tools necessary in order to facilitate such stories.",
										"As mentioned, the Hulks of Zoretha are underwhelming because they are required to individually be weak in order to be a group encounter for high level players. Thus, DMs that feel the Hulks are boring as a group may run them as one colossal Elder Evil that I dubbed the \"Titan of Zoretha\".",
										"A five-headed monolith big enough to tackle a tarrasque, the Titan of Zoretha can be used as a replacement of the five Hulks in a standard campaign. However, if a DM makes the Hulks and Children of Zoretha non-unique (i.e. a reoccuring monster type throughout the campaign), the Titan of Zoretha would instead be used as their leader. This way, the aliens of Zoretha can be used as an entire faction of enemies, rather than relying on cultists and the Hulks' Blood Moon sign to create conflict throughout the campaign.",
										"Thus, I included statistics for the Children of Zoretha (both {@creature child of zoretha (female)|EdE|Females} and {@creature child of zoretha (male)|EdE|Males}) and the variant {@creature Titan of Zoretha|EdE} in this conversion.

Throughout the campaign, more and more aberrations might threaten the world in preparation for the Hulks' awakening.",
												"Elaborate upon the mysterious place called Zoretha. In a Spelljammer campaign, perhaps Zoretha is a distant crystal sphere that the other denizens of Zoretha call home. In a planar campaign, perhaps Zoretha is a new plane of existence from outside the Great Wheel, or it is a small crevasse between two planes that has been undetected by mortal civilization.",
												"Change the motivation of the Hulks as you see fit. As alien colonizers, the Hulks might seek to enslave the mortal races instead, using what is left of civlization when they awaken to construct a new society for their Children to live in. Or perhaps the Hulks seek to open a portal to Zoretha, allowing the rest of their kind to flood into their new colony. You can also change the motivations of the Cult of Zoretha. Perhaps they can perform sacrificial rituals in order to create or summon the Children of Zoretha, or maybe their desire to spread madness to all has allowed them to create the Blood Moon sign themselves."

The dark enticement of the chance to slay deities called to the Material Plane a sentient singularity of scarcely fathomable power and unrelenting destructiveness.",

										"{@b SPL 15 (Moderate Sign):} The characters discover that the being they seek is a misguided agent of supreme law who does not view its objective as an evil or foolish act.",
										"Meanwhile, the nocturnal glyphs become more prevalent and numerous, as the bonds connecting the Material Plane to other planes continue to weaken. Summoned creatures do not automatically return home, and advanced spellcasters find that their methods of teleportation have become somewhat unreliable.",
										"{@b SPL 17 (Strong Sign):} The party learns the identity of both the rogue agent and the being it wishes to release. A kolyarut known as Obligatum VII believes it is bound by law to free the imprisoned Pandorym. The characters might have run across the creature earlier but not realized that it was their adversary.",

Anyone that wields all of these artifacts would instantly discover the location of Pandorym's mind (or body), making them highly desirable for Obligatum VII and any other faction out there.",
												"Add additional restrictions as to how Pandorym's mind can be freed. By default, the crystalline prison can be attacked via any adamantine or magical weapon, and is protected mostly by its secret location and hostile guardians. However, you may wish to create a specific weapon, spell, or other object or process that acts as the only way to destroy the prison. Whatever the requirement is, the story would involve Obligatum's quest to satisfy it, as well as the party's attempts to stop it from succeeding.",

While Pandorym's sphere of annihilation-esque body normally can't be controlled, perhaps a special talisman was created by its summoners in order to move it to its current hiding place. With this talisman, any entity or faction could use Pandorym's body as an unstoppable weapon, assuming that they can find the body in the first place. Maybe Obligatum itself seeks Pandorym's body so that it may destroy the crystalline prison that houses Pandorym's mind, allowing Pandorym to become whole again much sooner than anticipated."

								"The gods would have mortals believe that in the beginning, they created the world. That they helped shape the world is not in dispute, but they were far from the first to cast their influence across the Material Plane. The aboleths lived in the primeval depths before the first deity wrought life from primal clay. The elemental races established vast multiplanar empires long before the first priest offered prayers from a crude stone altar. And in the roiling deep of the Abyss, demons had already conquered entire planes before the advent of intelligent life on the Material Plane. Most powerful among these ancient demons were the obyrith lords.",
								"Led by the Queen of Chaos, the obyriths waged murder against the elemental Wind Dukes of Aaqa. Those who refused to join the Queen were punished and imprisoned. Obox-ob, then the Prince of Demons, withstood her call. In a great war, the Queen defeated Obox-ob and crowned her consort, Miska the Wolf Spider, the new Prince of Demons. Yet when the Queen's legions were defeated on the Fields of Pesh, it was ironically the obyrith lords she had cast out or imprisoned who survived.",
								"One such obyrith lord was Sertrous, a minor demon lord associated at the time with parasites and crawling things. Ever rebellious, Sertrous slew every demon that came to his Abyssal lair to recruit him to the Queen's cause. He had little defense against the Queen herself, who quickly grew tired of his insubordination, destroyed his body, and cast his essence into the gulf between planes as one might cast aside a carcass. Yet this did not spell Sertrous's doom. As his essence passed through the Material Plane, Sertrous made a desperate grab at an anchor to prevent his passage into the void beyond. All he found was a lowly serpent, wallowing in the mire of a primeval fen.",
								"For untold centuries, Sertrous lived as a serpent. At first, he was confined to that serpent's body. As he healed, his essence transformed the serpent into a new physicality that took on the madness of his previous demonic form. Yet he retained serpentine features\u2014partially as a disguise if agents of the Queen encounter him. Sertrous watched from his fen as the mortal races grew civilized, established their own empires, and raised temples to honor the gods. Sertrous grew jealous of their prosperity and coveted the devotion mortals heaped upon the gods. And so he waged war on them, plaguing these first nations with armies of serpents and monsters from the fen.",
								"When the beleaguered mortals called upon one of their deity's most powerful minions, the solar Avamerin, Sertrous claimed his first and greatest victory. Avamerin led a great army into the fen to destroy Sertrous. The obyrith's minions were evenly matched with the angel's, and in the end only the obyrith and the angel survived to face one another. The battle was intense, but in the end the solar defeated the serpent. As Avamerin raised his sword and prepared to strike the killing blow, Sertrous asked him a simple question: \"Why serve your lord when his playthings can gain the same strength of power through their own will?\" Avamerin struck then, slaying Sertrous. He returned to civilization with the obyrith's head as proof of his triumph and spoke to the nation's priests of the demon's foolish words.",
								"Yet in spreading these words, Avamerin unwittingly released a great secret. Scholars and priests puzzled over Sertrous's dying words and made an incredible discovery: One need not worship a god to gain the power of divine magic. Rather than worship a god, a cleric could worship an ideal and gain the same reward. He could worship the mountains, or the sky, or the act of war, or himself. He could even worship a slain obyrith lord. Avamerin saw this plague of godless priests thrive and was powerless to stop it. The solar realized his error, and when he confessed to his lord, he was stripped of his rank and reduced to a planetar's status.",
								"Enraged, Avamerin cast aside his servitude and stole Sertrous's head, claiming that the dead demon was wiser than the gods. The gods recoiled and took from Avamerin his beauty. If he would ascribe such value to a serpent's words, he would be one with them. The gods gave him the visage of a snake and banished him from heaven. Yet the damage had been done. The angel became the first heretic, and he devoted the rest of his existence to serving the one who had opened his eyes. In time, the devotion of Avamerin and those he recruited to his Vanguard would be enough to restore Sertrous to life and prove what the fallen angel had come to believe was the truth beyond the lies of faith."

The Vanguard was defeated, but its teachings proved immortal. Every few hundred years, a new zealot takes up the cause and leads a new army on the march.",

He coveted their cities, their accomplishments, and most of all the adoration the citizens heaped upon the gods. Sertrous wanted to be worshiped and held in awe, and the only way he could accomplish this was through conquest. He was slain by the angel Avamerin, who, it is rumored, later fell victim to the Vanguard and was himself slain.",
								"Sertrous's true reasons for waging war on the Material Plane are more than mere jealousy. He wishes to return to the Abyss and reclaim his realm now that the time of the Queen of Chaos is past. Although he is dead, his spirit persists both in his severed head and in the rebellious will of Avamerin, who serves as the leader of the Vanguard in Sertrous's absence. With each war, the souls of those who die in the Vanguard's service are drawn into the Abyss to await their master's return, while at the same time the armies and resources of his Material Plane enemies are depleted. When his army of slithering petitioners in the Abyss is great enough, he shall return to life and reclaim his throne as a demon lord."

This name holds dreadful import not because of any remembered atrocity attributed to his name, but because of the things serving him still. His minions are numerous, ranging from grotesque undead to hideous aberrations. It is these servants mortals have come to revile, and they extend their loathing to the Worm that Walks for his part in bringing them into being.",
								"Scholars of forbidden lore claim that Kyuss walked the earth in an ancient era, long before the oldest kingdoms of the modern day. This time was one of great evil, when humanity dabbled with the blasphemous arts and served the dark gods. Kyuss was either a mortal necromancer of considerable talent or an evil god's ranking priest.",
								"The most common theory claims that Kyuss was so wicked even his decadent society exiled him, casting him out because he dabbled in forbidden arts and spoke ominous prophecies of an impending final age. Rather than languishing as an outcast, he became a prophet and drew to him followers who clamored to hear his grim words. They saw him as the gods' servant, if not a god in his own right, and believed it they curried his favor, he would shelter them from the horrific age he promised would come.",
								"Kyuss discovered the ruins of a dead civilization. The structures that remained bore many strange writings, depictions of human sacrifice, and six-armed tyrants ruling over all. Kyuss claimed this site for his own and commanded his people to rebuild the city from the wreckage.",
								"Although he ruled as god and king, the disturbing visions and his own discontentment urged him to seek greater power, to find some way to transcend the mortal flesh and become more than a man, to become a true god. His path was clear when his followers discovered ancient metal plates, which held terrible secrets but also confirmed every prophetic word he had spoken.",
								"Through these inscriptions, he discovered the incantation to let him transcend mortality at a terrible price\u2014the lives of his congregation. For this prophet, no price was too high, and on one bloody night he instructed his priests to round up the followers and slaughter them all. When they finished, Kyuss murdered the murderers. With the blood of thousands staining his hands, he turned to the great obelisk his servants had pulled from the earth and intoned the words to begin his transformation. When he was finished, he stepped into the stone, fusing his essence with the foul rock, gaining and losing his divinity in one moment. He was neither mortal nor god\u2014he was something far worse."

When Asmodeus and his allies seized the Nine Hells, they purged the plane of the baatorians, enslaving them and destroying their lords. Asmodeus butchered most himself, but Zargon was resilient to the worst attacks.

Vanessa flees, alone, and finds the city, where she is captured and taught the deeper secrets of Zargon.",

The Faceless Lord learns that Zargon is behind the upheaval and decides to forge an alliance with the elder evil to work toward the same goal\u2014widespread destruction.

Rather than confront the cult, they kill many people and fabricate evidence to implicate the cult of Juiblex. The characters are called to investigate. They learn of the plot, but also the identities of the true culprits.",
										"{@b SPL 15 (Strong Sign):} Dorn and his fellow cultists arrive at the ziggurat, where he meets Vanessa. She seduces him and convinces him to join her in a coup to take control of the cult of Zargon. Dorn slays his own father, spilling his blood onto Zargon's horn. This act of treachery speeds Zargon's rebirth, and the world shudders with even more violent weather.",

The party must play the groups against one another to learn about the force behind the storms, the threat Zargon poses, and the location of the fabled lost city.",

								"It is telling that the origins of the Dark God are buried beneath layers of secrecy. All faiths oppose the cults who serve He of Eternal Darkness, and to whisper his name is tantamount to blasphemy. The fear Tharizdun evokes and the intensity of his opposition are all well-founded since even the gods themselves, good and evil alike, share this trepidation. The reason is simple: The Ebon God wants nothing more than to unravel the nature of reality, to undo all the works of gods and mortals, to shatter the planes, and dissolve all things to their fundamental natures. Tharizdun is an uncaring force of destruction, motivated by an inexplicable need to eradicate all things, himself included.",
								"Since Tharizdun works always to bring ruin, the gods set aside their differences and sealed the dreadful power away, holding him in stasis so his malign will and countless servants could no longer threaten the balance of the cosmos. And though the gods returned to squabbling soon after his imprisonment eons ago, they remain united in their distaste and fear of their ancient enemy and, to this day, they are all committed to ensuring he remains safely tucked away beyond the reach of misguided fools. That the Dark God remains sealed away in a prison plane in some forgotten corner of the multiverse, though, is no consolation. The divine seals may contain him, but Tharizdun can extend his malign will beyond them, caressing the minds of his servants and impelling them to do his bidding. Assuming the guise of the Elder Elemental Eye, he has accumulated numerous disturbing cults that swear their allegiance to the multifaceted nature of their insane master, fighting each other as much as they move toward their unholy mission of releasing a power whose fullness and wickedness they only dimly realize.",
								"Champions of the various gods and agencies remain vigilant against the legions of the Elder Elemental Eye, by sacking their temples, raiding their redoubts, and executing cultists wherever they find them, but few realize the true breadth of Tharizdun's power. A small body of scholars and sages believes that Tharizdun's greatest servants are the elder evils themselves. So while the courageous heroes fight Tharizdun's minions, the Dark God compels the elder evils to stir and awaken so that they may ravage the world and weaken its gods. Tharizdun hopes that when he finally weakens the wards holding him, he will emerge unopposed.",
								"While various elder evils may or may not respond to the summons of the Dark God, Tharizdun's chief creation, an abomination named Shothragot, awoke in the cyclopean depths of the earth, far below the mines of a temple devoted to the Elder Elemental Eye. Weak and nearly powerless after years of undisturbed slumber, it siphons power from the prayers of the unwitting servants above, biding its time until it gains the strength it needs to set in motion the final events that would see its master free.",
								"While having an awakened elder evil is terrifying to conceive by itself, Shothragot is a special case, for this dreadful horror's origins trace back to the Invoked Devastation and the Rain of Colorless Fire, when Tharizdun's servants summoned forth his avatar for the last time. Whether or not its appearance compelled the use of appalling magic that brought death and devastation to hundreds of thousands is a matter of debate, but what is known is that almost as fast as the avatar appeared, so too did he vanish after the wrought destruction. Most scholars suspect the avatar was destroyed in the conflagration, but in truth, it was weakened, dreadfully so, and the powerful energies unleashed left the avatar crippled. Thus it fled into the bowels of the earth, where it waited.",
								"Shothragot might have laid in wait forever, but its slumber was disturbed when a most unfortunate happenstance occurred. A band of adventurers, whose purpose was to destroy a cult of the Elder Elemental Eye infesting the mines around a fortress of wickedness, found their own deaths, nearly to the man. When a fleeing survivor became lost and stumbled into the elder evil crèche, Shothragot awoke, seized the mortal, and refashioned him using the last spark of divine essence to make him his principle servant. With his new agent in the field and with the prayers dedicated to the Elder Elemental Eye infusing him with power, the elder evil now swells with power and is nearly ready to reveal itself and bring about the release of its beloved master."

What it does know is that it has many enemies arrayed against it, and so it is careful not to reveal itself until such time that it is strong enough to smash those who stand against it.",
								"Its need for joining Tharizdun fills its thoughts, but it has no clear understanding of how it should go about achieving this end.

From time to time, a face swims into its consciousness, and when it appears, it compels its minions to seek out and destroy these individuals, although even it knows not why. In truth, it is Tharizdun himself who dispatches these messages to remove obstacles that would prevent Shothragot from completing its mission.",

Also present are several insane cultists who plunder the place in search of something.",
										"At the top of the tower, the cultists find what they're looking for: a black gem, identical to the one the party found earlier in the dungeon. A thrilling fight takes place, but before the party can slay all the villains, one slips away with the gem in hand.",
										"{@b SPL 9 (Faint Sign):} After weeks of quiet, when life just starts to return to normal, a queer fiery glyph appears in the sky. Attempts to reach it through magic utterly fail; it always seems to move just out of reach. No one seems to know what it signifies, but certain types of spells are becoming harder to cast.",
										"Tharizdun, peering into the future, senses the characters are a dire threat, and so it dispatches a dream to Shothragot, who in turn sends its greatest minion, {@creature Giorge Forsworn|EdE}, to attend to them. The mortal hunter plays a cat-and-mouse game, murdering those closest to the characters first and then picking off the heroes one at a time.",
										"{@b SPL 12 (Moderate Sign):} As the sign in the sky intensifies, the greatest minds in the lands set to unravel the mystery of its appearance. A wide range of theories abound, but {@creature Jallarzi Sallavarian|EdE}, a powerful archmage and member of the Circle of Eight (or some other arcane group), is close and she believes the glyph signifies a dire threat to the world, suspecting it may have something to do with Tharizdun. Well-acquainted with the history of the Dark God, she sets out for the Sea of Dust to find the Forgotten City in the hopes of unraveling the mystery of the glyph.",
										"When she doesn't return, the remaining members of the Circle of Eight, who work to undo the expanding sign, hire the adventurers to track the missing wizard. Enduring a long and perilous journey and exploring the haunted ruins of the ancient city, the adventurers learn the history of the avatar, but not before being confronted by the warped Jallarzi, who, through dabbling with dangerous magic, has become a twisted creature of the Dark God.",
										"{@b SPL 15 (Strong Sign):} Armed with the information uncovered in the Forgotten City and burdened with the horrible fate of an esteemed member of the Circle, the adventurers return to the Circle of Eight, only to find that the sign has grown even stronger. Cross-referencing their information with that of the powerful wizards, Mordenkainen suggests the heroes explore former strongholds of Tharizdun's cultists to see if they can learn of some way to stop the impending apocalypse. The party journies to the Temple of Elemental Evil, the Crater Ridge Mines, and other locations, each site revealing a bit more about the enemy they face.",
										"{@b SPL 18 (Overwhelming Sign):} Just as the heroes are exploring the final known site, the caldera formed by the Crater Ridge explodes, and amidst the debris and destruction rises a massive globe of dripping black corruption. As it rises, the sign in the heavens expands until it stretches from one horizon to the next. Horrific insane creatures come and go from the bulk, emerging from orifices that pierce its glistening hide.",
										"The sign's power prevents the Circle of Eight from arriving here quickly, so it falls to the party to journey inside this floating abomination and destroy the essence that lurks within. Should they fail, Shothragot will surely unlock the wards that seal Tharizdun and draw forth the gods in a climactic battle that will leave the world forever after changed."

Unfortunately, Tharizdun's minions, of which there are many beneath Eberron, seek to release their dark lord and busily create a weapon that will not only breach the Gatekeeper wards that keep them underground but also bridge the gulf between planes and release their dreadful master.

										"Few names strike as much fear as the dreaded Tharizdun. The Dark God has many names, looming large in the minds of every sentient race to walk the Material Plane. He is known as the Patient One, He of Eternal Darkness, while others call him the Elder Elemental Eye, the Ebon God, or by any of countless other appellations. All of these are masks\u2014facades to conceal utter malevolence and evil. A god so powerful and so destructive, his mere existence compelled the gods of good and evil to set aside their differences and lock him away for all time. This is Tharizdun, the lord of entropy, the force of decay and destruction in the multiverse. He is the god of madness, the father of endings, and to some, he is the sire of elder evils.",
										"In spite of the gods' efforts to contain this malign entity, Tharizdun's touch has not been far from mortal minds. In their dreams, their fantasies, their feverish thoughts, he whispers unspeakable secrets, driving mad those who would listen, seducing them with promises of power, wealth, the fulfillment of their lust, vengeance, and anything else he can to fill their souls with an unquenchable thirst to serve his awful will. He puts before his servants one dreadful task. He demands freedom\u2014release from the hateful bonds that contain him in the far-flung prison deep inside the gloomiest depths of the Ethereal Plane. It is a task many have promised to fulfill but none have achieved, for the enemies of the Dark God are many and varied, drawn to oppose the certain destruction his release threatens. So it is that history is littered with corpses of Tharizdun's failed servants, of bold cultists cast down, and of entire civilizations brought to ruin for their allegiance to this foul master. To many, it seems Tharizdun is a tired threat, an old menace easily thwarted and one not worth committing the resources and heroes to defeat, for too often his minions find defeat. While some still remain committed to being vigilant against Tharizdun's endless legions, the cancer spreads and complacency blooms in the hearts of those that matter. It is but a matter of time before the world becomes too soft\u2014too weak\u2014to oppose him and his children, and that time is now.",
										"Deep beneath a forlorn volcano, long dormant but active with the servants of the Elder Elemental Eye, lays a dreadful thing\u2014a fragment of He of Eternal Darkness brought low ages ago by powerful magic. For centuries, the abomination has waited, growing fat on the prayers of those mortal above that gave their lives and those of their sacrifices to honor their insane master. Never content with such petty supplications, the entity divided its minions into factions and turned them against one another, compelling them to fight and murder, to harvest the souls of their brethren in evil. Each new death fed the elder evil, awakening a dire intelligence and a grim awareness until it took a name and found its purpose. It became Shothragot, the Herald of Tharizdun and the key to unlock the dread prison.",
										"As it stirred and trembled, it called upon awful servants to slaughter those remaining enemies, to winnow the ranks of those divine servants who would stand against it as it blossomed into the fullness of its horrid form. It assumed control over the scattered cultists, compelling them to seek out the keys that would unlock the dark god's prison, to find the 333 Gems of Tharizdun and return them to it so the Herald might consume them and grow powerful on their energies. For eight long years, the Herald feasted, growing fat on the burgeoning wickedness, greedily swallowing the stones as quickly as they arrived. The last gemstone devoured, Shothragot is ready to seek out its dread master. It tears free from its hidden redoubt and drifts into the heavens to make its final journey."

Fighting the elder evil itself is impossible since it is too big and too resilient to be destroyed from outside. Instead, the heroes must journey inside the elder evil, seek out its essence, and destroy it.",
										"A number of complications combine to make this task extraordinarily difficult. First, there's the matter of reaching the elder evil. Certainly, characters of this level should have means to reach the mass by means of a {@spell fly} spell, but note that so long as the glyph continues to burn in the heavens, teleportation spells automatically fail. Once the characters reach the elder evil, they have to find a way inside.",
										"Within, the player characters learn there is no way to reach the essence of Shothragot due to a sealed portal that, thanks to the glyph, no longer functions and blocks the passage. Diminishing the glyph is possible if the characters destroy all of the {@item Gem of Tharizdun|EdE|Gems of Tharizdun} (see area 4). This causes the glyph to recede and gives the party the chance to jump through the portal at area 6 to face the essence in area 22. Unfortunately, weakening the glyph also enables the elder evil to slip free from the Material Plane. Once there, the party must overcome the essence before it reaches Tharizdun's prison plane.",
										"A better solution is to find the {@item torch of revealing|EdE} and the {@item incense of dreaming|EdE} (found in area 18).

												"Undoubtedly, the player characters as wellas countless others, have felt the sign intensify, catching sight of its manifestation, first in subtle ways, but growing more powerful as Shothragot grows in power. The Herald's particular sign manifests as the Seal of Binding, a strange glyph that spreads across the heavens to interfere with conjuration magic. For details on the sign's full effects, see page 2 of this document. At the start of The Essence of Evil, Shothragot's sign is at Overwhelming strength. If you intend to run this adventure as the conclusion of your campaign, consider revealing the sign earlier to signal the approaching doom.",
												"Since noticing something is wrong is unavoidable, the player characters should have plenty of opportunity to research the sign's implications and associations and perhaps learn something more of Tharizdun in the process. Regardless of the party's preparations, the full weight of the threat reveals itself when Shothragot tears free from the Crater Ridge Mines and drifts into the sky toward the glyph burning in the heavens. Whatever the thing is, it aims to reach the fiery sign, and who can say what will happen when it reaches it?"

Thus the elder evil hovers until its servant finds the courage to do as he is bid.",

Demons, elementals, and corrupted abominations have burrowed into its form, some to worship it, others to accompany it as it makes its passage into the Ethereal Plane. If the elder evil cares, it shows no sign and seems content to let the parasites exist for now."
