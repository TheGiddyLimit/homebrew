One by one, the heroes fell, the flesh of their bodies flung up in the orgy of violence, trailing ropes of dark blood to the sounds of their screams. It was too much for the ranger named Giorge, and he set aside his courage and fled into the black tunnels.",

He ran for what might have been minutes but felt like days and in his panic, he lost track of where he was, losing himself in the bleak corridors and the rusting rails of the accursed mines. When his breath came in hitches and the pain in his side forced him to stop, he collapsed, tears pouring from his eyes, little sobs escaping from his dry and cracked lips. He knew he would die. The sounds of his pursuers were close. Too close.",

He was about to stand\u2014to make his final desperate attempt to kill his foes\u2014when something wet and black and awful curled around his ankle.

Giorge's sudden arrival and the approach of more fishfolk hunters caused the great horror to awaken and snatch Giorge, plunging the mortal into the thickened waters contaminated by its rot. Beneath the churning surface, the entity known as Shothragot infested Giorge's mind, rent his spirit, and seized his body, transforming it into something else entirely.",

But the thing in the pool was not through with its first disciple.",

Giorge, then, is an extension of the elder evil's will. He travels endlessly, moving through the lands, always watching and searching for those marked for death. He is a reluctant servant, haunted by the memories of his life before the touch of evil, and he despairs about his fate.

A cult lucky (or unlucky) enough to have the service of such a monstrosity may very well bind it into an object such as an altar or magic item, while others may mask its appearance with a liberal use of illusion spells. Some even contain them with walls of force to keep them in reserve should their temple fall under attack.",

Occasionally, black cysts escape to visit horrors on the Material, usually, but not always, on behalf of Tharizdun's mortal servants.

If done correctly, the slaughter of these victims will entice a single black cyst to make its way to the site where the ritual was performed.",

If you wish to get around this, consider informing your players of this trait ahead of time so that they can come up with a plan to get around it. You may want to roll with what they come up with, or you can devise your own method for the party to get around it, such as an artifact that converts divine spells into regular arcane magic when held by a divine spellcaster. Or perhaps you want to just remove the trait, perhaps replacing it with a different malefic property, or just excluding it altogether. This is completely fine, and won't affect encounter difficulty too much, as these stat blocks are not specifically balanced around it. If you do keep it in, make it another obstacle to overcome, rather than an unfair roadblock that the players weren't expecting."

Avolakia clerics make good use of the {@spell create undead} spell to create undead such as ghasts and wights. They often arm these greater undead with magic weapons, armor, and wondrous items to aid them in defending the avolakias' territory.",

							"So eager are the avolakias to elevate Kyuss to full deity status that they actively recruit new worshipers for his cult. The creatures typically establish settlements beneath the communities of surface races, then use their Shapechanger and {@spell suggestion} abilities to infiltrate their target areas. Often a group of avolakias infiltrates a local religious institution and attempts to assume control of the funerary rites for the community. Should the avolakias succeed, they have access to plenty of corpses that they can use to create more undead. In addition, the disguised avolakias are in a perfect position to corrupt selected members of the community and slowly indoctrinate them into the {@cult Kyuss the Worm That Walks|EdE|cult of Kyuss}.",
							"Avolakias also interact with various Underdark races. Some, such as the drow, they infiltrate in much the same way as they do surface races. With others, such as mind flayers, they openly propose alliances for the two groups' mutual benefit. A typical agreement between mind flayers and avolakias stipulates that both groups hunt down and capture intelligent beings. The mind flayers consume the unfortunate victims' brains, then hand the bodies over to the avolakias, who use them to create undead. But such alliances tend to fall apart eventually, either when the mind flayers enslave captives for long periods before consuming their brains, or when the avolakias kill a few mind flayers to make more powerful undead creatures."

Avamerin unknowingly spread this message to the mortal civlizations, allowing for this revelation to become public and for godless priests to become more and more common throughout the world.",

Enraged, Avamerin cast aside his servitude and stole Sertrous's head, claiming that the dead demon was wiser than the gods. In response, the gods took away his angelic beauty and replaced it with the visage of a snake, and then banished him from the Upper Planes forever. Yet the damage had been done. The angel became the First Heretic, and he devoted the rest of his existence to serving the one who had opened his eyes. In time, the devotion of Avamerin and those he recruited to his Vanguard would be enough to restore Sertrous to life and prove what the fallen angel had come to believe was the truth beyond the lies of faith."

The culmination of that search was discovering the prison of Pandorym's mind, but the experience stripped him of his life and free will. His mind was overwhelmed by the elder evil's crushing power, which ripped his very soul from his body.",

He relentlessly hunts for anyone who has enough mental fortitude to withstand Pandorym's consciousness long enough to free the entity's psyche. More than a dozen unfortunate souls met their end in this way, many of them lingering as horrible undead. Lucather has now turned his malign intent toward one he is sure can pass the test\u2014his own daughter. He hopes to lure her, along with other worthy creatures, into his newly claimed lair.",

Even dormant, however, Father Llymic has ways of influencing the world around him. His tendrils worm through the surface of the ice, so that any who stand directly above him are affected by his corruption. In addition, he can project an image\u2014a shard of his dreaming mind\u2014into the world around him.",

Although the projection is slow of gait and never aggressive, it can never be caught. Whenever anyone draws too close, it steps out of sight, reappearing some distance away. If its targets refuse to follow it, the image grows agitated, appearing before them and silently screaming from a maw of razor-sharp ice fangs, then leaving to find other prey."

While I'm keeping this in as it's a Malefic Property outlined in the original book, some DMs might find it to be a bit unfair towards divine spellcasters in the party. If you wish to get around this, consider informing your players of this trait ahead of time so that they can come up with a plan to get around it. You may want to roll with what they come up with, or you can devise your own method for the party to get around it, such as an artifact that converts divine spells into regular arcane magic when held by a divine spellcaster. Or perhaps you want to just remove the trait, perhaps replacing it with a different malefic property, or just excluding it altogether. This is completely fine, and won't affect encounter difficulty too much, as these stat blocks are not specifically balanced around it. If you do keep it in, make it another obstacle to overcome, rather than an unfair roadblock that the players weren't expecting."

						"The deity {@deity Tiamat}, Creator of Evil Dragonkind, has long sought domination of the world for herself and her progeny. For eons she has struggled against Bahamut, the King of Good Dragons, in a conflict called the Dragonfall War, and most people believed that this battle would last for millennia to come.",
						"Recently, however, Tiamat unveiled her latest and most terrifying tactic. She created diverse and numerous creatures with the blood of chromatic dragons and sent forth these spawn to spread destruction and evil. This incursion of evil dragonblood creatures threatens the balance of the war and, by extension, the world.",
						"To thwart her ambitions, Bahamut created the noble dragonborn, but the challenge of fighting evil dragonkind demands even more heroes than the Platinum Dragon can produce. Today, Tiamat has the upper hand. It might well fall to the player characters to prevent her spawn from permanently tipping the Dragonfall War in favor of evil.",
						"Every spawn of Tiamat has some vestige of the power of the Queen of Evil Dragons in its blood. Many, though, are born not directly to her but to individual evil dragons throughout the world. Whether chosen by Tiamat herself or only by fickle chance, some chromatic dragon eggs hatch into the spawn described in this section. Usually a single egg is so touched, but occasionally an entire clutch produces spawn of Tiamat (which might not even be all the same kind). A given spawn is born only to a dragon that matches its color, which combined with the word \"spawn,\" forms part of its name. Blackspawn raiders and blackspawn stalkers, for example, are born only to black dragons. Although spawn first began to appear within clutches of dragon eggs, most of them breed true and now are rapidly multiplying.",
						"Evil dragons recognize the birth of a spawn of Tiamat as a fortunate omen, a sign of their creator's favor. That said, spawn rarely remain with their parents for long. They mature much more quickly than true dragons, reaching adulthood in only a few years. Spawn of Tiamat usually congregate with other creatures, whether in packs of their kind or with like-minded individuals of other races, particularly evil dragons. Reports have surfaced recently of hobgoblin clerics and warlords gathering spawn of Tiamat and other evil dragons for a great battle. Whether this is part of Tiamat's plan for the Dragonfall War or stems from the goblinoids' general antipathy toward other races is unknown.",
						"Regardless of their place in the world, all spawn share an unswerving loyalty to Tiamat, which their would-be allies would do well to remember. The spawn of Tiamat also share her undying hatred of good dragonkind, and they look down upon nondragons of all sorts.",

In addition, she has whispered promises of a return of the great Dhakaani Empire to certain hobgoblin warlords in Darguun. Using these contacts, Tiamat has been able to seed the world with her spawn, and they are ready for when the call to battle goes forth.",
								"Chromatic dragons not allied with Tiamat see the spawn's arrival as a dire portent that must somehow be related to the Prophecy, but they are oblivious to the true danger. They continue to do that for which Tiamat condemns them: They wait and watch, hoping to learn the true nature of these new dragonblood through observation and reflection on the Prophecy.",

Many lurk in dark corners of the world, roaming swamps, jungles, and caverns as they hunt their prey and wait for the call to join Tiamat's army.

						"Hailing from the lawful neutral plane of Mechanus, inevitables are constructs whose sole aim is to enforce the natural laws of the universe.",
						"Each type of inevitable is designed to find and punish a particular kind of transgression, hunting down a person or group that has violated a fundamental principle, such as \"The guilty should be punished,\" \"Bargains should be kept,\" or \"Everyone dies eventually.\" When an inevitable is created, it receives its first mission, then finds the transgressors and metes out appropriate punishment. The sentence is usually death, although some inevitables insist on compensation to the wronged party instead, using spells like {@spell geas} to ensure compliance. From its first step, an inevitable focuses totally on its target. It continues its efforts no matter how cold the trail or hopeless the task. If unable to cross an ocean any other way, inevitables have been known to walk into the waves, traversing the seabed to emerge on another continent months later.",
						"Inevitables are single-minded in pursuit of their quarry, but they are under orders to leave innocents alone. Accomplices to their prey are fair game, however, which sometimes creates conflicts within their programming. Even the most effective inevitables are periodically recalled to Mechanus for reprogramming.",
						"Inevitables gladly sacrifice themselves to complete a mission, but they aren't suicidal. Faced with impending defeat, they are likely to withdraw and seek a way to even the odds. They are determined but patient foes. They ally with others if that helps accomplish their mission, but they have a hard time keeping allies for long. It's apparent to anyone who spends much time with one that an inevitable would sacrifice an ally to fulfill its purpose without a second thought.",
						"When an inevitable completes its task, it wanders the landscape and passively observes life around it. When it discerns another transgression of the principle it is dedicated to, it has a new mission. Inevitables tend to stick out in a crowd while they're in observation mode, but they seem oblivious to the attention. Those in the know who hear about a 12-foot-tall, golden-armored statue roaming the countryside might seek out the inevitable and present a case, hoping it will take on the alleged transgressor. The decision is based on the idiosyncrasies of the inevitable's programming, so there's no guarantee.",

				"Based on the experience of myself and others when running certain monsters, I find that keeping track of auras (such as {@creature Gorguth|EdE}'s Aura of Annihilation and Death Gaze) is very tedious and easy to forget. This happens because such an aura typically takes when another creature starts (or ends) its turn within a certain range of the aura's origin. Especially when such auras have saving throws attached to them, they quickly start to bog down the game with dice rolling and number crunching.",
				"The issue I face is two-fold: first, official monsters already work this way, so for me to go against it could potentially be confusing to DMs that are already used to it. Second, as auras are constantly emanating, it makes sense that they take effect on every creatures' turns; other solutions contradict this logic by allowing creatures to pass through them without necessarily being affected.",
				"With that in mind, I still present to you this variant: rather than having an aura affect creatures at the start of their turns, have them affect creatures at the start of the aura emanator's turn. This may require some reflavoring - for example, a Negative Energy Aura would be flavored as a periodic burst of negative energy coming from an {@creature atropal|ToA}, rather than being a constant sphere around the atropal. However, this solution can drastically speed up your game; not to mention, your game being bogged down is probably even more immersion breaking than an aura that is ran using this variant."

Dreadful seed and falling stars produce monstrous offspring in worlds Ragnorra approaches\u2014and now she smashes into worlds to remake them directly.",

With the rise of the tanar'ri, Sertrous was exiled from the Abyss and took the form of a monstrous serpent, granting vile powers to the yuan-ti in exchange for their service. Even though he was slain, Sertrous lingers in spirit and continues to corrupt the snake people. His followers, the Vanguard of Sertrous, employ intrigue and magic to gain influence and ultimately bring about the end of the world.",

Its essence transferred itself to the worms and maggots that devoured the deity's corpse, forming a hideous but vaguely humanoid shape. The horror was sealed away in an obelisk by heroes of a previous age. It seeks ever to escape and eat its way to world domination, one writhing victim at a time.",
										"{@b Chapter 10. Zargon:} According to legend, Zargon cannot be killed unless his horn is severed from his body, and if his horn is not destroyed, he will inevitably return to claim it. The immortals could not discover a means of destroying his horn, and thus they entombed Zargon and a whole city of his mad worshipers in a place now lost to history."

Even as the elves tried to close the gate, strange things slipped through, forever tying the world to the Far Realm. Although many of these entities have surfaced over the years only to be banished or destroyed, some remain to spread their foul taint. The records are far from clear, but the name of Father Llymic appears more than once.",
								"Creatures of the Far Realm do not obey natural laws; their alien nature is deadly to those who come in contact with them. However, the world can affect them in strange ways as well. Ancient records made by the Vast Gate survivors note that some of the Far Realm entities could not live in the world. Some died unnatural deaths, while others merely ceased to function, going into a sort of dormancy until conditions would be right for them to thrive. One such entity seemed to have an aversion to light. Although it was paralyzed, some aspect of this creature remained able to send illusory projections, beckoning the unwary to visit his unmoving form. These projections gave Father Llymic his name, since the twisted monstrosity was hidden beneath an illusion of a kindly old man.",
								"Although dormant, Father Llymic still proved deadly. Those fooled by his illusions were soon tainted by his corruption and had to be destroyed. Although exposing him to light caused dormancy, it also caused his form to radiate waves of deadly cold. Soon, sheets of ice began to engulf his body. The elves moved him to a mountaintop, where his chill would not harm anyone and the light of the sun might keep him dormant forever. The few remaining caretaker elves eventually died, and Father Llymic was forgotten.",
								"Legends about Father Llymic grow vague beyond the confines of his mountain prison. Some rumors hold that the last great age of ice can be attributed to him, when darkness covered the land and he was nearly freed from his lethargy. One tale speaks of icy alien creatures that wear the tattered clothing of mountain barbarians and prowl the high passes, bringing freezing darkness with them wherever they go."

On each of its turns while berserk, a creature attacks the nearest creature it can see. If no creature is near enough to move to and attack, the creature attacks an object, with preference for an object smaller than itself. Once the creature goes berserk, it continues to do so until it kills another creature or is itself killed. At the end of the rage, the creature (if it survives) suffers one level of {@condition exhaustion}.",

										"{@b SPL 5:} Soelma Nilaenish hires the party to discreetly retrieve property that was stolen by a rival scholar. The property in question is a copy of the {@item Zoretha Scrolls|EdE}, and Nilaenish is concerned about the manuscript falling into the \"wrong hands\". Everything seems completely legitimate, and Nilaenish's rival is violently insane. The party retrieves the item as requested and return it to the scholar's safekeeping. She promises to lock the book away safely where no one will ever read it again.",
										"{@b SPL 10 (Faint Sign):} Tempers are on the rise everywhere when the party's old employer, Soelma Nilaenish, contacts them again. She expects trouble at the building where she meets with her scholarly society. She fears that someone wishes to break into the society's artifact collection, which contains a copy of the Zoretha Scrolls. The party arrives to find a riot outside the building and must help authorities to calm or disperse the mob. Nilaenish pays them handsomely and seems not to fully understand how or why the riot started. There is no further trouble, but the society increases magical security on its collection of artifacts.",
										"Around the same time, the party first hears rumors of a band of evil cultists led by a giant called Soulbiter. Soulbiter's followers have been raiding settlements and causing havoc in the far north.",
										"{@b SPL 15 (Moderate Sign):} Distressed by a recent discovery, Soelma Nilaenish contacts the party to act as her bodyguards on a long journey to the far north. There, she explains, an evil giant is attempting to awaken an ancient evil that she associates with the recent violent behavior of the common people. Near the end of the journey, the party encounters Janwulf the Soulbiter and his followers. Janwulf is familiar with Nilaenish and acts as if she has betrayed him somehow. After his defeat at the party's hands, Nilaenish leads the party into a death trap, reveals herself to be a powerful and evil wizard, and leaves with Janwulf's followers in her service. She also leaves full payment for the party's services as a joke.",
										"{@b SPL 18 (Strong Sign):} After learning where Nilaenish has gone, the party arrives just in time to interrupt her ritual. Assuming they defeat her, they recover her copy of the Zoretha Scrolls. Since the Hulks are still quiescent, the party seem to be victorious. A blank page is torn out of the end of Nilaenish's book, however, and one of Janwulf's more memorable cultists was not present at Nilaenish's final battle (see Encounters 1 and 2).",
										"By this point in the campaign, most major nations are at war with one another. Fighting is constant everywhere the party goes.",
										"{@b SPL 20 (Overwhelming Sign):} Whether or not the party attempts to track down the missing page and cultist, they arrive back at the Hulks too late to stop the second ritual. The cultist used the original, crumbling Zoretha Scrolls and ritual instructions scrawled on a scrap of parchment from the back of Nilaenish's copy. The Hulks awaken, and the party must fight all five to save the world (see Encounter 3)."

										"When compared to the other eight Elder Evils here, the Hulks of Zoretha could be considered the most underwhelming. One reason for this is that each individual Hulk is much weaker than many of the monsters out there. Even Soelma and Janwulf are higher in CR than an individual Hulk. Rather, the global threat posed by the Hulks' Blood Moon sign makes them a world-ending threat; additionally, the five Hulks are designed to be a challenge even for high level characters when fought all at once.",
										"The second reason for this is that there is so much missed potential for their story. The original Elder Evils book describes that the Hulks are part of an alien race that sent them to colonize the campaign setting; once they awaken and eradicate all sapient life on the planet, they will give birth to the \"Children of Zoretha\". Such children were not given statistics nor descriptions in the original book, as it is assumed that the players will defeat the Hulks before they have a chance to give birth to them.",
										"However, what if a DM wanted to change up the story? Perhaps the Children of Zoretha have begun to bring chaos and destruction to the setting, in an effort to awaken their dormant parents. Perhaps the Hulks and their now matured Children have already colonized a different world and have now begun to invade the campaign setting. It is unfortunate that the original book did not provide the tools necessary in order to facilitate such stories.",
										"As mentioned, the Hulks of Zoretha are underwhelming because they are required to individually be weak in order to be a group encounter for high level players. Thus, DMs that feel the Hulks are boring as a group may run them as one colossal Elder Evil that I dubbed the \"Titan of Zoretha\".",
										"A five-headed monolith big enough to tackle a tarrasque, the Titan of Zoretha can be used as a replacement of the five Hulks in a standard campaign. However, if a DM makes the Hulks and Children of Zoretha non-unique (i.e. a reoccuring monster type throughout the campaign), the Titan of Zoretha would instead be used as their leader. This way, the aliens of Zoretha can be used as an entire faction of enemies, rather than relying on cultists and the Hulks' Blood Moon sign to create conflict throughout the campaign.",
										"Thus, I included statistics for the Children of Zoretha (both {@creature child of zoretha (female)|EdE|Females} and {@creature child of zoretha (male)|EdE|Males}) and the variant {@creature Titan of Zoretha|EdE} in this conversion.

Throughout the campaign, more and more aberrations might threaten the world in preparation for the Hulks' awakening.",
												"Elaborate upon the mysterious place called Zoretha. In a Spelljammer campaign, perhaps Zoretha is a distant crystal sphere that the other denizens of Zoretha call home. In a planar campaign, perhaps Zoretha is a new plane of existence from outside the Great Wheel, or it is a small crevasse between two planes that has been undetected by mortal civilization.",
												"Change the motivation of the Hulks as you see fit. As alien colonizers, the Hulks might seek to enslave the mortal races instead, using what is left of civlization when they awaken to construct a new society for their Children to live in. Or perhaps the Hulks seek to open a portal to Zoretha, allowing the rest of their kind to flood into their new colony. You can also change the motivations of the Cult of Zoretha. Perhaps they can perform sacrificial rituals in order to create or summon the Children of Zoretha, or maybe their desire to spread madness to all has allowed them to create the Blood Moon sign themselves."

The party must stop the cultists and any creatures they have summoned, but Enshaddon escapes in the confusion, diving back into the sea to keep his real identity secret.",

								"The gods would have mortals believe that in the beginning, they created the world. That they helped shape the world is not in dispute, but they were far from the first to cast their influence across the Material Plane. The aboleths lived in the primeval depths before the first deity wrought life from primal clay. The elemental races established vast multiplanar empires long before the first priest offered prayers from a crude stone altar. And in the roiling deep of the Abyss, demons had already conquered entire planes before the advent of intelligent life on the Material Plane. Most powerful among these ancient demons were the obyrith lords.",
								"Led by the Queen of Chaos, the obyriths waged murder against the elemental Wind Dukes of Aaqa. Those who refused to join the Queen were punished and imprisoned. Obox-ob, then the Prince of Demons, withstood her call. In a great war, the Queen defeated Obox-ob and crowned her consort, Miska the Wolf Spider, the new Prince of Demons. Yet when the Queen's legions were defeated on the Fields of Pesh, it was ironically the obyrith lords she had cast out or imprisoned who survived.",
								"One such obyrith lord was Sertrous, a minor demon lord associated at the time with parasites and crawling things. Ever rebellious, Sertrous slew every demon that came to his Abyssal lair to recruit him to the Queen's cause. He had little defense against the Queen herself, who quickly grew tired of his insubordination, destroyed his body, and cast his essence into the gulf between planes as one might cast aside a carcass. Yet this did not spell Sertrous's doom. As his essence passed through the Material Plane, Sertrous made a desperate grab at an anchor to prevent his passage into the void beyond. All he found was a lowly serpent, wallowing in the mire of a primeval fen.",
								"For untold centuries, Sertrous lived as a serpent. At first, he was confined to that serpent's body. As he healed, his essence transformed the serpent into a new physicality that took on the madness of his previous demonic form. Yet he retained serpentine features\u2014partially as a disguise if agents of the Queen encounter him. Sertrous watched from his fen as the mortal races grew civilized, established their own empires, and raised temples to honor the gods. Sertrous grew jealous of their prosperity and coveted the devotion mortals heaped upon the gods. And so he waged war on them, plaguing these first nations with armies of serpents and monsters from the fen.",
								"When the beleaguered mortals called upon one of their deity's most powerful minions, the solar Avamerin, Sertrous claimed his first and greatest victory. Avamerin led a great army into the fen to destroy Sertrous. The obyrith's minions were evenly matched with the angel's, and in the end only the obyrith and the angel survived to face one another. The battle was intense, but in the end the solar defeated the serpent. As Avamerin raised his sword and prepared to strike the killing blow, Sertrous asked him a simple question: \"Why serve your lord when his playthings can gain the same strength of power through their own will?\" Avamerin struck then, slaying Sertrous. He returned to civilization with the obyrith's head as proof of his triumph and spoke to the nation's priests of the demon's foolish words.",
								"Yet in spreading these words, Avamerin unwittingly released a great secret. Scholars and priests puzzled over Sertrous's dying words and made an incredible discovery: One need not worship a god to gain the power of divine magic. Rather than worship a god, a cleric could worship an ideal and gain the same reward. He could worship the mountains, or the sky, or the act of war, or himself. He could even worship a slain obyrith lord. Avamerin saw this plague of godless priests thrive and was powerless to stop it. The solar realized his error, and when he confessed to his lord, he was stripped of his rank and reduced to a planetar's status.",
								"Enraged, Avamerin cast aside his servitude and stole Sertrous's head, claiming that the dead demon was wiser than the gods. The gods recoiled and took from Avamerin his beauty. If he would ascribe such value to a serpent's words, he would be one with them. The gods gave him the visage of a snake and banished him from heaven. Yet the damage had been done. The angel became the first heretic, and he devoted the rest of his existence to serving the one who had opened his eyes. In time, the devotion of Avamerin and those he recruited to his Vanguard would be enough to restore Sertrous to life and prove what the fallen angel had come to believe was the truth beyond the lies of faith."

Thousands of years ago, these nihilistic yuan-ti, whose priests taught that worship of the gods was unnecessary to gain divine power, surged from a trackless fen to lay siege to the surrounding nations. The Vanguard was defeated, but its teachings proved immortal. Every few hundred years, a new zealot takes up the cause and leads a new army on the march.",
								"Although the armies through the years rose from different regions, they all shared similar tactics and compositions. Without variation, the Vanguard is led by yuan-ti but filled with enslaved or dominated minions. When its numbers reach the right point, its leaders unleash hordes of transformed and corrupted slaves and minions in a wave of murder and mayhem.",

The rank-and-file soldier in the Vanguard does not know this. The teachings of Sertrous come to the leaders through the decapitated head of their demonic patron, preserved in a secret reliquary.",
								"The first Vanguard army was led by Sertrous himself, who marched upon his neighbors in a rage fueled by jealousy. He coveted their cities, their accomplishments, and most of all the adoration the citizens heaped upon the gods. Sertrous wanted to be worshiped and held in awe, and the only way he could accomplish this was through conquest. He was slain by the angel Avamerin, who, it is rumored, later fell victim to the Vanguard and was himself slain.",
								"Sertrous's true reasons for waging war on the Material Plane are more than mere jealousy. He wishes to return to the Abyss and reclaim his realm now that the time of the Queen of Chaos is past. Although he is dead, his spirit persists both in his severed head and in the rebellious will of Avamerin, who serves as the leader of the Vanguard in Sertrous's absence. With each war, the souls of those who die in the Vanguard's service are drawn into the Abyss to await their master's return, while at the same time the armies and resources of his Material Plane enemies are depleted. When his army of slithering petitioners in the Abyss is great enough, he shall return to life and reclaim his throne as a demon lord."

When he was finished, he stepped into the stone, fusing his essence with the foul rock, gaining and losing his divinity in one moment. He was neither mortal nor god\u2014he was something far worse."

								"As with all cultures, it didn't last. The kingdom's success bred complacency and decadence, and the population plunged itself into excess. This laxity enabled a bloodthirsty cult to come to power and perform unspeakable sacrifices to their dark god, Zargon. For years, the kingdom declined, languishing under the yoke of oppression, until a great barbarian horde smashed the nation, slaughtered the people, and scattered them across the lands.",
								"Though barbarians need little provocation to attack soft cities, the army attacking the kingdom had long suffered depredations at the hands of the cultists. The cult of Zargon needed human sacrifices to feed to its god, and when its members exhausted themselves of nonbelievers and criminals from their own people, they enslaved others for this purpose. A charismatic barbarian leader named Zankar gathered the tribes and sacked the city, having lost too many of his kinsmen to the madmen of Cynidicea.",
								"The tribal leader made a terrifying discovery when his horde tore through the nation's capital city: The god they worshiped was no otherworldly being; it was a terrifying monster that lorded over them all, demanding appalling sacrifices to appease its dreadful hunger. The streets were slick with blood and a disgusting slime.",

Although considered one of the greatest warriors in the land, he could not kill the beast\u2014as soon as he struck a blow, Zargon's wounds would heal. Zankar grew weary, giving the monster the opportunity it needed. Within moments, the climactic duel came to a sudden and bloody end.",
								"The gods blessed Zankar, but their champion failed. The gods themselves came to the earth to punish the kingdom and put Zargon to rest. When they appeared, the elder evil mocked them. Zargon slew some of them and drove off the rest. Survivors of the barbarian invasion witnessed Zargon's might and feared the world would end, so they fled into the caves beneath their city.",
								"Zargon seemed unstoppable, but he had one foe remaining. Eons earlier, Zargon had ruled the Nine Hells of Baator as father of the ancient baatorians, a long-extinct race that preceded the baatezu. His kingdom was a terrifying place, filled with running slime and rampant evil. When Asmodeus and his allies seized the Nine Hells, they purged the plane of the baatorians, enslaving them and destroying their lords. Asmodeus butchered most himself, but Zargon was resilient to the worst attacks. Asmodeus discovered he could kill the flesh of the beast, but not the horn, so he tore it from Zargon's head and flung the hateful spur out of the hells and to the Material Plane, where it pierced deep into the earth.",
								"Driven from the Nine Hells, Zargon's flesh re-formed around his horn, and he turned his attention to the Material Plane. It took centuries, but he crawled up from the depths of the earth and set upon the soft mortals dwelling in the kingdom above. To spare themselves extinction, the people of the kingdom raised up Zargon as their god and fed him endless sacrifi ces to appease his need to kill.",
								"Although the death of the gods did not distress Asmodeus in the least, the freedom of this elder evil did. Asmodeus stepped in to stop Zargon for the last time. Since the lord of Nessus was not a god, he was not vulnerable to the worst of Zargon's powers. Still, he knew he could not slay the beast. Instead, he imprisoned the elder evil in solid stone, so only the horn was visible. He then turned to Zargon's Cynidicean worshipers, burying them alive in the tunnels."

Zargon saw these creatures as soft, weak, and useless. He devoured them in awful numbers, but soon they worshiped him as a god, something he felt Asmodeus would never attain. Since his congregation was so willing to feed his hunger, he played along, killing and eating anything it gave him.",

On its own, Shothragot's awakening endangers all mortal life on a given world. But this pales in comparison to the true threat: the release of its master Tharizdun, who seeks to bring about the end of the universe, and has the means to achieve it.",

								"It is telling that the origins of the Dark God are buried beneath layers of secrecy. All faiths oppose the cults who serve He of Eternal Darkness, and to whisper his name is tantamount to blasphemy. The fear Tharizdun evokes and the intensity of his opposition are all well-founded since even the gods themselves, good and evil alike, share this trepidation. The reason is simple: The Ebon God wants nothing more than to unravel the nature of reality, to undo all the works of gods and mortals, to shatter the planes, and dissolve all things to their fundamental natures. Tharizdun is an uncaring force of destruction, motivated by an inexplicable need to eradicate all things, himself included.",
								"Since Tharizdun works always to bring ruin, the gods set aside their differences and sealed the dreadful power away, holding him in stasis so his malign will and countless servants could no longer threaten the balance of the cosmos. And though the gods returned to squabbling soon after his imprisonment eons ago, they remain united in their distaste and fear of their ancient enemy and, to this day, they are all committed to ensuring he remains safely tucked away beyond the reach of misguided fools. That the Dark God remains sealed away in a prison plane in some forgotten corner of the multiverse, though, is no consolation. The divine seals may contain him, but Tharizdun can extend his malign will beyond them, caressing the minds of his servants and impelling them to do his bidding. Assuming the guise of the Elder Elemental Eye, he has accumulated numerous disturbing cults that swear their allegiance to the multifaceted nature of their insane master, fighting each other as much as they move toward their unholy mission of releasing a power whose fullness and wickedness they only dimly realize.",
								"Champions of the various gods and agencies remain vigilant against the legions of the Elder Elemental Eye, by sacking their temples, raiding their redoubts, and executing cultists wherever they find them, but few realize the true breadth of Tharizdun's power. A small body of scholars and sages believes that Tharizdun's greatest servants are the elder evils themselves. So while the courageous heroes fight Tharizdun's minions, the Dark God compels the elder evils to stir and awaken so that they may ravage the world and weaken its gods. Tharizdun hopes that when he finally weakens the wards holding him, he will emerge unopposed.",
								"While various elder evils may or may not respond to the summons of the Dark God, Tharizdun's chief creation, an abomination named Shothragot, awoke in the cyclopean depths of the earth, far below the mines of a temple devoted to the Elder Elemental Eye. Weak and nearly powerless after years of undisturbed slumber, it siphons power from the prayers of the unwitting servants above, biding its time until it gains the strength it needs to set in motion the final events that would see its master free.",
								"While having an awakened elder evil is terrifying to conceive by itself, Shothragot is a special case, for this dreadful horror's origins trace back to the Invoked Devastation and the Rain of Colorless Fire, when Tharizdun's servants summoned forth his avatar for the last time. Whether or not its appearance compelled the use of appalling magic that brought death and devastation to hundreds of thousands is a matter of debate, but what is known is that almost as fast as the avatar appeared, so too did he vanish after the wrought destruction. Most scholars suspect the avatar was destroyed in the conflagration, but in truth, it was weakened, dreadfully so, and the powerful energies unleashed left the avatar crippled. Thus it fled into the bowels of the earth, where it waited.",
								"Shothragot might have laid in wait forever, but its slumber was disturbed when a most unfortunate happenstance occurred. A band of adventurers, whose purpose was to destroy a cult of the Elder Elemental Eye infesting the mines around a fortress of wickedness, found their own deaths, nearly to the man. When a fleeing survivor became lost and stumbled into the elder evil crèche, Shothragot awoke, seized the mortal, and refashioned him using the last spark of divine essence to make him his principle servant. With his new agent in the field and with the prayers dedicated to the Elder Elemental Eye infusing him with power, the elder evil now swells with power and is nearly ready to reveal itself and bring about the release of its beloved master."

What it does know is that it has many enemies arrayed against it, and so it is careful not to reveal itself until such time that it is strong enough to smash those who stand against it.",
								"Its need for joining Tharizdun fills its thoughts, but it has no clear understanding of how it should go about achieving this end. The only thing it receives are fleeting images, disparate memories of sensations and emotions, and a deep and abiding hatred. From time to time, a face swims into its consciousness, and when it appears, it compels its minions to seek out and destroy these individuals, although even it knows not why. In truth, it is Tharizdun himself who dispatches these messages to remove obstacles that would prevent Shothragot from completing its mission.",
								"Of late, Shothragot has become aware of a number of black jewels, 333 to be exact, known as the Gems of Tharizdun. It's not certain, but it suspects these items are integral to dissolving the wards holding his master in stasis. Thus, while its agents go out and murder his enemies, they are ever watchful for the 333 Gems of Tharizdun, which they bring back to the growing elder evil. Shothragot consumes and destroys each one they return to him, bloating on the released energy while simultaneously sending currents of destructive energies through Tharizdun's oubliette"

Also present are several insane cultists who plunder the place in search of something.",

Attempts to reach it through magic utterly fail; it always seems to move just out of reach. No one seems to know what it signifies, but certain types of spells are becoming harder to cast.",
										"Tharizdun, peering into the future, senses the characters are a dire threat, and so it dispatches a dream to Shothragot, who in turn sends its greatest minion, {@creature Giorge Forsworn|EdE}, to attend to them. The mortal hunter plays a cat-and-mouse game, murdering those closest to the characters first and then picking off the heroes one at a time.",
										"{@b SPL 12 (Moderate Sign):} As the sign in the sky intensifies, the greatest minds in the lands set to unravel the mystery of its appearance. A wide range of theories abound, but {@creature Jallarzi Sallavarian|EdE}, a powerful archmage and member of the Circle of Eight (or some other arcane group), is close and she believes the glyph signifies a dire threat to the world, suspecting it may have something to do with Tharizdun. Well-acquainted with the history of the Dark God, she sets out for the Sea of Dust to find the Forgotten City in the hopes of unraveling the mystery of the glyph.",
										"When she doesn't return, the remaining members of the Circle of Eight, who work to undo the expanding sign, hire the adventurers to track the missing wizard. Enduring a long and perilous journey and exploring the haunted ruins of the ancient city, the adventurers learn the history of the avatar, but not before being confronted by the warped Jallarzi, who, through dabbling with dangerous magic, has become a twisted creature of the Dark God.",
										"{@b SPL 15 (Strong Sign):} Armed with the information uncovered in the Forgotten City and burdened with the horrible fate of an esteemed member of the Circle, the adventurers return to the Circle of Eight, only to find that the sign has grown even stronger. Cross-referencing their information with that of the powerful wizards, Mordenkainen suggests the heroes explore former strongholds of Tharizdun's cultists to see if they can learn of some way to stop the impending apocalypse. The party journies to the Temple of Elemental Evil, the Crater Ridge Mines, and other locations, each site revealing a bit more about the enemy they face.",
										"{@b SPL 18 (Overwhelming Sign):} Just as the heroes are exploring the final known site, the caldera formed by the Crater Ridge explodes, and amidst the debris and destruction rises a massive globe of dripping black corruption. As it rises, the sign in the heavens expands until it stretches from one horizon to the next. Horrific insane creatures come and go from the bulk, emerging from orifices that pierce its glistening hide.",

Whatever you decide, this adventure will be a challenge, and its outcome could have lasting effects on your campaign setting, as is fitting for any scenario featuring an elder evil as the principle villain.",
										"This adventure is designed for experienced DMs. It is a difficulty foray, featuring numerous monsters and adversaries with a broad range of abilities, in deadly environments, and with the fate of your campaign setting at stake. You could downplay any of these elements, altering the nature of the elder evil and recast the adventure to have less impact on your world. You can swap out monsters for those you feel have a stronger connection to your personal campaign setting, or even discard the adventure entirely and pull the creatures out to populate a dungeon of your own design. However you use this adventure, \"The Essence of Evil\" is bound to take your players to the brink and test their skills and abilities in ways they've never been tested before."

										"Few names strike as much fear as the dreaded Tharizdun. The Dark God has many names, looming large in the minds of every sentient race to walk the Material Plane. He is known as the Patient One, He of Eternal Darkness, while others call him the Elder Elemental Eye, the Ebon God, or by any of countless other appellations. All of these are masks\u2014facades to conceal utter malevolence and evil. A god so powerful and so destructive, his mere existence compelled the gods of good and evil to set aside their differences and lock him away for all time. This is Tharizdun, the lord of entropy, the force of decay and destruction in the multiverse. He is the god of madness, the father of endings, and to some, he is the sire of elder evils.",
										"In spite of the gods' efforts to contain this malign entity, Tharizdun's touch has not been far from mortal minds. In their dreams, their fantasies, their feverish thoughts, he whispers unspeakable secrets, driving mad those who would listen, seducing them with promises of power, wealth, the fulfillment of their lust, vengeance, and anything else he can to fill their souls with an unquenchable thirst to serve his awful will. He puts before his servants one dreadful task. He demands freedom\u2014release from the hateful bonds that contain him in the far-flung prison deep inside the gloomiest depths of the Ethereal Plane. It is a task many have promised to fulfill but none have achieved, for the enemies of the Dark God are many and varied, drawn to oppose the certain destruction his release threatens. So it is that history is littered with corpses of Tharizdun's failed servants, of bold cultists cast down, and of entire civilizations brought to ruin for their allegiance to this foul master. To many, it seems Tharizdun is a tired threat, an old menace easily thwarted and one not worth committing the resources and heroes to defeat, for too often his minions find defeat. While some still remain committed to being vigilant against Tharizdun's endless legions, the cancer spreads and complacency blooms in the hearts of those that matter. It is but a matter of time before the world becomes too soft\u2014too weak\u2014to oppose him and his children, and that time is now.",
										"Deep beneath a forlorn volcano, long dormant but active with the servants of the Elder Elemental Eye, lays a dreadful thing\u2014a fragment of He of Eternal Darkness brought low ages ago by powerful magic. For centuries, the abomination has waited, growing fat on the prayers of those mortal above that gave their lives and those of their sacrifices to honor their insane master. Never content with such petty supplications, the entity divided its minions into factions and turned them against one another, compelling them to fight and murder, to harvest the souls of their brethren in evil. Each new death fed the elder evil, awakening a dire intelligence and a grim awareness until it took a name and found its purpose. It became Shothragot, the Herald of Tharizdun and the key to unlock the dread prison.",
										"As it stirred and trembled, it called upon awful servants to slaughter those remaining enemies, to winnow the ranks of those divine servants who would stand against it as it blossomed into the fullness of its horrid form. It assumed control over the scattered cultists, compelling them to seek out the keys that would unlock the dark god's prison, to find the 333 Gems of Tharizdun and return them to it so the Herald might consume them and grow powerful on their energies. For eight long years, the Herald feasted, growing fat on the burgeoning wickedness, greedily swallowing the stones as quickly as they arrived. The last gemstone devoured, Shothragot is ready to seek out its dread master. It tears free from its hidden redoubt and drifts into the heavens to make its final journey."

										"Shothragot's sign of apocalypse is at full strength and the land shudders under the weight of the elder evil and its progress. Since Shothragot's agents murdered or imprisoned most other would-be champions and heroes, it falls to the player characters to attend to this apocalyptic threat. Fighting the elder evil itself is impossible since it is too big and too resilient to be destroyed from outside. Instead, the heroes must journey inside the elder evil, seek out its essence, and destroy it.",
										"A number of complications combine to make this task extraordinarily difficult. First, there's the matter of reaching the elder evil. Certainly, characters of this level should have means to reach the mass by means of a {@spell fly} spell, but note that so long as the glyph continues to burn in the heavens, teleportation spells automatically fail. Once the characters reach the elder evil, they have to find a way inside.",
										"Within, the player characters learn there is no way to reach the essence of Shothragot due to a sealed portal that, thanks to the glyph, no longer functions and blocks the passage. Diminishing the glyph is possible if the characters destroy all of the {@item Gem of Tharizdun|EdE|Gems of Tharizdun} (see area 4). This causes the glyph to recede and gives the party the chance to jump through the portal at area 6 to face the essence in area 22. Unfortunately, weakening the glyph also enables the elder evil to slip free from the Material Plane. Once there, the party must overcome the essence before it reaches Tharizdun's prison plane.",
										"A better solution is to find the {@item torch of revealing|EdE} and the {@item incense of dreaming|EdE} (found in area 18). If the adventurers bring the lit torch to the portal, the light it radiates opens the portal and allows the party to slip through without releasing the elder evil.",

												"As an elder evil, Shothragot's appearance in the world triggers the appearance of a sign of the apocalypse, a potent sigil that warns mortals of the impending doom. In the case of this abomination, the sign is of divine origin, a seal to contain the wickedness of this appalling entity and prevent its reunion with Tharizdun.",
												"Undoubtedly, the player characters as wellas countless others, have felt the sign intensify, catching sight of its manifestation, first in subtle ways, but growing more powerful as Shothragot grows in power. The Herald's particular sign manifests as the Seal of Binding, a strange glyph that spreads across the heavens to interfere with conjuration magic. For details on the sign's full effects, see page 2 of this document. At the start of The Essence of Evil, Shothragot's sign is at Overwhelming strength. If you intend to run this adventure as the conclusion of your campaign, consider revealing the sign earlier to signal the approaching doom.",
												"Since noticing something is wrong is unavoidable, the player characters should have plenty of opportunity to research the sign's implications and associations and perhaps learn something more of Tharizdun in the process. Regardless of the party's preparations, the full weight of the threat reveals itself when Shothragot tears free from the Crater Ridge Mines and drifts into the sky toward the glyph burning in the heavens. Whatever the thing is, it aims to reach the fiery sign, and who can say what will happen when it reaches it?"

As long as it remains, it cannot leave the Material Plane. Thus, the elder evil commands its servant Lareth the Beautiful to destroy the Gems it has swallowed, but the cleric is reluctant for it knows guardians protect the stones and he fears he lacks the power to destroy them. Thus the elder evil hovers until its servant finds the courage to do as he is bid.",
												"Another complication is that as the elder evil grew, it attracted the noisome attention of all manner of fiends. Demons, elementals, and corrupted abominations have burrowed into its form, some to worship it, others to accompany it as it makes its passage into the Ethereal Plane. If the elder evil cares, it shows no sign and seems content to let the parasites exist for now."
