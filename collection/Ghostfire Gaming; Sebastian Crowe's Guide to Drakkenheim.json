However, the Directorate does not love his quirky and rambunctious attitude, and have been waiting for him to slip up for years so they can replace the headmaster. Rupert however, is not a dullard, and knows well the opinion his higher ups have of him. He has a cunning intellect and mind for politics that many do not expect, and carefully treads the line of being regarded by his staff and students as carefree, fun-loving, and a joy to work with, while also making sure he stays well within the guidelines, rules, and structure laid out by the Academy. Whenever he is asked to answer to the Directorate, Rupert comes prepared with ironclad documents and signed papers to prove all his claims, ensuring the Directorate cannot find a sliver of a reason to justifiably remove him."

The Scalebreakers count amongst their ranks some of the greatest monster hunters the world has ever known, and are specifically trained in the art of hunting and killing dragons. Rising in its ranks is among the highest honors in Caspia for warriors who do not belong directly to one of the six Great Houses, and the legion has been instrumental in protecting the realms of Caspia from dragons and other monsters, but also from foreign invasions.",
						"The Scalebreaker Legion has existed in some form in Caspia even before the nation itself, but rose to modern prominence when they defeated the invading forces of Albrecht von Drakken in the year 822. During the Dragonfall War, Scalebreaker Knights slew the House von Drakken dragons and routed their armies, and Commander Bernard of the Scalebreakers presented the head of Albrecht von Drakken himself to High King Andromeda Jones at the Tower of Swords."

When these mundane methods are not enough, they use arcane magic and eldritch forces to restore their patients. An apothecary's unique skills prove useful whether their patients suffer from natural or supernatural ailments, but apothecaries possess knowledge of the body which can be used for more than just healing. Their arcane methods can strengthen, transform, or protect their allies, and some apothecaries know deadly techniques which can harm and kill their enemies. An apothecary understands how the difference between a poison and a cure lies often only in the dose.",
