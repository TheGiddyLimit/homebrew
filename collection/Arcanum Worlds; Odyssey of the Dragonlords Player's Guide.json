Each of them was harnessed to a plow and forced to tread the same winding, geometric path, until that path became a deep, labyrinthian gorge. Eventually, the plows broke, and the people of Minos slowly began to stand upright again\u2014but their faces had been forever changed by the curse.",

Sydon heard this from his throne in Praxys and scowled. \"Were they truly grateful, they would not build their towers to rival mine.\"",

They dismantled their towers and composed new melodies\u2014songs of repentance\u2014which once more carried on the winds to the ears of the Titan. He was unmoved. \"Were they truly repentant, they would not sing so brazenly, but they would go meekly and offer the proper sacrifices in place of songs.\"",
							"This time, the sirens were utterly stricken. They had believed that their songs were cherished by the gods. Their voices were stilled, and in the ensuing silence, the brilliance of the city faded into shadow. Stone foundations cracked, and pediments grew heavy. The pillars collapsed, and the city of the sirens sank deep into the ocean, swallowed by churning waters. Even its name was forgotten.",
							"Centuries passed in silence. Eventually, a new song began\u2014an endless lamentation for the city that now sleeps on the ocean floor. When Lutheria learned that the city of the sirens had been destroyed, she laughed.
