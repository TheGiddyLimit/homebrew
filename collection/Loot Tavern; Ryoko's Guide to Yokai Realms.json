				"When certain classes reach 5th level, they gain the Extra Attack feature, allowing them to attack twice when they take the Attack action on their turn. The following optional rules give these classes an Improved Extra Attack feature, which is enhanced at 7th level. These features reflect the identity and flavour of each class to emphasise distinct styles. They also give a minor boost in power to classes that primarily make attacks with weapons at a level when spellcasters begin to enjoy unmatched flexibility. Finally, these optional rules add a greater degree of gameplay variation between classes. A fighter and barbarian should feel different to play, right down to the tactics and experience built into their Attack action.",
				"If a character has multiclassed and gained the Improved Extra Attack feature from more than one class, they choose which one to use when they take the Attack action. For example, a barbarian 7/monk 7 who takes the Attack action can use the benefits of either the Improved Extra Attack: Barbarian or Improved Extra Attack: Monk feature on that turn (they choose which feature when they make their first attack)."

A hanamori's emotional state can be read on its body: its petals blush darkly when enraged, and the tips of its branches sprout new buds during periods of prolonged grief.

At the perfect time to initiate conflict, the item (or you, if the item is consumable) speaks words chosen to antagonise a potential foe within {@b 100 feet} of it that can hear it. After it has provoked combat in this way (GM's discretion), it can't do so again until you finish a long rest."

If the item is consumable, the creature tries to steal something from you, instead of the item itself. A creature that succeeds on this saving throw is {@b immune} to this property of this item forever."

					"4",

				],
				[
					"5",
					"{@b Cowardly.} The item has enhanced self-preservation tendencies. When you become {@condition frightened}, roll a {@dice d20}. On a {@b 1-10}, the item magically detaches itself from you and flies {@dice 30 feet} directly away from the source of your fear, landing on the ground or colliding with the first creature or object in its path. If the item is consumable, you must instead immediately use your reaction to run as far as you can up to your speed away from the source of your fear."

If you do not, it loses all its magical properties and effects until the end of your next long rest, when it can be fed again and regain the properties. The amount of money depends on the item's rarity: common, 1 cp; uncommon, 1 sp; rare, 1 gp; very rare, 10 gp; legendary, 100 gp; artifact, 1,000 gp."

				],
				[
					"8",

Spells that kill creatures (such as {@spell power word kill|PHB}) fail if you attempt to cast them. If an allied creature attempts to kill another creature in your presence, you must succeed on a {@dc 15} {@b Charisma saving throw} or do everything in your power to prevent the killing. Once you succeed on this saving throw, you automatically succeed on all subsequent saving throws to resist the effect for the next {@b 24 hours}."

				],
				[

				[
					"14",
					"{@b Bungled.} The item squirms under pressure, robbing you of the ability to capitalise on good fortune. When you score a critical hit, it is treated as a normal hit instead. This property can't then trigger again until the next dawn."
				],
				[
					"15",
					"{@b Egotistical.} The item (or you, if the item was consumable) develops extreme egotism. You cannot act as a collaborator for {@variantrule Combo Attacks|RyokoGuideToYokaiRealms}, only initiate them. In addition, you receive no benefit from your {@variantrule Advanced Weapon Masteries|RyokoGuideToYokaiRealms|Advanced Weapon Mastery} features, unless this item is a weapon, in which case you only receive benefits from them with this weapon."

After you hit a creature with an attack roll, you have {@b disadvantage} on attack rolls against any targets other than that creature for {@b 1 minute}, and this property can't trigger again until then. The effect ends early if that creature falls to 0 hit points."
				],
				[

				],
				[
					"18",
					"{@b Negligent.} The item carries a curse of fumbled aid. You automatically fail any attempt to stabilise a creature, and when you do so, that creature takes 1 force damage. Whenever you roll one or more dice to restore hit points with a spell or magic item, you must subtract {@dice 1d4} from the roll."
				],

				[

You have {@b advantage} on attack rolls against creatures who earn more than 50 gold pieces a day, or possess personal wealth in excess of 10,000 gold pieces. You also have {@b disadvantage} on Charisma checks made to interact with such creatures. Each time you first encounter a creature that meets these specifications, you must make a {@dc 15} {@b Charisma saving throw}. On a failure, you reflexively insult it."

When casting lightning bolt or ice moon, it uses Fusionist Spellcasting to create a heavily obscuring steam cloud it can hide behind. It tries to stay out of melee, using its superior movement and misty step to position itself advantageously, but will summon a water wyrm if cornered.

The betobeto-san follows closely behind its quarry, its footsteps echoing into the darkness, but when its victim turns to look, they find themselves to be seemingly alone.

However, in communities where fear is an ever-present spectre, perhaps under the reign of a cruel tyrant or in times of famine and war, these small yokai become corrupted by the persistent atmosphere of dread. Such betobeto-san grow huge as they feast aggressively and without caution, devouring a portion of their victims' souls in the process. These betobeto-sama are cruel and audacious, their mere presence perpetuating the dread that birthed them."

The odour of rot that follows its arrival is the stench of living creatures around the korori that fall prey to its deadly miasma. Only after it detects the scent of rotting flesh does the korori emerge from its hiding place to feed."

							"While kaiju can destroy cities in mere minutes, there is no Monstrosity, Fiend, or Fey that can lay waste to a populace in such a subtle and silent manner as the korori. Its poison twists the mind and senses, inciting harrowing hallucinations and excruciating anguish before death, sparing none, even creatures typically resistant to venoms and toxicants. The korori is considered a harbinger of pestilence, a demon of plague and ruin, and a herald of death and rot by cultures from all corners of the realms. A single korori footprint found on the outskirts of a town is grounds enough for a whole settlement to evacuate immediately."

							"Nue have litters of three to five young every century, and the birth of these young, called nueko, are significant moments. While carrying unborn nueko, mother nue are dangerously aggressive and powerful, their disaster fields growing so potent that they disrupt the weather, generating thick, black clouds that plunge acres of land into perpetual darkness and misfortune. Nueko are highly valued by spellcasters, their gentler nature and charming appearance making them prized familiars. Unlike the nue, whose chimeric body serves a singular, lethal purpose, a nueko's head and tail are independent, often play-fighting with one another and competing for food. Only after a nueko grows into a nue across the first decade of its life do its simian head and serpent tail synchronise into a single mind."

During that time, the creature can use its reaction when it's hit by an attack to intercept it with the shield, causing the attack to miss. The shield is then destroyed. 4 Malfunctioning Fire Lance The senryoka immediately makes a Salvaged Weapon attack. This attack deals piercing damage. Hit or miss, the weapon used to make the attack then explodes, and the target and each creature within 10 feet of it must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 21 ({@damage 6d6}) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
