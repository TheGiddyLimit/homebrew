				"When certain classes reach 5th level, they gain the Extra Attack feature, allowing them to attack twice when they take the Attack action on their turn. The following optional rules give these classes an Improved Extra Attack feature, which is enhanced at 7th level. These features reflect the identity and flavour of each class to emphasise distinct styles. They also give a minor boost in power to classes that primarily make attacks with weapons at a level when spellcasters begin to enjoy unmatched flexibility. Finally, these optional rules add a greater degree of gameplay variation between classes. A fighter and barbarian should feel different to play, right down to the tactics and experience built into their Attack action.",
				"If a character has multiclassed and gained the Improved Extra Attack feature from more than one class, they choose which one to use when they take the Attack action. For example, a barbarian 7/monk 7 who takes the Attack action can use the benefits of either the Improved Extra Attack: Barbarian or Improved Extra Attack: Monk feature on that turn (they choose which feature when they make their first attack)."

A creature that succeeds on this saving throw is {@b immune} to this property of this item forever."

On a {@b 1-10}, the item magically detaches itself from you and flies {@dice 30 feet} directly away from the source of your fear, landing on the ground or colliding with the first creature or object in its path. If the item is consumable, you must instead immediately use your reaction to run as far as you can up to your speed away from the source of your fear."

If an allied creature attempts to kill another creature in your presence, you must succeed on a {@dc 15} {@b Charisma saving throw} or do everything in your power to prevent the killing.

You cannot act as a collaborator for {@variantrule Combo Attacks|RyokoGuideToYokaiRealms}, only initiate them. In addition, you receive no benefit from your {@variantrule Advanced Weapon Masteries|RyokoGuideToYokaiRealms|Advanced Weapon Mastery} features, unless this item is a weapon, in which case you only receive benefits from them with this weapon."

The effect ends early if that creature falls to 0 hit points."

				[
					"18",
					"{@b Negligent.} The item carries a curse of fumbled aid. You automatically fail any attempt to stabilise a creature, and when you do so, that creature takes 1 force damage. Whenever you roll one or more dice to restore hit points with a spell or magic item, you must subtract {@dice 1d4} from the roll."

You have {@b advantage} on attack rolls against creatures who earn more than 50 gold pieces a day, or possess personal wealth in excess of 10,000 gold pieces. You also have {@b disadvantage} on Charisma checks made to interact with such creatures. Each time you first encounter a creature that meets these specifications, you must make a {@dc 15} {@b Charisma saving throw}. On a failure, you reflexively insult it."

It combines the long reach of its glaive with movement-enhancing spells such as longstrider and misty step to conduct devastating hit-and-run tactics. If ambushing a target, the disciple begins combat with longstrider in effect and casts entangle to immobilise foes. On a subsequent turn, it uses either earthen fist or earthen uppercut to knock restrained foes prone. Using its Pole Vaulter trait, it leaps over this difficult terrain to move in for the kill. In retreat, the disciple uses blur and misty step, living to fight another day."

Tales of their loyalty abound, with countless songs and poems lauding their incredible tenacity. In certain parts of the world, adventurers travelling alongside a ko-inari are immediately seen as trustworthy, and not without reason: these creatures are remarkably picky about the company they keep and hold their allies to high standards.

In combat, its role is to position itself within 10 feet of its most vulnerable allies, giving them the benefit of its Aura of Protection and allowing the knight to use its Daring Protector reaction to become the target of melee attacks. Its allies know this and stick close. For those beyond the range of this reaction, it uses the shielding word spell. It restores 50 hit points with its first use of Lay on Hands, saving its final 10 charges to revive a downed ally. When it ambushes a target, the knight casts lifesap aura and earthskin just before springing its trap. Offensively, it casts spirit guardians and positions itself in the midst of its enemies to take advantage of its Shockwave action, weathering any opportunity attacks this repositioning may trigger. If enemies are too scattered for the aforementioned tactics, it targets spellcasters with its attacks and Smite trait. The yojimbo knight is often the last to flee, letting its allies make good their escape."

For the duration, the tarling gains the non-flying speeds of the corpse's original creature and has two pools of hit points: its own and those from the corpse it inhabits. The corpse's pool of hit points equals half the original creature's hit point maximum. Whenever the tarling takes damage, half of the damage is transferred to the corpse and subtracted from that pool of hit points instead of the tarling's.
