Night terrors and other forces of the imagination that prey on the minds of mortals become their prey in turn. The dreams of certain creatures, the legendary beholders among them, can even manifest in reality: and a ranger of this archetype will be waiting to meet them.

In some locales they are known as Believers or Listeners; in others, they are called Nightmare Riders.
