				"At 3rd level, you learn how to craft magical, technologically enhanced gauntlets that make for brutally effective weapons. Creating a pair of these magical gauntlets takes an hour of uninterrupted work, which can coincide with a short or long rest, and requires the use of {@item smith's tools|PHB} and 30 gp of materials. Creating your first pair of gauntlets is free. The gauntlets are specially designed for your body, and are ineffective when used by other creatures. They are considered martial melee weapons with which you are proficient. They deal {@damage 1d8} bludgeoning damage on a hit, have the {@itemProperty L||light} property, and you use your Intelligence modifier for their attack and damage rolls. Also, when you engage in two-weapon fighting with these gauntlets, you can add this modifier to the damage of the secondary attack. Though the gauntlets are magical, they can still be infused.",
				"While wielding these gauntlets, you can activate them as a bonus action. Once you do so, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest. You can also expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher as an alternative way to activate them. If you spend a slot of 2nd level or higher, the first time you hit a creature with the activated gauntlets you deal an additional {@damage 1d8} fire or lightning damage (your choice) to the target for each slot level above 1st.",
				"The gauntlets remain activated for up to 1 minute. When you hit a creature with one of your activated gauntlets, you can choose to have the gauntlet deal an additional {@damage 1d8} fire damage or lightning damage to its target (you choose when you activate the gauntlets). However, when you do so, each of your gauntlets become heated until the end of the turn. If you choose to deal this bonus damage while your gauntlets are heated, they become overheated. This causes the target to take {@damage 3d8} additional fire or lightning damage, rather than {@damage 1d8}, and each creature in a 15-foot cone behind the target must make a Dexterity saving throw against your artificer spell save DC, as heat is expelled from your gauntlets in a blast of energy. A creature takes {@damage 3d8} fire or lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. After your gauntlets overheat, they deactivate and cannot be activated again for the next minute."

By taking some of the ash of an adult male volcanus, combining it with some of the ash of an adult female volcanus, and using fresh lava to set that mixture ablaze, a new volcanus is born after the flames subside. A pair of two volcani has enough ash to sire four children, but most couples only sire two or three.

Married volcani will typically create joint wills, stating potential names for their future children, and how many children they wish to have. Unmarried volcani are expected to donate their ashes their community, so that they might be used for adoption purposes. Another oddity of volcanus culture is the creation of a personal urn, which a volcanus either commissions or forges themself.

Similarly, the spell ends if you ever leave the map's boundaries during the duration.",
				"While the spell lasts, you can stick the golden pin anywhere on the map. As long as the pin is stuck in the map, a golden line marks the most direct route between your current location and the location marked by the pin. This route is conceived using only the information available on the map. When you place the pin, you can mentally choose what information the route should take into account. For example, you could choose to have it prioritize roads, avoid mountains, and avoid water if you are traveling on land. Alternatively, you could have it avoid land if you are traveling by boat. The route suggested by the spell is only as good as the map you're using. If the map is wrong or overly simplistic, the route could end up being wrong as well. You can place the pin as many times as you'd like over the duration."

When a volcanus dies, their body burns to ash\u2014colored a deep black for males and a vibrant red for females. It is from this ash that a volcanus' children are born. By taking some of the ash of an adult male volcanus, combining it with some of the ash of an adult female volcanus, and using fresh lava to set that mixture ablaze, a new volcanus is born after the flames subside. A pair of two volcani has enough ash to sire four children, but most couples only sire two or three.

Married volcani will typically create joint wills, stating potential names for their future children, and how many children they wish to have. Unmarried volcani are expected to donate their ashes their community, so that they might be used for adoption purposes. Another oddity of volcanus culture is the creation of a personal urn, which a volcanus either commissions or forges themself.

						"This appendix contains subclasses that were previously a part of the compendium, before being removed or reworked.",
						"The {@class Cleric|PHB|Elemental Domain|Elemental (Retired)|BDPC} was removed because I wasn't very fond of its mechanics, and felt it didn't fit the compendiums themes very well.",
						"{@class Fighter|PHB|Ember Knight V1|Ember Knight (V1)|BDPC} was reworked to make it less reliant on fire damage, and improve its gameplay.",
						"{@class Fighter|PHB|Ember Knight V2|Ember Knight (V2)|BDPC} was reworked because the first rework strayed too far from the original flavor and thematics, which most people preferred.",
						"The {@class Paladin|PHB|Oath of Cinders|Cinders (Retired)|BDPC} is the previous version of the {@class Paladin|PHB|Oath of Fervor|Fervor|BDPC}. I chose to reflavor and rename this paladin oath, as it didn't feel like a well-flavored oath that someone would take, and was more like a bundle of fire-themed mechanics.",
						"The {@class Paladin|PHB|Oath of Radiance|Radiance (Retired)|BDPC} is the previous version of the {@class Paladin|PHB|Oath of Truth|Truth|BDPC}. Like the {@class Paladin|PHB|Oath of Cinders|Cinders (Retired)|BDPC}, this subclass was renamed and reflavored in order to make it feel more like a real paladin oath vs a bundle of light-themed mechanics.",
						"The {@class Warlock|PHB|Firebird V1|Firebird (V1)|BDPC} was reworked to lessen its reliance on fire damage, just like the {@class Fighter|PHB|Ember Knight|Ember Knight|BDPC} rework.",
						"The {@class Wizard|PHB|School of the Elements|Elements (Retired)|BDPC} is actually a rework of the previous version of the {@class Wizard|PHB|School of Pyromancy|Pyromancy|BDPC}, which was too reliant on fire damage. However, fixing the mechanics required a change in flavor, which made the new version not fit the theme of a \"School of Pyromancy.\"",
						"I included this section of the compendium mainly for historical purposes, and so anyone that was already playing as one of these heavily reworked subclasses can continue referring back to these options for their ongoing campaigns.",
						"Use these subclasses with caution, as they might not be as balanced or well designed as the other subclasses in the compendium. While I intend to fine tune the balance of the subclasses included in Chapter 2 post-release, these subclasses will be kept as is.",
