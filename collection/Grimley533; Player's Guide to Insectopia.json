Individuals accepted into this caste work on the vast pollen fields of their empire or as master wax-craftsmen, creating the building materials for all manner of buildings.",

Moreover, vespoid nations often expand into vast empires and, as such, employ masterfully trained soldiers. These soldiers, in return, swear an oath to protect and grow their nation and are fiercely loyal to their queen.",

These are the rulers, intellectuals, and scholars that shape their nation. At the center of this caste stands the queen, the absolute monarch in most vespidian empires. A queen chooses her successor from one of the comb-schools and raises her as a wise and noble ruler.",
