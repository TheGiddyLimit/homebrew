It's far more believable than alternative systems like exponential (and often unreasonable) time scaling or arbitrary level-locking. These alternatives are mechanically fine, but they feel very much like artificial restrictions (because they are).",

Absolutely\u2014if the group is willing to pay the opportunity cost (i.e. less gold for other things), which has a ripple effect far beyond the boundaries of this system. The more decisions you can hitch to money, the more valuable and interesting money becomes.
