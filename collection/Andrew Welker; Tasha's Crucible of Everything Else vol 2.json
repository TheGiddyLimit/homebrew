While she is often self-serving, she has no qualms accomplishing much good or evil, following whatever course of action suits her plans and mannerisms at the time. Indeed, while she has dealt with devils and worked with demons (with a noted preference for abyssal creatures) she has also been known to ally herself with angels and other beings of the upper planes.",

Gifted with the secrets of immortality, likely by Baba Yaga, Tasha has been intimately involved in numerous important events throughout the history of many worlds. She has cursed and blessed many figures, places, and items, both from her time adventuring as a mortal and through otherwise moving upon the various realities in a multitude of ways. Eventually, she changed her appellation to Iggwilv\u2014a figure of legend who is whispered about, feared, and admired. Those who are aware of her history and her incredible power understand that they only know a fraction of what she has done, and expect to see her involved in future pivotal points as well.",

This undoubtedly stems from the fey influence in her upbringing, which emphasizes the thrill in both giving and receiving in jokes and tricks, and it is a known fact that Tasha could have a higher Intelligence if she wanted to.

If by some chance an adventurer does come into contact with one of her spellbooks, it should be noted that it is certainly only a copy, and likely an abridged one at that.

							"Miniloths are something of an enigma, and might cling to the vilest of characters and endure excessively harsh treatment merely for the smooth comments that they may receive. Miniloths sometimes even retain these relationships on the basis of hope that their master will come around soon and consequently express their appreciation with tearful thanks and bursting accolades. As much as a miniloth wants to be praised in the moment, it has the presence of mind to acknowledge consistency and eventuality so long as they are expected, but will not remain in a situation where it does not see a reward as an eventual likelihood. While the exact terms that spell the loss of a miniloth seem to depend on the individual miniloth to some degree, the most prominent factor appears to be whether or not there are other more powerful servants available. The presence of potentially more useful minions raises the possibility, in the mind of the miniloth, that it will be overlooked in favor of other alternatives. This causes them to be highly suspicious and constantly on edge, though they may not actually leave for some time."
