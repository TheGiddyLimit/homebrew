Perhaps you accidentally killed an innocent civilian that wasn't a magic practitioner at all, maybe you were forced into retirement, or maybe you discovered that your organization's intentions were corrupt and evil.",
					"If you prefer a less foundational backstory, maybe you were the sole survivor of a horrific magical event which hardened your heart against magic and all its users. You strive to destroy magic and those who use it, seeing it as a force none ought to wield due to its destructive potential. Work with your DM to discuss what possible historical event or recurring phenomena involving magic could have tempered a hatred towards the arcane. Perhaps your home was ransacked by an infamous band of bloodthirsty wizards, or maybe someone dear to you was used as a sacrifice in the name of magical research."

					"An eye for mystery, an ear for trouble and a nose to sniff out the answers. Those are the most touted traits of any good sleuth. They are like detectives, but with a penchant for the more unsavory kinds of investigation. Sleuthing originally was a term for animals who had a nose for scents. Nowadays, it means people trying to figure things out. But sleuths do still have that connotation of a lesser kind of investigator, compared to the often state-sanctioned detective. Sleuths are scrappier and work at their own leisure, much like private eyes or private hires, rather than policeman detectives.",
					"When making a character of this background, keep in mind the key feature: curiosity. Sleuths rarely have a good sense of privacy. They'll peep and pry to get down to the bottom of things like sharks to blood. Their own lives are often second to an investigation, meaning many of them are quite reckless and meet some ill-fated end. However, that is not to say all sleuths follow their noses without a brain. Sleuths are best known for their deductive thinking capabilities and questioning faculties, which is what keeps the wheels turning and the plot thickening. Mysteries are their daily bread and butter.",
					"When making a sleuth character, ask yourself these questions: What prompted your character down this path of investigation? Justice? Pure curiosity? What was the biggest discovery your character ever made in their career? Or is this just some side hobby to amuse their boredom? Do you dive straight into a good story, or do you like to take a step back and wait for more clues to appear? Do you even care if you're peeping in a bath or snooping in someone else's house? "

Perhaps it was a habit which you grew into, rather than something that ill-circumstances forced you into.

Maybe you were employed by evildoers to clean up their dirty work, or maybe you overheard conversations within the imperial halls where you've worked. This kind of special environment may have been a starting point for your sense of adventure; but at heart, you simply began by being the local handyman.",

As they work to do good in the world, blesslings form strong friendships\u2014both with those they have helped, and with others who share their benevolent perspective. If nothing else, one could assume that blesslings enjoy the safety that companionship brings.",

Blesslings know several songs that work a variety of helpful magic, from repairing the injured to guiding the lost. They do not only choose to affect the world through magic, however. A blessling knows the healing power of a cheerful song, or an act of kindness.",

Sadly, their tiny immortal bodies are anything but durable, and their calling to help creatures in need brings them close to dangerous situations. A blessling will usually keep its distance from situations where it might come to harm, such as active battles, preferring to drift in when the danger is gone and give aid to the survivors. But many are not so lucky, and a single blow could banish the power of the defenseless celestial."

					"The bloom crawler is an unusual plant that bears an uncanny resemblance to a toad. They are strong and hardy creatures that often choose to ignore fights they're capable of winning. Left to itself, a bloom crawler uses its power of locomotion to follow the sun, always staying where the light is most direct. They trample meandering trails through their forests, and unwary travelers may find themselves following a bloom crawler in circles, mistakenly assuming they've found a game trail. ",
					"{@b {@i Diverse Diet.}}  Bloom crawlers get nearly all of their energy from sunlight, but as they follow the sun they also graze indiscriminately, swallowing grass and soil alike. They use viney tendrils to smack bugs out of the air around them, devouring anything that sticks to the vines. Oddly, they can't digest the seeds of fruit or other vegetation, and instead carry them alongside its own seeds.",
					"{@b {@i Vegetative Defenses.}}  Being energetic piles of vegetation, bloom crawlers sometimes must defend themselves against creatures that would nibble on them. Instead of using the force of its full body, or its toothy maw, a bloom crawler uses its vine tendrils to rapidly whip enemies. It can also spit its seeds with great force, which is useful in propagating its species but also serves as a weapon that dissuades most threats.",
					"{@b {@i Animal Helpers.}}  Although they can fend off most large herbivores, bloom crawlers often find themselves overwhelmed by insects they simply can't manage. Bloom crawlers encourage birds to visit their leaves to help eat the bugs that vex them, creating a partnership that benefits both. More intelligent creatures have learned to take advantage of this need, learning that the bloom crawler will follow any creature that helps it clean its leaves. Some communities of wood elves have used this trick to gather bloom crawlers into semi-domesticated herds."

					"{@b {@i Mousers.}}  Cats passionately hunt small animals such as birds, rodents, lizards, and large insects. This makes them useful pets in places where humanoids have trouble keeping vermin under control, like farms, granaries, market stalls, gardens, or anywhere they cause damage. Cats hunt by stealth, relying on their keen hearing and smell to find prey. Their eyes can see in near darkness, and they are most active in the twilight hours.",
					"{@b {@i Risky Agility.}}  Cats have a reputation for getting into trouble with their curiosity, and out of it again with their quick reflexes, guile, and sheer luck. Cats are famous for their ability to land feet-first. A cat that falls more than a few feet will right itself in the air, landing on its feet and rarely suffering any harm, even after falling from great heights. Legend speaks of a wizard who tied two cats together, back-to-back, causing them to rapidly spin in the air to generate power for their rituals."

By the time Dhurge was fully grown, he has discovered more wands than his hands could carry and had mastered their use. The arcane casting didn't go down well with the sahuagin of Kressilacc, Dhurge's home, so he headed south to the Nelanthers where he knew he could find work as a pirate. Here he was approached by Sea King Tentrix, who recruited him into the Black Armada.",

Any creature to best a feluros has earned its right into the guarded domain, and any creature that attempts to flee will be hunted mercilessly. In their time as guardians, a feluros occasionally finds a creature who they consider a superior, and are inclined to join them."

Luckily for the most vain of adventurers, Ladro the Avaricious has decided to put the instructions and ingredients for this ritual on the market: for more than a pretty copper, naturally. Each fetchen is entirely unique, and entirely tied to its creator's existence.",
					"{@b {@i Tethered by Fate.}}  A fetchen's existence is no more than an extension of its creator. It cannot act or think without some semblance of direction, and dies the instant its master is slain. As a part of the ritual, detailed below, the very life force of its maker is a vital ingredient.",
					"{@b {@i Incomplete Design.}}  To the dismay of some adventurers, the fetchen can't replicate its creator's face, and its visage is devoid of features. It is unable to communicate using anything more than gestures, and lacks complete intelligence. A number of refunds have been attempted after rather embarrassing actions were performed by a fetchen.",
					"{@b {@i Ladro's Homunkit.}}  The instructions for creating a fetchen are detailed extensively in the \"kit\" produced by Ladro. 1 cubic foot of clay-like matter, provided by the kit, must be infused with the blood of a humanoid with at least 10 hit points. The process of creating the fetchen reduces the creator's hit point maximum by 1 hit die, and the fetchen gains health equal to the maximum amount that die can roll (or 4 hit points, whichever is higher). This health is returned to its creator if the fetchen is killed.",
					"The material must then be placed into a waterskin, a clay or leather egg, or a glass container. After two weeks, the fetchen grows to the size of the chamber (ranging from \u2014 foot to 2 feet tall). It then emerges from the egg, wearing clothing identical to the clothing its master wore when creating it. If the clothing grants the creator an AC bonus, the fetchen also gains that bonus (up to +4). Their statistics are also based on their creator, gaining the following ability scores, assigned from highest to lowest, in the same order as their creator's ability scores ranked from highest to lowest: 14, 12, 10, 10, 8, 6.",
					"The fetchen's speed equals half of their creator's speed, and they gain any senses their creator currently has. The homunkit also provides an assortment of tiny weapons, each one capable of dealing 1d4 damage: a shortsword, a handaxe, a warhammer, and a shortbow (with a range of 10/25 feet)."

					"A gellump is the smallest of oozes, little more than a sticky and corrosive glob. They can be found on deep cave walls, where they seem to bead up like condensation. Gellumps can move slowly, but seldom want to. In the wild they feed on insects that land on them, tricked by the gellump's natural transparency and slightly sweet odor.",
					"Gellumps make good pets for those with low expectations. They can be held securely in an oiled container, or stuck on a piece of metal armor, and fed the occasional scrap of food. They sometimes make a bubbling sound while feeding, which is somewhat reminiscent of purring.",
					"{@b {@i Sticky, Hungry.}}  The gellump's two main features make for an unpleasant combination. First, they adhere to any surface that isn't first rubbed down with oil. Second, they slowly dissolve any organic matter they come in contact with. It is generally advised to avoid direct contact with skin. Contact a cleric immediately if swallowed, and keep them away from children.",
					"{@b {@i Aerodynamic.}}  One way that a gellump surpasses most other pets is as a projectile; in a pinch, throwing the acidic wad of goo in an enemy's face is a handy distraction. A gellump tends to stay in a dense, roughly cubicle form. When thrown, they reform into oval shaped discs, making them easy to throw far and accurately.",
					"{@b {@i Combination.}}  Gellumps always face a scarcity of food, and prefer to stay tiny to preserve fuel. However, with an abundance of food, one can combine with other gellumps to form a larger ooze. Experiments have found that, with a massive offering of warm food, any number of gellumps that reach the area can form a single and gargantuan unit. If enough of them group together, they suddenly transform into a well-known cubic threat that haunts many dungeons. In retrospect, those experiments were a bad idea."

They re-forge scrap metal into tools and weapons, and sew discarded rags into exquisite clothing.

Grimalkinn who leave their clans often find employment as cooks on dangerous expeditions, using their native culinary skills to conjure delicious meals out of unlikely ingredients.",

Grimalkinn who go back on their word or abandon their duty find themselves cast out from their clan and forced to seek a living among the other races. Such outcasts often find companionship, and a familiar focus on honor, in the military structure of mercenary bands, where they make themselves indispensable in and out of battle."

This is the loftus, a wandering enigma spreading knowledge across the realms.",
					"A loftus can live for centuries, blooming with more blossoms each successive year. The younger specimens are more often found on the material plane, as they gather knowledge by observing different realities. Travelers to distant planes may encounter the oldest of loftuses, massive and crowned with hundreds of flowers. When a loftus has learned the deepest secrets of the multiverse, it returns to its celestial home to finally take root and share its knowledge with other celestials.",
					"{@b {@i Wise and Mysterious.}}  A loftus is a gatherer of wisdom, and many sages have sought them out to ask them questions. However, all who seek them come away disappointed: because a loftus never answers questions. A loftus understands that it is wiser to seek and experience answers than to simply hear them. However, a truly attentive listener may be able to gain insight from the loftus' incisive questions.",
					"{@b {@i Shielded Mind.}}  True to what they represent, their wisdom is as elusive as an elder loftus. Each loftus is protected by magical inscrutability, and none of its secrets can be forcefully taken. Although its thoughts and emotions bear much greater weight than other creatures, none can discern its feelings, even by magical means.",
					"{@b {@i Wind Drifters.}}  The slow, meandering path a loftus follows would imply that they simply ride whatever breeze blows them forward. In fact, all loftus can exert control over the air around them. This magical breeze takes them wherever they like, and can even carry the loftus across planar boundaries. A loftus can use this control over wind in other ways as well, such as to move objects or protect itself."

The reason for the aggressive nature of the merfolk has been speculated about by sailors for perhaps hundreds of years, but few know the truth. Red Rocks was once a kraken hatchery, where the monolithic beasts stored their eggs. The local merfolk were corrupted by the evil influence of the leviathans and were forced to serve as guards and caretakers for the newly born krakens. Although no eggs have been left here for centuries, the merfolk still pledge allegiance to the krakens, specifically to Slarkrethel."

Because of this, an octopus can squeeze through any space its beak can fit through, compressing the rest of its body to an alarming degree. Captive octopuses frequently escape their enclosures, no matter how secure their keepers think they are.",

They are able to use objects as tools, or build simple shelters from their surroundings. Much of the octopus' mind and thoughts are given to controlling its eight arms, which move and even think independently of one another.

However, facing a full armada of these small creatures can prove to be an unexpected danger."

Rabbits raised among humanoids can be surprisingly tolerant of creatures they would flee in the wild, such as cats, dogs, and other humanoids.",
					"Rabbits in the wild tend to live in large groups, and most live in extensive underground burrows called warrens. These convoluted networks of tunnels can stretch underground for miles, piercing the walls of caves and dungeons alike.",
					"{@b {@i Rabbit Lore.}}  Rabbits are said to enjoy a rich tradition of legends and stories which they pass down across generations. Every warren contains at least one rabbit who can recount the history of their species' creation, and recall the right story to lift the other rabbits' spirits in dark times. Some legends even say rabbits came from the moon during a particularly starry night.",
					"{@b {@i Symbols of Luck.}}  Rabbits are a particular favorite of trickster deities and their associated heroes, who respect the rabbit's ability to avoid consequences and enemies alike. The gods have blessed rabbits with a greater than normal share of luck. However, rabbits can only avail themselves of that luck because they are eternally vigilant for enemies. Some humanoids suppose that they can avail themselves of a rabbit's luck by carrying a rabbit's foot, but it stands to reason that a lucky rabbit would have been able to avoid such a grim fate."

					"Some creatures' loyalty to their humanoid friends persists after their death. A renine is the spirit of an exceptionally loyal creature that was separated from its master and died before finding them again. The unfinished search binds the renine to the realm of the living, forever tied to its master. A renine appears as a ghostly image of the creature it was in life, albeit translucent and often floating above the ground. If obstructed in its search, the renine can fight with the ferocity and determination of a living creature. More often, though, renines are incorporeal and elusive, perceptible only by the sound of a distant whimper.",
					"{@b {@i Reunion.}}  As a spirit, a renine continues its search for as long as needed until it and its master are reunited. In other regards it behaves as it did in life. If a renine does not know where to look for its missing master, it may follow someone who reminds it of its master. Such pairings are temporary, however, and the renine never gives up its search.",
					"When a renine finds its master alive, it tries to rejoin them and accompany them once again. A welcomed renine will never spend even a moment away from its old friend, persisting until its master's final breath. Once that happens, the renine then passes to the next world along with the master's spirit. If the master is dead when the renine finds them, the renine instead becomes an eternal guardian of their resting place.",
					"{@b {@i Rejection.}}  The most horrible fate for a renine is to find its old master and be turned away. When this happens, the renines spirit completely changes to one of fear, hatred, and retribution. First, it will attack its old master and any of their allies or companions. Thereafter it becomes a scourge to the old master's kind, wandering the night and assaulting the living with eternal cries, forever mourning its rejection."

					"A feared hunter of remote savannas, these tatzelwurms are smaller and swifter than their mountain-dwelling cousins. Taking features from both hunting snakes and cheetahs, they can run down and launch themselves at almost any prey. They prefer to kill quickly with a single bite, rarely hunting game that might notice them or fight back. Most frighteningly, savanna tatzelwurms are nearly silent, even when moving at full speed. Their cry, when they make a sound, is a piercing hiss.",
					"{@b {@i Transient Attachments.}}  Savanna tatzelwurms are territorial, annually coming together to mate and raise young before separating again. In their solitary periods they can form connections with members of other species who they do not consider threats. It is uncommon for savanna tatzelwurms to hunt humanoids, and some may even befriend one if the promise of consistent prey is made. Expert hunters may spend years watching a tatzelwurm, learning from a master of its craft, and some barbarian tribes hold up savanna tatzelwurms as their totem. Young hunters may prove themselves by seeking out a tatzelwurm and surviving the encounter.",
					"{@b {@i Threads of History.}}  Many scholars have entertained possible ways that these creatures came to be. The most common assumption ties them to crafty wizards that grafted animals together, forming dangerous hunters on a whim. Others have examined their scale formation and shedding, noting exceptional similarities between tatzelwurms and dragons. This connection is reinforced by the authority these creatures have over their homes, and the fear they incite in the hearts of those that live near them."

Their shapes and mannerisms resemble their originals so closely that it's easy to identify who a given silhouette came from.",
					"The first silhouettes manifested from the bodies of creatures that crossed into a darker world, and died without ever truly understanding themselves. The energy of this phenomenon has spread across the Material Plane, and now affects creatures seemingly at random. Some creatures choose to keep silhouettes as low-risk companions, as a shadowy undead puppy has fewer needs than a living one.",
					"{@b {@i Life Draining.}}  Silhouettes feed by unconsciously draining the life of living creatures they come close to. They are light feeders, and do not seriously weaken most healthy creatures. In self-defense, they use this ability more aggressively to weaken an attacker.",
					"{@b {@i Sunlight Aversion.}}  Silhouettes fear direct sunlight. Their shadowy presence cannot persist under the divine daylight, and they slowly become gray silhouettes over the course of an hour before fading to dust. Their allies must provide solutions to this problem, such as umbrellas or carrying boxes."

A side-effect of this ability is a very good sense of direction; however, they become bewildered in the presence of strong magnetic disturbances. They have been known to accidentally swarm in wild magic zones, where their polarity is thrown wildly off course.",

Even so, tarnishers enjoy stockpiling as much iron as they can to eat later. A tarnisher den may be piled with scrap that can feed its inhabitants for years. No matter how much they have in reserve, however, tarnishers never stop gathering more.",
					"{@b {@i Urban Pests.}}  Tarnishers gather in cities where artisans produce and discard large quantities of digestible iron objects such as nails. Smaller, friendlier, and less ravenous than their cousins, these creatures have an easier time coexisting with humanoids. Some people even find them charming, and enjoy a tarnisher's enthusiasm for a snack of scrap metal. Tarnishers raised from hatchlings can be kept as pets, and even feral ones are friendly to anyone who feeds them. With a bag of ball bearings, one can pass a pleasant afternoon in a back alley feeding the neighborhood tarnishers."

They often fashion their trophies into armor, wearing stolen rings around their necks or beating gold coins into heavy breastplates. This cobbled-together armor does not impede their agility at all, although the reflective metals may jeopardize their stealth. Their quick thinking and knowledgeable stealth patterns make them unintentional teachers to less experienced rogues."

When a thisschord plays its lyre softly, it fills the minds of creatures who hear it with murderous thoughts. When it plays its lyre loudly, the resulting cacophony can drive mortals into endless madness. Thisschords have a special knack for turning companions to enemies, and escalating disputes into riots.",

Their twisted, fiendish songs become offensive to reality itself. Such a bard's music becomes much more powerful, and together with the thisschord they can stir wickedness in even the purest hearts. Following this path, however, gradually drives goodness out of the bard's soul as they come to embrace the thisschord's songs. When they have truly mastered the music of malice, an infernal lyre appears for them, fashioned in the depths of the abyss, and a new thisschord is born."

They have learned to rend the hulls of large ships and capsize smaller ones to get to their favourite prey. Perhaps the most peculiar feature of the vodyanoi is its stomach.

Long-term hosts of the creature become increasingly absent-minded, ironically causing the parasites to lose interest in them.

They swell with the knowledge they consume, however, and a well-fed wizard's parasite may become conspicuous.",

Some wizards have preserved parasites that they claim have survived for millennia, and which they believe contain fragments of knowledge from sages lost to history.

All available nautiloid space was dedicated to the illithid, and their thralls were jettisoned to make room for the superior race. The need for brains to fuel the mind flayers meant that the nautiloid in which the colony lived was visiting the Material Plane ever more frequently. Despite generations of tactical warfare knowledge assimilated by the Zellix'Phor, his arrogance became his downfall. The gith had been tracking the nautiloid across the Planes, waiting for the right time to strike. Believing himself invincible, Zellix'Phor commanded the vessel to dock on the Material Plane to stock up on brains, and the ship was attacked.",

They entered the vessel as assassins and decimated the illithid within. Without their thralls to take the brunt of the assault, the mind flayers were on the front line, and despite their formidable psionic capabilities, many were struck down by the silver swords of the Githyanki. The nautiloid crash-landed on the Northlander Isle of Gundarlun, killing nearly all aboard. Unfortunately, Zellix'Phor and his closest attendants managed to survive, sheltered from the destruction in the elder brain chamber of the nautiloid. As far as the githyanki are concerned, the suicide mission was a success."

These formidable beings are the result of a sinister process that merges the essence of dragons and the lingering specter of the undead. The origins of the Draconic Revenants can be traced back to a time when desperate and ambitious sorcerers sought to harness the immense power of dragons, transcending the boundaries of mortality itself. ",
							"Legend has it that these sorcerers delved deep into the forbidden tomes of necromancy and sought the arcane knowledge required to awaken dormant draconic spirits and bind them to the ethereal remains of the undead. Through a complex and treacherous ritual, they called upon the very essence of dragons and forced them into an unholy union with the necrotic remnants of deceased creatures. ",
							"It is whispered that the earliest Draconic Revenants were created during a time of great upheaval, when dark empires vied for dominion and sought to wield the immense power of dragons as their ultimate weapon. These necromantic sorcerers, driven by their insatiable thirst for power and domination, sought to manipulate the forces of life and death to their advantage. ",
							"The process of creating a Draconic Revenant is an intricate and dangerous one, involving the mastery of both draconic magic and necromantic arts. The sorcerers carefully selected deceased creatures whose souls still clung to the material plane, using their remains as the vessel for the ritual. Through an elaborate series of incantations, arcane circles, and sacrificial offerings, they managed to bridge the gap between life and death, merging the essence of dragons with the lingering specter of the undead. ",
							"Upon the completion of the ritual, the dormant draconic spirits were awakened, their powers fused with the necrotic energy of the undead. The result was a creature that retained the physical characteristics and elemental affinity of their draconic ancestors, but also possessed the unnerving resilience and necrotic powers of the undead. The once-sleeping dragon blood surged through the veins of the newly formed Draconic Revenant, infusing them with a potent blend of raw draconic might and deathly magic. ",
							"As word of these abominable creations spread, fear and awe gripped the realms. Many viewed the Draconic Revenants as an abhorrent perversion of nature and an affront to the divine order. They were shunned and hunted by those who saw them as a blight upon the world, a mockery of both dragonkind and the sanctity of life. Others, however, saw their potential as powerful allies or feared adversaries, recognizing the unique blend of powers they possessed. ",
							"Throughout history, tales of the Draconic Revenants have been woven into the fabric of legends and folklore. They are often depicted as tragic figures, torn between their draconic heritage and the burden of undeath. Some seek to reclaim their lost humanity, striving to redeem themselves from the abomination they have become. Others revel in the dark powers bestowed upon them, embracing their dual nature as both dragon and undead.",
							"In the present day, the presence of Draconic Revenants is a rare and ominous sight. They walk the realms as beings of both fascination and dread, often cloaked in mystery and surrounded by whispered rumors. Adventurers who encounter these formidable creatures must tread carefully, for their allegiance is uncertain, and their motives can be as fickle as the shifting winds. ",
							"Thus, the origins and histories of the Draconic Revenants remain shrouded in darkness, their true purpose and ultimate fate yet to be unveiled. As they continue to stride through the realms, their stories intertwine with those of heroes and villains alike, leaving an indelible mark upon the tapestry of the world and serving as a reminder of the potent forces that lie beyond the mortal realm."

							"Standing tall and proud, Draconic Revenants possess a commanding presence that demands attention. They often exceed the average height of a human, with their draconic lineage manifesting in their regal posture and a sense of innate authority. Their physical forms exhibit a remarkable blend of draconic and undead traits, making them instantly recognizable as beings forged from two distinct worlds. ",
							"One of the most striking features of a Draconic Revenant is their scales. Resembling those of their dragon ancestors, these scales come in a wide array of vibrant colors, ranging from the brilliant iridescence of metallic hues to the deep, ominous shades of chromatic scales. Each scale is tough and resilient, serving as a natural armor that protects the Draconic Revenant from harm. ",
							"Their eyes, shining with an otherworldly glow, are often reminiscent of the dragon type they are linked to. Fiery red orbs hint at a connection to the ferocious red dragons, while piercing blue or green eyes reflect a bond with their chromatic counterparts. These eyes possess an intensity that can unsettle even the bravest of souls, hinting at the depths of power and wisdom hidden within. ",
							"Draconic Revenants bear a strong resemblance to the humanoids from which their undead forms were forged, yet their features possess an otherworldly refinement. Their visage exudes an aura of ethereal beauty, even in the case of those whose dragon lineage is tied to creatures traditionally considered monstrous. It is as though the melding of dragon and undead has elevated their physical form to a higher state of grace. ",
							"A notable feature of Draconic Revenants is the presence of draconic wings, sprouting majestically from their backs. These wings, a symbol of their draconic heritage, possess a grandeur that rivals those of their full-blooded dragon kin. While not all Draconic Revenants possess wings, those who do can effortlessly take to the skies, soaring with an otherworldly grace that is both awe-inspiring and intimidating. ",
							"In addition to their striking appearance, Draconic Revenants possess an unnatural resilience that stems from their undead nature. They are immune to diseases and poisons, and their bodies are remarkably resistant to the ravages of time. This resilience grants them a supernatural endurance, allowing them to withstand injuries that would incapacitate or kill a mortal being. ",
							"While Draconic Revenants retain humanoid forms, they possess a strength and physical prowess that surpasses that of most mortal creatures. Their bodies are honed by draconic power, granting them exceptional agility, speed, and dexterity. This, combined with their inherent resistance to harm, makes them formidable adversaries in combat, capable of delivering devastating blows and shrugging off the most lethal of attacks. ",
							"However, their undead nature comes with a price. Draconic Revenants do not breathe or require sustenance, and their hearts remain still within their chests. This lack of life force renders them immune to effects that target the living, but it also means they are cut off from the joys and necessities of mortal existence. They are forever bound to the realm of the undead, caught between life and death, their existence fueled by the lingering energy of dragons and necromantic forces."

							"At the heart of Draconic Revenant society lies a deep reverence for their draconic heritage. They cherish the memories and tales of their dragon ancestors, seeking to uphold the ideals and values associated with these legendary beings. Dragons are viewed as paragons of power, wisdom, and dominance, and Draconic Revenants strive to embody these qualities in their own lives. ",
							"The society of Draconic Revenants is often organized into distinct clans or broods, each tracing its lineage back to a particular type of dragon. These clans form the bedrock of their social structure, providing a sense of belonging and shared identity. Each clan operates with its own hierarchy, led by an elder or chieftain who embodies the essence and wisdom of their respective dragon ancestor.",

Draconic Revenants pay homage to their dragon lineage through offerings, prayers, and acts of devotion. These rituals serve as a means to strengthen their connection to their draconic heritage and reinforce their ties to the realms of dragons and the undead. ",

They seek to amass wisdom and arcane understanding, delving into ancient tomes and exploring the mysteries of the realms. Libraries and sanctuaries dedicated to the accumulation and preservation of knowledge are revered spaces within their society. It is through the pursuit of knowledge that Draconic Revenants hope to unlock the secrets of their existence and transcend the limitations imposed upon them by their dual nature. ",
							"Honorable combat holds great significance in Draconic Revenant culture. They believe in the power of physical prowess and the demonstration of martial skill. Ritualistic duels and contests of strength are common, serving not only as a means of resolving disputes but also as a form of entertainment and a way to prove oneself within the society. Such contests are often accompanied by intricate displays of martial arts, magical prowess, and the unleashing of draconic powers. ",
							"Given their unique abilities and connection to the undead, Draconic Revenants often find themselves navigating the delicate balance between the realms of life and death. They possess a profound respect for the cycle of existence and the mysteries that lie beyond mortal understanding. Funerary rites and ceremonies hold deep importance for them, as they commemorate the passing of both their own kind and other creatures. These rituals serve as a reminder of the impermanence of life and the eternal nature of the soul. ",
							"While Draconic Revenants are capable of forming alliances and bonds with other races, their society is often insular and cautious. They are acutely aware of the prejudice and fear that their existence can evoke in others, and thus, they tend to keep their true nature hidden from those who may not understand or accept them. As a result, Draconic Revenant communities are often hidden away in remote and secretive locations. ",
							"The notion of honor and loyalty holds great sway in Draconic Revenant culture. They value oaths and commitments, and breaking one's word is seen as a grave offense. Trust and loyalty are paramount within their society, and betrayal is met with swift and severe consequences. Despite their undead nature, Draconic Revenants hold themselves to a strict code of conduct, striving to maintain their dignity and honor amidst the shadows that surround them."

							"The origins of Half-Fiends can be traced back to the forbidden unions between mortals and fiends, resulting in a unique and enigmatic hybrid. The very nature of their existence embodies the clash of two disparate realms\u2014the mortal plane and the infernal dominions. While their origins are steeped in secrecy and often shrouded in dark tales, it is believed that such unions occur when mortals, driven by their desires, form unholy pacts or succumb to the temptations of the fiendish entities. ",
							"The histories of Half-Fiends are as diverse as the multitudes of fiends that roam the planes of existence. Each individual Half-Fiend carries their own story, often marked by tragedy, struggle, or inner turmoil. Some Half-Fiends are born out of unions orchestrated by ambitious cultists seeking to bring forth powerful offspring, while others are the result of ill-fated love affairs or diabolical experiments conducted by nefarious beings. ",
							"In the annals of history, tales of Half-Fiends have emerged from all corners of the world. Legends tell of a noble knight who, in a moment of weakness, gave in to the seductions of a succubus, thus birthing a Half-Fiend heir who would eventually strive to redeem their tainted bloodline. Another story recounts a sorceress who bargained with a powerful devil, exchanging her soul for supernatural power, only to find herself pregnant with a Half-Fiend child that would grow up torn between their mortal heritage and infernal legacy. ",
							"The treatment of Half-Fiends within societies varies greatly, reflecting the prevailing beliefs and prejudices of each culture. In some realms, Half-Fiends are feared and reviled, regarded as abominations and carriers of evil. They are often driven into the shadows, forced to conceal their true nature and face a life of persecution and mistrust. Alternatively, in more cosmopolitan societies, Half-Fiends may find a semblance of acceptance, albeit with wary eyes and lingering suspicion. Here, they may attempt to carve out a place for themselves, navigating the delicate balance between their mortal upbringing and their fiendish inclinations. ",
							"Despite their tumultuous origins and often challenging paths, Half-Fiends possess inherent potential for greatness. The infusion of fiendish blood grants them unique abilities and powers, both physically and magically. Their physical traits bear the mark of their dual heritage, manifesting as horns, fangs, or darkened skin. The innate demonic abilities they possess can include the power to summon minor fiendish creatures, resist the effects of certain spells, or even unleash infernal flames upon their enemies."

							"The physical characteristics of Half-Fiends bear the unmistakable marks of their dual lineage, blending the traits of mortals and fiends into a visage that is both fascinating and unsettling. While there can be significant variations among individuals, certain characteristics commonly manifest within this unique race. ",
							"The most notable feature of Half-Fiends is their infernal heritage, which often reveals itself through physical attributes that mirror those of their fiendish parent. These traits can include small, curved horns protruding from the forehead, giving them an unmistakable demonic aura. In some cases, the horns may be more pronounced, resembling the magnificent curves of a ram or the sharp ridges of a devil. These horns, while distinct, do not hinder the Half-Fiend's ability to wear headgear or helmets. ",
							"Another prevalent characteristic is the presence of leathery, bat-like wings extending from their backs. These wings, although not fully functional for sustained flight, grant Half-Fiends the ability to glide gracefully through the air, allowing for swift descents or short aerial movements. The coloration and texture of the wings can vary widely, ranging from sleek, obsidian-like membranes to mottled patterns reminiscent of the fiendish parent's specific lineage. ",
							"The eyes of Half-Fiends often captivate observers with their intense and unsettling gaze. Their eyes can possess vibrant and piercing colors, such as fiery red, glowing yellow, or icy blue, reflecting the fiendish essence within. Some Half-Fiends have eyes with elongated pupils or slitted irises, lending an otherworldly appearance that unnerves those who meet their gaze. These eyes radiate an eerie presence, hinting at the depths of darkness that lurk within their souls. ",
							"In addition to these striking features, Half-Fiends often exhibit physical attributes that reflect their fiendish nature. Their skin may possess a subtle, dark hue, reminiscent of shadow or obsidian, or it may bear intricate patterns or markings that evoke their infernal lineage. The texture of their skin can range from smooth and flawless to rough and scaly, resembling the hide of a fiendish creature. ",
							"While Half-Fiends maintain a humanoid form, some individuals develop other fiendish traits as they mature. Among these characteristics is the presence of a prehensile tail, which can be used for balance or even as a weapon in combat. The tail varies in length and thickness, and it often possesses a bony or spiky appendage at the tip, capable of delivering painful strikes. ",
							"Height and build among Half-Fiends largely follow the spectrum of mortal races, with variations depending on their mortal lineage. However, it is not uncommon for Half-Fiends to possess a lean and athletic build, combining both agility and strength. Their physical prowess often exceeds that of a typical mortal, granting them an advantage in combat situations.",
							"It is important to note that the physical appearance of Half-Fiends can be influenced by their mortal heritage as well. Depending on the race of their mortal parent, Half-Fiends may retain certain physical traits associated with that race, such as the pointed ears of elves or the burly frames of dwarves. This interplay of mortal and fiendish characteristics adds further depth and uniqueness to each Half-Fiend's appearance."

While Half-Fiends often find themselves at odds with the world around them, they have developed their own distinct customs and social dynamics within the realms they call home. ",
							"Half-Fiends, due to their unique lineage and physical characteristics, are often viewed with a mix of fascination, fear, and prejudice by the societies in which they reside. Their presence can evoke superstitions and deep-rooted beliefs about their connection to darkness and evil. As a result, Half-Fiends frequently face challenges in finding acceptance and understanding among both mortals and fiends. However, their tenacity and resilience have allowed them to establish their own cultural customs, creating a sense of belonging among their kind. ",
							"One of the defining aspects of Half-Fiend society is the emphasis on individualism and self-reliance. From a young age, Half-Fiends are often forced to navigate a world that rejects or fears them. This experience fosters an independent spirit and a strong sense of self determination. Half-Fiends prize personal power and agency, recognizing that their survival and success depend primarily on their own capabilities. As a result, they tend to be self-sufficient and are known for their resourcefulness in the face of adversity. ",
							"While Half-Fiends may lack a unified society or a centralized governing body, they often form loose communities or enclaves where they can find solace and support among their peers. These enclaves serve as safe havens, where Half-Fiends can express themselves without fear of judgment or persecution. Within these communities, individuals share their experiences, exchange knowledge, and offer assistance to one another, forming strong bonds built on a shared understanding of the challenges they face. ",
							"Despite their independent nature, Half-Fiends also understand the importance of unity and mutual protection. They recognize the advantages of forming alliances and establishing networks of trust. These alliances can take various forms, ranging from loose affiliations based on shared goals or interests to more organized groups that collaborate to promote the welfare of Half-Fiends as a whole. These alliances often extend beyond racial boundaries, as Half-Fiends may seek common cause with other marginalized or outcast groups in society. ",
							"Religion and spirituality play complex roles within Half-Fiend society. Some Half-Fiends reject religious beliefs altogether, viewing themselves as outside the influence of divine or infernal powers. Others embrace their infernal heritage, revering fiendish deities or paying homage to the darker forces of the cosmos. Conversely, there are those who seek to atone for their fiendish blood, aligning themselves with gods of light and redemption. The diversity of spiritual practices among Half-Fiends reflects their individual paths of self-discovery and the ongoing struggle to reconcile their dual natures. ",
							"The role of leadership and governance within Half-Fiend society varies significantly. Some enclaves are governed by charismatic leaders who have earned the respect and trust of their peers through their accomplishments and wisdom. These leaders provide guidance and make decisions based on the consensus of the community. In other cases, Half-Fiends reject traditional forms of leadership and opt for a more egalitarian approach, where decisions are made collectively, and power is distributed among all members. This dynamic ensures that every voice is heard, and that no individual dominates the community."

The artificers, drawing upon the essence of Hell, infuse these crafted bodies with infernal energy, forging them into living conduits of dark power. ",

As the forces of Hell waged their eternal conflicts, seeking dominion over both the mortal realms and rival planes, the artificers sought to create a superior breed of soldiers. With the ability to withstand immense punishment and channel the very fires of Hell, the Hellforged were envisioned as the ultimate weapons of destruction. ",

Some Hellforged exhibit more angular and imposing features, reminiscent of gothic architecture, while others possess sleek and streamlined designs, reflecting a more modern aesthetic. ",

							"While the Hellforged may be creatures born of darkness, they are not inherently evil. They possess a range of moral alignments and individual ethics. Some Hellforged are driven by a desire for power and dominion, embracing their infernal nature and seeking to expand their influence. Others, however, strive to break free from their origins, pursuing personal redemption, and using their unique abilities for noble causes. The societal expectations and cultural customs of the Hellforged provide a framework for these diverse moral perspectives to coexist, allowing for both individuality and collective growth. ",
							"Rites and rituals hold a significant place in Hellforged culture, serving as conduits for communal bonding and personal growth. These ceremonies often involve the invocation of infernal energies, the recitation of ancient incantations, or the symbolic act of forging and repairing their own bodies. Rites of passage mark important milestones in a Hellforged's life, such as the awakening of their infernal powers or the mastery of a specific skill. These rituals are typically attended by fellow Hellforged, reinforcing a sense of shared heritage and purpose. ",
							"In the wider world, Hellforged often find themselves navigating a society that views them with suspicion and trepidation. This external perception shapes their cultural customs, encouraging them to remain vigilant, prove their worth, and work towards dispelling misconceptions. Some Hellforged choose to conceal their true nature, adopting disguises or integrating themselves into mortal societies, while others embrace their intimidating appearance, using it to their advantage as they navigate the treacherous realms beyond Hell."

							"The origins and histories of hellhounds are deeply intertwined with the infernal realms of Hell itself. These enigmatic creatures trace their lineage back to the fiendish beings known as barghests, entities that have long roamed the darkest corners of the Nine Hells. While barghests are known for their terrifying canine forms, it is through their descendants, the hellhounds, that their legacy truly thrives. ",
							"In the twisted hierarchy of the Nine Hells, barghests occupy a peculiar position. Though fiendish in nature, they are not demons or devils, but rather exist as a separate breed of evil. Scholars of the planes speculate that barghests might have originated from a primordial source of darkness, a plane steeped in malevolence and shadow. These theories posit that barghests, with their savage and predatory instincts, found their way into the Nine Hells, drawn to the powerful energies and wickedness that pervade its realms. ",
							"It is within the Nine Hells that barghests underwent a transformation, adapting to the unique environment and becoming the feared and formidable creatures that are now known as hellhounds. Through countless generations, the essence of Hell seeped into their bloodline, gradually shaping them into their present form. The demonic influences intermingled with their inherent fiendish nature, imbuing them with both physical and metaphysical attributes that set them apart from their ancestors. ",
							"Hellhounds exhibit an exceptional duality, possessing both humanoid and bestial aspects. In their humanoid form, they retain a semblance of their barghest heritage, bearing a sinister and otherworldly presence. Their physical features often include elongated limbs, sharpened claws, and glowing eyes that hint at the darkness lurking within. It is in this form that they are capable of interacting with mortals, though their presence alone can evoke feelings of unease and trepidation. ",
							"However, it is their hound-like form that truly defines them. In this state, hellhounds embody ferocity, embodying the essence of a predator at the height of its power. Their transformation is seamless, as if their bodies shift effortlessly to assume the visage of a monstrous canine. Their fur becomes a dark, shadowy pelt, and their eyes ignite with an infernal fire that pierces through the gloom of the Nine Hells. ",
							"Throughout history, hellhounds have served various roles within the intricate tapestry of Hell's hierarchy. They are often employed as guardians and enforcers, utilizing their formidable physical prowess and supernatural abilities to carry out the will of their infernal masters. Some are bound to specific domains within the Nine Hells, patrolling the perimeters of infernal fortresses or lurking in the depths of labyrinthine catacombs. Others are dispatched as relentless pursuers, tracking down souls that have dared to escape their assigned fates, ensuring that no soul can elude its eternal torment.",
							"Despite their allegiance to the forces of Hell, hellhounds are not mindless automata. They possess a modicum of intelligence and individuality, allowing them to act with cunning and strategy when necessary. While they predominantly serve their infernal masters, some hellhounds have been known to strike their own bargains, aligning themselves with mortal beings who offer them something of value. These infernal pacts are precarious at best, as the loyalties of hellhounds can be as fickle as the shifting flames of Hell itself."

							"Hellhounds possess a formidable and distinctive physicality that sets them apart from other creatures in the multiverse. Combining their fiendish lineage with the influence of the infernal realms, these beings exhibit a striking and fearsome appearance, reflecting their ties to the Nine Hells. ",
							"In their humanoid form, hellhounds retain a humanoid shape but bear telltale signs of their fiendish nature. They typically stand tall, ranging in height from 6 to 7 feet, with a lean and sinewy build. Their limbs are elongated, granting them a predatory grace and an eerie sense of fluidity in movement. The flesh of a hellhound is often pale or grayish, lacking the warmth and vitality   of mortals. Their skin may be marked with intricate patterns or sinister tattoos, depicting symbols associated with their infernal origins. The facial features of a hellhound in their humanoid form are often striking and unsettling. Their eyes radiate an otherworldly glow, usually fiery hues such as crimson, amber, or sulfuric yellow. These eyes are a prominent feature, evoking a sense of burning intensity and malevolence. The mouth of a hellhound is filled with rows of sharp, pointed teeth, capable of tearing through flesh and bone with ease. Their jaws possess an unnatural flexibility, allowing them to open wide, revealing the depths of their predatory maw. ",
							"When a hellhound shifts into its hound-like form, its transformation is a sight to behold. The creature's body undergoes a metamorphosis, reshaping itself into a fearsome, shadowy predator. The size of a hellhound in its hound form can vary, with most ranging between the size of a large mastiff and that of a dire wolf. Their fur, once ordinary, transforms into a dark, almost ethereal pelt, reminiscent of the inky depths of the Nine Hells itself. The coloration of a hellhound's hound form often reflects the infernal energies that course through their veins.",
							"Their fur might possess shades of deep black, as if absorbing all light around them, or it may manifest as a smoldering mix of reds, purples, and oranges, reminiscent of flickering flames. This fiery appearance is further accentuated by the eyes of a hellhound in its hound form, which blaze with an intense, malevolent infernal fire. ",
							"Hellhounds possess physical attributes that grant them superior senses and agility. Their keen senses of smell and hearing allow them to track their prey with unerring accuracy, even in the darkest and most treacherous environments. Their agile frames enable them to move swiftly and gracefully, leaping and bounding with an almost supernatural grace. This speed and agility, combined with their raw strength and endurance, make them formidable opponents in both hunting and combat. ",
							"It is important to note that while hellhounds possess an inherently fiendish nature, their physical characteristics may display variations among individuals. Some hellhounds may bear unique traits or mutations, such as additional sets of fangs, bony protrusions, or even vestigial wings, further emphasizing the chaotic nature of their existence."

							"Within the depths of the Nine Hells, hellhounds have developed their own unique cultural customs and societal structures that shape their existence in the infernal realms. While their allegiance primarily lies with the dark forces of Hell, their society is not homogeneous, and variations can be found depending on the particular hellhound pack or domain they inhabit. ",
							"Hellhound society revolves around a strict hierarchical structure, with dominant individuals assuming positions of leadership and authority. These positions are not hereditary but are instead earned through displays of strength, cunning, and loyalty. In some packs, these positions may be fiercely contested, leading to power struggles and constant challenges to authority. The ruling elite of a hellhound pack often maintains control through a combination of fear, respect, and raw power. ",
							"At the core of hellhound culture is the concept of loyalty. Loyalty to their infernal masters, to their pack, and to their own kind is deeply ingrained within the psyche of hellhounds. This loyalty forms the foundation of their societal structure, creating a cohesive unit that can work together seamlessly to carry out their assigned duties and enforce the will of Hell. Betrayal or disloyalty is viewed with utmost disdain, often resulting in severe consequences or even excommunication from the pack. ",
							"Rituals and ceremonies play a significant role in hellhound culture. These events serve as both displays of power and opportunities for bonding within the pack. Ceremonies can range from savage combat trials, where aspiring individuals prove their mettle and strive to ascend the ranks, to intricate initiation rituals that mark the passage of a young hellhound into adulthood. These rituals often involve the invocation of infernal powers, further deepening the connection between the hellhounds and the dark forces that permeate the Nine Hells. ",
							"Language is an integral part of hellhound society. They possess their own unique dialect, a guttural and growling form of communication that is laden with symbolism and hidden meanings. This language is rarely spoken in the presence of non-hellhounds, serving as a secret code that reinforces their bonds and shields their plans and intentions from prying ears. Hellhounds take great pride in their linguistic prowess and view it as a mark of their identity and cultural heritage. ",
							"While hellhounds primarily interact with other fiendish beings within the Nine Hells, there are instances where they may form alliances or engage with mortals. These interactions are often transactional in nature, driven by self-interest or mutual benefit. Mortals who manage to earn the trust of a hellhound can gain a powerful and loyal ally, albeit one whose loyalties are tenuously tied to their own objectives and desires. ",
							"The concept of territory and dominion also holds significance in hellhound society. Packs establish their domains within the Nine Hells, fiercely guarding their territories against rival packs and interlopers. These territories may encompass a range of landscapes, from desolate wastelands to labyrinthine caverns, each carefully chosen to provide strategic advantages and resources that sustain the pack. Hellhounds use scent marking and territorial displays to assert dominance and ward off potential threats, ensuring the sanctity of their domain. ",
							"Artistic expressions among hellhounds are often dark and macabre, reflecting the harsh realities of the infernal realms. Their works of art might include intricate carvings depicting scenes of torment and suffering, or haunting melodies composed using bone and sinew as musical instruments. These artistic endeavors are embraced as forms of catharsis and as a means to explore and channel the innate darkness within their souls."

These enigmatic creatures have forsaken the path of their lighthearted and playful kin, forging a pact with devils that infuses them with diabolic power and grants them a connection to the infernal depths.",
							"The origins of the Infernal Gnomes can be traced back to a time when a group of gnomish explorers, driven by insatiable curiosity, stumbled upon a hidden portal leading to one of the lower planes of Hell. As they delved deeper into the dark abyss, their fates became entwined with the infernal forces that permeated the realm. Through a series of fateful encounters and desperate negotiations, these gnomes made pacts with powerful devils, binding their souls and ensuring their survival in the unforgiving landscape of Hell.",
							"Once their pact was sealed, a transformation took hold of the gnomes, forever altering their physical and metaphysical essence. Their once vibrant and colorful appearance now bears the unmistakable signs of their infernal allegiance. Skin tones shift to fiery reds, burnt oranges, and smoky grays, while their eyes gleam with an otherworldly luminescence. Fiendish tattoos emerge upon their flesh, marking them as the chosen ones of the infernal realm.",
							"The histories of the Infernal Gnomes are as diverse as the circles of Hell themselves. Some gnomes forged alliances with devils seeking knowledge and power, delving into the darkest secrets of Hell's libraries and archives. Others made their mark through their infernal craftsmanship, creating intricate and diabolical inventions that could manipulate the very fabric of the infernal planes. These gnomes earned a fearsome reputation for their ability to conjure infernal flames, harnessing fire as both a tool and a weapon.",
							"While the Infernal Gnomes are not as numerous as their surface-dwelling kin, their influence within the depths of Hell is profound. They have established enclaves and hidden communities within the various layers of Hell, crafting subterranean cities where their diabolical arts can flourish. Here, amidst the smoke and brimstone, they perpetuate their pact-bound existence, thriving on the raw energy and malevolent power that permeates the infernal realms.",
							"Despite their allegiance to the forces of darkness, Infernal Gnomes are not inherently evil. Their motivations and alignments vary greatly, with some gnomes utilizing their infernal gifts for personal gain or survival, while others strive to maintain a delicate balance between the infernal powers and the greater good. This dichotomy of purpose often creates internal conflicts within the Infernal Gnomes, forcing them to confront their own desires and the consequences of their choices.",

They possess a deep understanding of the intricacies of Hell, its hierarchies, and the shifting allegiances of its denizens. This knowledge, combined with their innate knack for invention and tinkering, makes them valuable assets in the treacherous realms of Hell, where survival often depends on one's wits and adaptability.",

They engage in elaborate intellectual pursuits, engaging in debates, riddles, and puzzles to hone their minds. Gnomish intellectuals are highly esteemed within their society, their knowledge and wisdom sought after by both their own kin and other denizens of Hell who recognize their expertise.",

Gifted with innate talent and fueled by their infernal powers, these gnomes excel in the creation of diabolical inventions and infernal contraptions. They use their skills to fashion tools, weapons, and artifacts that manipulate the forces of Hell itself. Each creation is a testament to their ingenuity and serves as a reminder of their mastery over the infernal arts.",

These cities are labyrinthine in design, with winding tunnels, secret chambers, and intricate mechanisms to deter intruders. Within these enclaves, a hierarchical structure based on infernal pacts and accomplishments emerges, with influential gnomes holding positions of authority.",

Their pacts with devils are at the core of their existence, and the intricacies of these agreements shape the relationships and interactions between individuals and factions. The Gnomish Pact Council, comprised of powerful gnomes who have achieved significant pacts, arbitrates disputes, negotiates new agreements, and ensures the overall stability of their society.",
							"Infernal Gnomes possess a strong sense of community and interdependence. They understand that survival in the harsh landscape of Hell requires cooperation and unity. Gnomes frequently form tightly knit groups, known as \"Covens,\" where members share resources, knowledge, and protection. These Covens act as both social units and adventuring parties, bound by a common goal or shared infernal pact.",

While some gnomes succumb to the temptations of power and engage in malevolent acts, others strive to maintain a balance between their infernal powers and the greater good. These individuals often form alliances with other races, working together to thwart the plans of greater evil or to seek redemption for their past transgressions.",

Visitors to their hidden enclaves are met with suspicion, and gaining the trust of an Infernal Gnome is a difficult task. However, those who manage to earn the respect and friendship of these gnomes find themselves welcomed into a world of unparalleled knowledge, infernal craftsmanship, and an unwavering loyalty that transcends the boundaries of the infernal realm."

The karkinos themselves have conflicting legends, owing to their nomadic lifestyle resulting in many cultural groups emerging, each attesting to their own lore.",
							"Regardless of their origins, most karkinos, especially those who hold to traditional beliefs, live a life of idyllic pastoralism. Herding flocks of giant crustaceans, schools of fish, and other placid oceanic life, karkinos families spend their days gazing into the endless depths and ruminating on the nature of the sea. Some karkinos are poets, whose musings are spread far and wide through underwater society, sung and rewritten as ballads and plays. Others isolate themselves far away from civilization with nothing more than their family or flocks for company. Living lives of quiet contemplation, they meditate on ancient truths only known to the long-lived and mysterious karkinos.",

							"Nephilim, the celestial-blooded beings, trace their origins to the extraordinary union between a celestial being and a mortal. The very nature of their birth intertwines the mortal and divine realms, resulting in a unique amalgamation of powers and characteristics. The stories of their creation vary, often steeped in legends and mythologies, but the common thread that binds them all is the extraordinary nature of their lineage.",
							"According to ancient lore, the celestial beings, whether angels, archons, or even gods themselves, are occasionally drawn to the mortal realm by their own inscrutable motives. In rare instances, they find themselves captivated by the mortal inhabitants, enticed by their passions, dreams, and unique essence. These celestial beings, embodying unearthly grace and radiance, might form deep emotional connections with mortals, leading to profound love and desire that transcends the boundaries of their respective realms.",
							"The offspring of such unions are the Nephilim, an extraordinary race that embodies the duality of their celestial and mortal heritage.",
							"With physical attributes that reflect their celestial lineage, Nephilim possess an otherworldly beauty that captivates all who gaze upon them. Their features often bear an ethereal quality, with luminous eyes, radiant skin, and hair that shimmers like celestial fire. Their presence alone can command attention, as if a fragment of the heavens has descended upon the mortal plane.",
							"But the Nephilim's connection to their celestial ancestry goes beyond mere physical beauty. They also inherit a portion of their celestial parent's immense power, granting them the ability to tap into celestial magic. Through their innate connection to the divine, Nephilim become potent spellcasters, capable of wielding spells that draw upon the radiant energies of the celestial realms. Their spells often manifest as brilliant beams of light, shimmering barriers of protection, or blessings that heal and rejuvenate their allies.",
							"Despite their extraordinary origins, the Nephilim face challenges unique to their existence. Their celestial bloodline can become a source of fascination, envy, or fear among both mortals and denizens of other planes. Mortals may revere them as blessed, viewing them as living conduits to the divine, while others may harbor suspicions or prejudices, perceiving the Nephilim as strangers or even threats. In the celestial realms, their mixed heritage might raise eyebrows, as they are neither wholly celestial nor entirely mortal, leading to questions about their true place in the cosmic order.",
							"The histories of the Nephilim are as diverse as the realms they inhabit. Some Nephilim grow up in mortal societies, embraced by their mortal parent's culture and traditions. These individuals often grapple with their celestial nature, trying to find a balance between their mortal upbringing and their inherent connection to the divine. Others are raised in the celestial realms, surrounded by celestial kin and schooled in the ways of celestial beings. These Nephilim often embark on journeys to the mortal plane, seeking to explore their mortal heritage and understand the mortal experience.",
							"Nephilim are no strangers to adversity, for their unique nature attracts the attention of various factions across the planes. Some view them as potential allies in the fight against evil, recognizing their celestial heritage as a powerful weapon against darkness. Others seek to exploit their powers or unravel the mysteries of their existence. As a result, Nephilim often find themselves navigating a complex web of alliances, rivalries, and quests, driven by the desire to find their place in the world and fulfill their celestial and mortal destinies."

							"Nephilim, born from the union of celestial beings and mortals, possess physical attributes that bear the unmistakable mark of their celestial heritage. While individual appearances may vary, there are certain characteristics that are commonly associated with the Nephilim race. These features set them apart from other beings and serve as a testament to their divine lineage.",
							"First and foremost, Nephilim are renowned for their captivating beauty. Their physical forms embody a unique blend of celestial grace and mortal allure, creating an aura of enchantment that draws the attention of all who behold them. Their features are often described as ethereal and radiant, captivating mortals and immortals alike. Nephilim possess luminous eyes that shimmer with an otherworldly glow, reflecting the celestial realms from which they originate. Their skin possesses a subtle radiance, as if touched by the gentle light of the stars, while their hair often cascades in waves of celestial hues, reminiscent of the celestial bodies themselves.",
							"The Nephilim's celestial heritage also influences their physique. They tend to possess a stature that is both elegant and commanding, exuding an air of regality that demands respect. Their bodies are usually lean and well-proportioned, reflecting a balance between strength and grace. Nephilim possess a natural poise and fluidity in their movements, as if their steps are guided by the celestial harmonies of the heavens.",
							"In addition to their physical beauty, Nephilim often bear markings or symbols that serve as visible manifestations of their celestial lineage. These markings can vary greatly, ranging from delicate and intricate patterns that adorn their skin to celestial sigils that glow faintly when they tap into their celestial powers. These markings are not mere tattoos or birthmarks; rather, they are celestial imprints that NEW CHARACTER OPTIONS 56 highlight the Nephilim's connection to the celestial realms, serving as a visual reminder of their unique heritage.",
							"It is important to note that while Nephilim possess extraordinary physical traits, they are not invulnerable or immune to the passage of time. Like all mortals, they age and eventually face the inevitability of death. However, their aging process tends to be slowed compared to that of pure mortals, allowing them to retain their beauty and vitality for longer periods. This extended lifespan gives Nephilim the opportunity to leave a lasting impact on the world, making the most of their celestial gifts and fulfilling their destinies.",
							"It is crucial to recognize that Nephilim's physical characteristics go beyond mere aesthetics. They are a reflection of their dual nature, embodying the harmonious blending of celestial and mortal essences.

While customs and societal norms can vary among different communities of Nephilim, there are certain overarching themes and values that define their collective identity.",
							"One of the fundamental aspects of Nephilim society is the reverence and appreciation for beauty in all its forms. Nephilim hold aesthetics in high regard, seeing it as a reflection of their celestial lineage. Art, music, and poetry are celebrated as expressions of their connection to the divine. Nephilim artisans create masterpieces that capture the essence of the celestial realms, while their musicians compose melodies that resonate with the harmonies of the heavens. Beauty is seen as a powerful force that can inspire, heal, and uplift the spirits of both Nephilim and those around them.",
							"Furthermore, Nephilim society places great importance on the pursuit of knowledge and wisdom. Their celestial heritage instills within them a thirst for understanding the mysteries of the universe and the realms beyond. Nephilim scholars delve into the ancient texts, seeking insights into the cosmic order and the intricacies of celestial magic. They also serve as keepers of history, chronicling the tales of their people and preserving the knowledge passed down through generations. The pursuit of knowledge is not solely for personal gain but is seen as a sacred duty to contribute to the collective wisdom of Nephilim society.",
							"Harmony and balance are cherished values in Nephilim culture. They seek to find equilibrium between their mortal and celestial aspects, understanding that both sides of their heritage contribute to their wholeness. This pursuit of balance extends to their relationships with others, as Nephilim strive to foster harmonious connections and promote unity among diverse beings. They are known for their diplomacy and empathy, often serving as mediators in conflicts, seeking resolutions that uphold justice and restore equilibrium.",
							"Religion and spirituality hold a significant place in Nephilim society. Their celestial bloodline makes them keenly aware of the divine forces at play in the universe. While Nephilim may not adhere to a single organized religion, they share a deep reverence for the celestial beings and the pantheon of gods associated with their celestial heritage. They offer prayers, perform rituals, and engage in acts of devotion to honor and seek guidance from the celestial powers. Nephilim temples and sacred sites are places of quiet reflection and spiritual communion, where individuals can connect with the celestial realms and draw strength from their celestial ancestors.",
							"The Nephilim society is not homogeneous but rather embraces diversity in all its forms. They recognize that their celestial and mortal bloodlines can intertwine with a multitude of cultural backgrounds, resulting in a tapestry of traditions and customs. This acceptance of diversity is celebrated, as Nephilim communities often engage in cultural exchange, learning from one another's practices and forging bonds that transcend boundaries. This openness extends to relationships as well, as Nephilim hold no prejudice based on race, gender, or creed, valuing individuals for their character and actions."

							"The origins of Sanguine Vampires are shrouded in mystery, as the true nature of their creation lies in the depths of infernal realms. Legend tells of mortal beings who, driven by an insatiable thirst for power and forbidden knowledge, sought dark pacts with powerful infernal entities. These entities, drawn to the fervent desires and twisted ambitions of these mortals, offered them a macabre gift - the infusion of demon blood, forever transforming them into Sanguine Vampires. ",
							"The exact circumstances of these pacts vary, with some accounts speaking of clandestine meetings in hidden crypts, where desperate individuals would invoke unholy rituals to attract the attention of infernal patrons. Others speak of forbidden tomes and ancient artifacts that, when used in specific rituals, would open the doorway to the infernal realms, allowing mortals to beseech powerful entities for their dark blessings. ",
							"Whatever the means, the consequence of these pacts was the infusion of demonic essence into the mortal bloodstream. This infernal blood, intermingled with their own, granted them extraordinary abilities and forever altered their existence. However, this transformation came at a great cost - the relinquishment of their humanity and the embrace of their newfound vampiric nature. ",
							"In the annals of history, Sanguine Vampires have been both feared and revered. Some tales portray them as agents of chaos and malevolence, beings to be hunted and vanquished for their unholy nature. Other accounts, however, depict them as tragic figures, cursed by their insatiable thirst for blood and forever locked in a perpetual struggle between their lingering humanity and their infernal essence. ",
							"Throughout the ages, Sanguine Vampires have wielded their dark powers, leaving indelible marks upon the world. From ancient legends of immortal tyrants who ruled over kingdoms in shadow, to whispered tales of elusive assassins who struck fear into the hearts of even the bravest warriors, the histories of Sanguine Vampires are woven with threads of darkness and allure. ",
							"Their blood magic, an intrinsic part of their existence, is a source of both fascination and trepidation. Sanguine Vampires can manipulate the very life essence within their victims, draining it to sustain their own unholy vitality. This mastery over blood magic grants them the ability to unleash devastating attacks, manipulate the flow of blood, and even command the loyalty of lesser creatures tainted by infernal power. ",
							"Yet, despite their formidable powers, Sanguine Vampires are not immune to the shadows that plague their souls. They carry the burden of their infernal nature, grappling with their insatiable hunger for blood and the constant temptation to succumb to their demonic impulses. Some Sanguine Vampires seek redemption and strive to resist their darker urges, while others revel in their damnation, embracing the darkness that courses through their veins."

While still retaining some vestiges of their former human selves, their physical characteristics have been irrevocably altered by their unholy transformation. ",
							"The most distinctive feature of Sanguine Vampires is their pallid complexion, which ranges from a deathly pale white to a sickly gray hue. Their skin appears almost translucent, as if a thin veil separates them from the realm of the living. The touch of the infernal has left its mark, lending an ethereal quality to their appearance. ",
							"Their eyes, windows to their darkened souls, are mesmerizing and unsettling. Sanguine Vampires' eyes typically bear a deep crimson color, reminiscent of freshly spilled blood. The intensity of their gaze is often disconcerting, as if it carries the weight of untold centuries and the secrets of the infernal realms.  ",
							"Fangs, elongated and razor-sharp, jut forth from their mouths, a clear sign of their vampiric nature. These fangs are not only used for feeding upon the life essence of their victims but also serve as symbols of their infernal pact. The very sight of these fangs strikes fear into the hearts of those who encounter them, for they represent the dark power that flows within the Sanguine Vampires. ",
							"Their hair, once vibrant and full of life, now bears the color of the deepest shadows. It cascades in long, flowing locks, often accentuating their mysterious and alluring presence. While some Sanguine Vampires maintain the appearance they possessed before their transformation, others find that their hair takes on shades of crimson, as if echoing the blood that courses through their veins.",
							"In terms of physique, Sanguine Vampires possess an unnerving grace and a lean, athletic build. Their movements are fluid and precise, allowing them to stalk their prey with silent elegance. Their bodies are honed for combat, with heightened reflexes and agility that surpass the capabilities of mere mortals. It is as if the infernal essence within them has granted them a supernatural prowess, enhancing their physical capabilities to extraordinary levels.",
							"While Sanguine Vampires bear a resemblance to their former selves, their visage is often marked by the passage of time. Some display subtle signs of aging, such as fine lines and wrinkles that accentuate the gravity of their eternal existence. Others remain eternally frozen in the prime of their physical form, untouched by the ravages of time."

Fueled by their infernal nature and bound by their shared vampiric essence, these immortal beings have developed a set of cultural customs and societal structures that reflect both their enduring legacy and the ever-present darkness that permeates their existence. ",
							"The first and most fundamental aspect of Sanguine Vampire society is the recognition of the power dynamics among their kind. Within their hierarchy, elder Sanguine Vampires hold positions of authority, commanding respect and reverence from those who are younger or less experienced. This hierarchical structure is often based on age, with the oldest and most powerful individuals assuming leadership roles and guiding the direction of their communities. ",
							"Sanguine Vampire communities, often referred to as covens or bloodlines, are close-knit and exclusive. Trust is paramount, as betrayal or exposure to outside forces could jeopardize the safety and secrecy of their existence. Consequently, newcomers seeking to join these covens undergo rigorous scrutiny and initiation rituals to prove their loyalty and commitment to the group. Once accepted, they become part of a tightly knit family, bound together by their shared infernal heritage and the insatiable thirst for blood. ",
							"Blood, the life-giving essence that sustains their unholy vitality, holds immense significance in Sanguine Vampire society. It serves as both a physical necessity and a symbolic representation of their power and connection to the infernal realms. Ritualistic blood ceremonies, where members of the coven partake in the communal consumption of blood, are common occurrences. These ceremonies not only satiate their hunger but also strengthen the bonds between members, reinforcing their shared identity and collective purpose. ",
							"In their society, knowledge is highly valued, particularly when it comes to the mastery of blood magic. Sanguine Vampires dedicate significant time and effort to the study and refinement of their magical abilities, passing down their arcane knowledge through generations. Ancient tomes and forbidden grimoires, often protected within their covens' sanctuaries, contain the accumulated wisdom of centuries, providing a foundation for their magical practices and unlocking new depths of power. ",
							"While Sanguine Vampires predominantly interact within their own communities, they occasionally establish alliances or engage in diplomatic relations with other supernatural entities. These alliances are typically driven by mutual benefit, such as securing territories, pooling resources, or facing common adversaries. However, these interactions are always cautious and veiled with a degree of suspicion, as the inherent darkness and potential for treachery in the infernal realms make trust a scarce commodity. ",
							"Despite their vampiric nature, Sanguine Vampires are not devoid of emotions and social bonds. They may form intricate relationships with mortals or even members of their own kind. These connections often teeter on a delicate balance between passion and danger, as the Sanguine Vampire's thirst for blood and their dark nature can pose a constant threat to those they hold dear. Nevertheless, some Sanguine Vampires find solace and companionship within these relationships, cherishing the fleeting moments of connection in their eternal existence."
