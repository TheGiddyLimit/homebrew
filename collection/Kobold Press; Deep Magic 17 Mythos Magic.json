						"Welcome to the most hideous collection of rituals and conjurations your grimoir has ever seen! After harrowing journeys through shadow realms and the Void, {@i Deep Magic} explores the essence of fear itself with a look at mythos magic. These dread pages will lay bare the accursed secrets of mad prophets and unearth the furtive legends of ancient and forgotten cities.",
						"The work of the author H. P. Lovecraft\u2014the so-called \"Cthulhu mythos\"\u2014has been a cornerstone of RPG storytelling since E. Gary Gygax immortalized its influence in his \"Inspirational and Educational Reading\" list. Taking its name from Lovecraft's famous story \"The Call of Cthulhu,\" the mythos has become the backdrop for a wide subgenre of fiction called cosmic horror. At the foundation of cosmic horror are two ideas: that the human mind is too tiny and weak to comprehend more than the barest glimmer of the vastness of the universe and the alien mysteries it contains, and that among those mysteries are entities so ancient, powerful, and malevolent that they could extinguish Earth's insignificant civilization without caring or even noticing. These ideas are perfectly encapsulated in two quotes from Lovecraft himself. The first, from his essay \"Supernatural Horror in Literature,\" disclaims that \"the oldest and strongest emotion of mankind is fear, and the oldest and strongest kind of fear is fear of the unknown.\" The second quote is from \"The Call of Cthulhu,\" wherein the narrator opens his tale with the warning that \"the most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents.\"",
						"With that in mind, we've explored those \"hidden and fathomless worlds of strange life which may pulsate in the gulfs beyond the stars\" that Lovecraft and his contemporaries pioneered in their strange fiction. Herein you will find a host of forbidden secrets and eldritch lore; a clandestine sort of magic that is full of both cosmic potential and horrific consequences, and knowledge of which erodes the sanity of all who pursue it.",

								"Although Lovecraft didn't single-handedly invent the genre of cosmic horror, he refined it and perfected it to a degree that fundamentally changed the horror storytelling. His work in the early years of the 20th century still influences writers and filmmakers today.",
								"But Lovecraft also lived a cloistered life of self-imposed seclusion, bedeviled with mental and physical illness and with toxic notions about non-European culture and race. Many of his story themes arose from his racism and xenophobia: sometimes it's subtle, sometimes it's not subtle in the least. And if you miss it in his fiction, it's impossible to overlook in his essays and voluminous letters to friends. It's difficult to celebrate the man, given the loathsome viewpoints he brazenly endorsed.",
								"In light of that, how can we still enjoy his stories and revere his mythical creations? Perhaps these imaginative tales of cosmic terror serve as the perverse confessions of a small-minded man who struggled to understand a world where he was surrounded by people who frightened and disgusted him; a pitiful creature who voiced his doubts and inadequacies through existential horror. When we study Lovecraft and his writing, we delve not only into a realm of insane cultists and incomprehensible monstrosities but also into a reprehensible aspect of human nature Lovecraft knew all too well. When we tell our own stories in his mythos, it's our responsibility to identify and admonish these detestable perspectives, lest we become monsters ourselves."

Only warlocks whose patron is a Great Old One, however, have, have unrestricted access. All other characters can learn mythos spells only if they learn the spell from one of the forbidden and furtive tomes of the Cthulhu mythos or see the spell being cast.",

								"If antiquity looks upon the stories of Tolkien and dreams of fated rings, or reflects upon the multiverse of Moorcock's White Wolf and thinks of cursed swords, then surely the Cthulhu mythos will be remembered for its magical tomes.

How they made their way through time and space to wind up on alien worlds like Midgard or your own setting is the stuff of splendidly macabre speculation (and ultimately is up to you, the Game Master). One thing's for sure: these tomes are beyond precious to all who hunger for the eldritch knowledge of the Great Old Ones, and such longings aren't restricted to humanity and near-humanity.
