Forest dragons are composed of a combination of vines, branches, needles, forming a hard shell that creates the general shape of a true dragon. However, forest dragons are entirely plant based - they have no internal organs, they do not need to eat, and they perform photosynthesis. Forest dragons are borns from giant seed pods, and pass through all the same stages of growth as a true dragon. Forest dragons hate any creature that defiles its forest lair, especially true dragons. If a forest dragon encounters a chromatic dragon, a fight to the death will almost always occur, with the forest dragon dutifully defending its forest from the evil intruder."
