The wearer of the Crown chooses which ability they want to raise, but raising Wisdom while wearing the Crown isn't the best use, as you're already basically immune to charm person and other mind-dominating spells. That is, unless you use Wisdom for spellcasting, in which case 24 Wisdom is going to rock your enemies for however long it lasts.",

But 24 is so high (+7!) that you can even raise your best ability and be even better at whatever you do. So it's a choice between surviving longer and doing your thing better.",
										"Once someone is Crowned, the Princip enjoys wading into battle and smashing things with its scepter. Like all the Court, the Princip prefers to smash evil over neutral monsters, but it tends to try to defend the character it Crowned, even over the character who summoned it. However, if it thinks the Crowned character is now so powerful it doesn't need help, it defaults to the character who summoned it (if they're different people). If neither its summoner or the Crowned needs help, the Princip defends the most vulnerable party member.",

It can cast haste three times, which is enough to make a huge difference on its own. Or stoneskin for anyone who's getting hammered in combat, and remove curse in case the party was in trouble when it arrived.",

								"In 1985 I was fifteen and a sophomore at Cypress High School, and I spent the year in my computer science class with Brad Thomas and Chris Steele talking about Elric and the Black Company and the Incarnations of Immortality. They were friends outside of school, part of a larger group, but I was still hanging out with the kids I grew up with in my apartment complex. I knew Chris and Brad played board games and roleplaying games, and I wanted in.",
								"At the end of the school year I signed their yearbooks: \"If you guys get together to play games, give me a call.\" They did. About thirty seconds later, they were my best friends. It changed my life.",
								"We spent that summer playing board games and RPGs and going to the mall, and the arcade, and hanging out at the pool. It's a time and place that has now been immortalized and paid homage to in popular fiction. When I want to connect with my mother's formative years, I watch {@i American Graffiti}, filmed one town over from where she grew up. Folks looking for that same experience for my generation's formative years watch {@i Stranger Things}. It was easy for an adult back then watching us sitting around Dave Miles' pool table rolling strange dice, listening to Rush, and pretending to be elves to imagine we were wasting our time. And not just adults, a lot of our peers felt the same way. But I never did. I knew something worthwhile and remarkable would come out of the hobby: a lifetime of creativity and memories and shared experiences doing something amazing with my friends whom I loved. You don't need YouTube or Kickstarter, it's reward enough just ending up at the end of your life being able to look back on the worlds you created and shared with your friends and the heroic adventures you undertook. The hobby isn't a means to an end, it is an end unto itself. And while the places and events and people and things we create and meet in our secondary worlds are not real, one thing is.",
								"Dreams are not real. Nothing that happens in a dream is real. With one exception. Chris Nolan wrote a whole movie about it.",
								"{@i Inception} takes place in dreams but it's about movies. It argues that while all these people and places and events are not real, something in film is. The emotions you feel watching a movie are real. That's what gives them meaning and value. When I watch Casablanca I fall in love with Ilsa every time. Generations of kids watched {@i The Adventures of Robin Hood} and ran outside play-swordfighting. Because the emotions you feel at the movies are real. Inception is using dreams to make a point about movies. And, I argue, RPGs.",

						"Once upon a time in the dim days of the hobby known as the 1970s, the game assumed you played until you were about 7th level and then built a stronghold. There were no rules for this, nor was any reason given for why the player or their character might want to do such a thing.",
						"For those original players, building a stronghold was a {@i self-evident good}. It was just neat, and they assumed it would be obvious why you would want to do such a thing. It meant your character was now interested in things besides killing orcs and acquiring gold. Treasure was a means to an end. As your character grew in power, they became more concerned with the state of the world. There were political conflicts and armies and incursions from other dimensions, and a single fighter with a sword, even a very nice sword with its own personality and special purpose, was not enough. You needed an army, or new spells, or extraplanar allies.",

						"Every stronghold also improves your signature class feature, powering up your Bardic Inspiration or your monk's Ki. Strongholds grant {@b improved class features} because they draw power from the land itself.",
						"The local area around your stronghold is called your {@b demesne} (deh-MAIN). Within your demesne, your character is now, if not ruler, certainly a very important person, so the power of the land manifests itself in unusual ways in your favor.",

You're to be forgiven for not knowing the difference.\" It glanced at them again briefly. \"Do you know where I put the Treatise on Manifold Planes? I was certain I filed it away with the rest of the geometries. Will take me forever to organize this place. And I don't have forever.\" This last was muttered under its...",
										"\"I...can you all hear that?\" Jeremy asked, pressing his hands to his head.",
										"\"It's in my mind,\" Credan said. \"I can hear it between my ears.\" It wasn't an unpleasant sensation. There was a bit of an echo. The voice seemed to be coming from a cave. Were it not for the incredibly expressive face of the creature, eyebrows raising, eyes darting around, lips frowning or sneering, they wouldn't have connected the voice to the creature.",
										"The creature floated around. \"What?\" it asked. \"Oh. Well, we topaz develop mindspeech early. It shouldn't cause you any...discomfort.\" It spoke absentmindedly, tiny hand-like paws fingering the spines of books. A fin atop its head waved slowly in time with tendrils growing from its jaw, as though moved by underwater currents.",
										"\"It's a...I think it's a dragon,\" Meliora said.",
										"The creature turned and gave them a knowing look. If it had possessed spectacles, it would have peered over them. \"Yes, well done. And you are terrans. Oh that's rude, isn't it? Forgive me. Men.\"",
										"\"And women!\" Wenna exclaimed.",
										"\"Truly?\" The dragon turned back to the books. \"Well. I cherish my ignorance on the subject.\"",
										"\"If you're a dragon...\" Wenna said, suspiciously, \"where are your wings?!\" Credan tugged on her linen shirt in a vain attempt to hush her.",
										"\"Hands are better, don't you think?\"",
										"\"But how do you fly?\" Meliora demanded.",
										"The dragon turned again to them. It tapped its head with a single finger from its tiny forepaws, then returned to its work.",
										"\"We have to go back,\" Credan said, now tugging on Dade and Jeremy's makeshift armor.",
										"\"Da needs to know about this.\"",
										"The topaz wyrmling turned at this, and stared at them, blinking. Then it made the connection. \"You're children!\"",
										"\"I'll have eighteen summers this Lyleth,\" Dade said, standing up straight.",
										"\"Indeed? Fascinating, fascinating. Older than me, when taken in percentages.\"",
										"\"Older than you?\" Meliora stepped forward. She couldn't control her curiosity. Her hands twitched with desire to touch the thing.",
										"\"Yes, well. What is time? I've spent most of the last several thousand years asleep. Lot of that going around, I'm told. Though, of course, not anymore.\"",
										"Very little of the conversation made sense to the children. Jeremy looked at Dade. Decided to assert himself.",
										"\"We killed the goblins,\" he said. \"Who infested the tower.\"",
										"\"Did you!? Well done, well done. Filthy little things, probably a mistake in retrospect. Ah, well that deserves an introduction, I dare say.\" The creature floated around, following the curve of the round room, lowering itself until its legs, in the daintiest way possible, reached out and touched the ground, supported its weight. Then it fluidly walked toward them, each of its six legs moving like on a well-coordinated marionette.",
										"\"My name is Irdizavonax.\" The little dragon bowed. When it straightened, it was only a little shorter than Dade. As tall as Jeremy. Taller than the others. \"I am the keeper of this tower. Currently. I believe the tradition established by the human wizards who build these things is that, having gained the inner sanctum, you may ask a question.\"",
										"They looked at each other. Meliora, as was typical, ventured a response.",
										"\"Well...w-what should we ask?\"",
										"The topaz wyrmling looked around the abandoned wizard's tower, its original owner long dead, then looked back at the children. \"No idea!\" it exclaimed. \"Not my tradition. Perhaps it would be better if I gave you answers first.\"",
										"The creature looked at the ground, suddenly somber. Seemed to gather its thoughts. Then it regarded them again with its alien eyes.",
										"\"Your world is in danger,\" the creature thought at them. \"Corovaxinar stirs, and many of my kith and kin awake. I don't need to tell you, this bodes ill.\"",
										"\"It does?\" Jeremy asked, astonished.",
										"\"Alright, I do need to tell you. Someone from another world, perhaps the World Below? Primordius? I can't be certain, I'm new at this. Someone is trying to merge their world with yours. With ours. It's an invasion, you might say. One reality attacking another. If successful, it would mean most of our world would be...rewritten. Replaced. This would be a catastrophe, you understand.\" It drew itself up proudly.",
										"\"The gemstone dragons intend to stop them. I think...I think it's why we were created, if you would allow me to wax philosophical for a moment.\"",
										"Jeremy looked from Wenna to Credan to Dade. Meliora was lost in admiration. He looked back at the dragon. \"We don't understand.\"",
										"\"I'm not surprised. Well, this place is yours now, if it's anyone's. I can teach you what you want to know. Or at least, what you need to know, which is more important. I thought some great human wizard would be here but...perhaps...children are better. Much to learn here and all of it written by your ancestors, not mine. Your Shauraseni Empire rivaled any loremasters of the celestials. Ah, elves, I think you call them.",
										"\"In any event, by right this tower is now yours, and I,\" it said, bowing again, \"am your servant. For the time being at least.\"",
										"\"Oh my,\" Wenna said, and the others looked from the dragon to her. She turned to them and beamed.",
										"\"We've been on a quest!\""

The eldest of them sleep to protect the world\u2014the ones remaining do, at any rate. Mostly I think the chromatics sleep because they know how angry their god would be if they dared to wake.\"",

Nothing personal, you understand.\" Irdy looked with some awe at the eldest sapphire. \"It's just the power of it.\"",

										"She tuned her lute and stepped forward. She always seemed frightened, frightened by everything, but music made her bold. Given the nature of her weapons, perhaps the boldest of them all. To face the ancient sapphire demigod, armed only with strings and a song.",
										"The song was a trifle. Nothing like the tunes the Riojan in Blackbottom taught her. It was a folk song from home, and it made the children glad and homesick.",
										"Before she could finish the song, a flash of sapphire energy\u2014and a being materialized in mid-stride, walking toward them.",
										"It was short, at least, shorter than Dade. Lithe. Humanoid in form, but otherwise an insect with brilliant, multifaceted eyes. It bore twin rapiers at its hips and wore emerald green armor that reflected light with a liquid sheen, unlike any substance they'd seen before. It reminded them of a beetle's carapace.",
										"Its antennae curled and twitched, sensing arcane forces in the air. It seemed full of cocky confidence and daring.",
										"\"A mantis knight!\" Irdy exclaimed in delight. \"Oh I'd forgotten about them. Well done, old lady.\"",
										"Wenna, Dade, and Jeremy had drawn their weapons. Credan started saying a prayer under his breath. Only Meliora did nothing, except wonder. She was already way ahead of them.",
										"\"This isn't real, is it?\" She could tell by the way it manifested.",
										"\"Very good,\" Irdizavonax said with a slight bow. \"Well, real is, as Orvosortiax taught you, mostly a collection of habits, and by that standard...this creature is very real.\"",
										"The creature stopped before them and bowed, one hand flourishing before it, the opposite leg extended slightly out.",
										"It spoke. Its voice was gay, like birdsong on a spring morning. \"Corovaxinar remembers things that were, things that should have been, and things that might yet be. I am Lady Eweshtleth. I hold the honor of the Gate and the Door.\"",
										"The children stared in rapt attention. Only Irdizavonax was not in awe. \"They're from the Court of...well, now the Court of Arcadia, I suppose,\" he said. \"But once the Mantis Knights were the chief lieutenants of the elves. Still are, I imagine. Somewhere.\"",
										"\"So this a...a memory?\" Meliora asked.",
										"\"Good guess, but I don't think so. Well, maybe. Rather I suspect this is a real person who lived...or will live, displaced chronographically.\"",
										"\"What?\" Several of the children asked.",
										"\"Oh she's from the past, probably. Or the future.\" When none of them spoke, Irdy took it upon himself to impress them with the gravity of the situation. \"This is the power of the Eldest.\"",
										"Meliora looked at the little dragon. Someday...if they succeeded, a million million years from now, Irdy would be like that massive creature slumbering before them. She wondered, privately, if the little dragon would remember them then.",
										"\"Corovaxinar welcomes you,\" the alien insect-woman spoke in a smooth, assured voice. Quite unlike the absentminded old professor they'd gotten used to in Irdy.",
										"Everyone looked to Irdy, but Irdy nodded to Meliora.",
										"\"Oh. Ah. Okay, um...hello. Ah, welcome to...our world.\"",
										"\"A world under siege,\" the Mantis Knight said to Meliora. \"Corovaxinar needs your help.\"",
										"\"We need hers,\" Meliora said.",
										"\"A happy mutuality of purpose,\" the knight said, and bowed its head, smiling.",
										"\"Oh I like her,\" Irdy said, turning to Dade with a smile.",
										"\"Prepare yourselves,\" the knight said, drawing herself up.",
										"\"Um...um for what?\" Credan asked.",
										"\"The War rages. Corovaxinar's projections falter. But you are not projections.\"",
										"\"But we're just...\" Credan gestured from Wenna to Jeremy. \"Kids.\"",
										"Lady Eweshtleth raised an eyebrow and one antenna twitched. \"Are you now? I think not. You summoned me. You found the hidden fastness of the Eldest when none of your ilk could gain its sanctum.",
										"\"I do not wot of Men. There are none yet, in my time. Or have not been any for millennia. But I deem thee worthy, if any are.\"",
										"\"'If any are,'\" Jeremy echoed, looking at his older brother. Dade shook his head in disbelief.",
										"\"Besides,\" Lady Eweshtleth said, nodding at the axe on Dade's hip, \"you bear The Edge That Severs Souls. A weapon that would master lesser beings.\"",
										"\"The Soul Carver!\" Irdizavonax exclaimed, taking a step back from Dade. \"Ah yes! Many threads converge. Much that was hidden is now revealed. Hah! And to think I stood with you when you found it. Ahh, to be alive and young in such a time.\"",
										"\"We didn't...\" Dade said, his hand on the pommel of the axe. \"We don't know what that means.\"",
										"\"Yes well don't let that stop you, by all means. You've managed to do pretty well for yourselves knowing not much more than a bunch of farmers' sons and daughters. No reason to change tactics now.\"",
										"\"What...\" Meliora said, taking a step toward the Mantis Knight. \"Where will we be going?\"",
										"The knight cleared her throat, and a portal opened behind her. A swirling, cloudy thing. \"I am the Gate and the Door,\" she said.",
										"\"The door to where?\" Meliora challenged.",
										"\"The World Below,\" Lady Eweshtleth said. The children gasped. They suspected, they feared, but knowing it was another thing altogether.",
										"\"I don't think...\" Credan put a hand on the talisman to St. Gryffyn the Stout. \"I don't think St. Gryffyn can hear me there.\"",
										"Lady Eweshtleth cocked her head as though listening to a voice, which she was, and nodded. \"Corovaxinar will maintain the portal and act as a conduit. Your saint will hear your prayers.\"",
										"\"What will we find there?\" Meliora asked.",
										"Lady Eweshtleth straightened and assumed a dour persona. \"Horrors,\" she said.",
										"\"How can we face them?\" Wenna asked.",
										"\"As with all things,\" Lady Eweshtleth laughed, her dour demeanor gone. She placed a hand on one elven rapier. \"With song, spell, and steel.\"",
										"She stepped aside and gestured to the portal. Dade and Jeremy looked at each other and then started forward. The others followed.",
										"At the edge of the portal, they stopped and looked behind them. Irdizavonax hadn't moved. Looking very small now, he stood alone.",
										"\"Aren't you coming with us?\" Credan asked.",
										"\"Coming with you? Into that?\" The small topaz dragon nodded at the gate. \"I beg your pardon! Hardly. No, you've already got Corovaxinar on your side\u2014I would be useless. A trifle. Besides, what use is a young sage compared with five stalwart heroes!\" He was teasing them. But he really wasn't going.",
										"Meliora walked back to him. She'd grown and was now a little taller than the topaz wyrmling. \"But we need you,\" she said, her eyes watering.",
										"\"Ah, you like me, and for that am I flattered, lady. But you do not need me. Think back to all you've done. What hand did I play? A humble narrator, little more. It was your actions, your bravery that led you here. All I did was...explain things frankly that I don't think you needed to know.\" \"We'll miss you,\" Meliora said, her voice quiet.",
										"\"Well, I'm not going anywhere,\" Irdizavonax said, looking around the cave. \"I'll be safe as houses here. And I'll be waiting, when you come back.\"",
										"\"Come on,\" Dade said, not unkindly.",
										"Meliora nodded and turned. But Irdizavonax stopped her.",
										"\"Meliora,\" he said, and she turned back.",
										"\"To answer your question,\" Irdy said, walking forward. His voice in her mind was quiet. She knew only she could hear him now. \"I will always remember you,\" Irdizavonax, the topaz wyrmling, said, his wide milky eyes looking up at her in wonder.",
										"Meliora started to cry.",
										"Irdizavonax took a step back and turned his mindspeech back up.",
										"\"Goodbye, tiny humans!\" He waved to them as Meliora joined her friends, wiping her eyes with the sleeve of her robe. \"And good luck.\"",
										"The children stepped through the portal. Lady Eweshtleth saluted Irdizavonax with her rapier, and followed.",
										"\"I'll miss you too,\" Irdizavonax thought, to no one in particular."

They showed up to play their character and had no interest in running an army.",
								"This system, therefore, is opt-in. You can award your players units, they can hire mercenary units, they can build a stronghold and attract units, and they may use them in battle. But a player who finds warfare distasteful can literally ignore it all, and while the other players are commanding an army, they'll just be playing their characters. While you can use this system all by itself to resolve a battle\u2014or use the rules in {@book Appendix: Simple Warfare|SaF|11} (page 241) for something even faster and more streamlined\u2014this system assumes a battle (clash of armies) takes place at the {@b same time} as an encounter (PCs fighting monsters and bad guys).

						"The Siege of Castle Rend is an adventure for the fifth edition of the world's first roleplaying game, suitable for five 5th-level characters. It takes place over four parts, and each part can be completed in one or two sessions of play, depending on your group's playstyle and how long you like to play in a single sitting. If all goes according to plan over the course of this adventure, the player characters will expose an usurping lord, fight orcs, acquire a stronghold, defend it from an invading army, win the admiration of a town filled with potential vassals, and make political connections within the Barony of Bedegar.",
						"Of course, no adventure goes according to plan. The PCs will invariably throw these well-laid schemes into chaos, and they'll have to improvise. But if we know how things would have gone if the PCs never showed up (or are cowards), it makes it easier for us GMs to improvise when things go off the rails.",

								"One of our stretch goals was an adventure using these rules...and this is it! Some of you may be familiar with it if you've watched my original campaign diaries. They basically begin right before the action in this adventure. There are several ways to get a stronghold: a local noble awards one, you buy one, or\u2014perhaps the most common: you clear out a ruin and say, \"Let's make this our base!\" So we use this adventure to show off arguably the most complex iteration of these rules: The players clear out a castle infested with orcs, become embroiled in the local political landscape, and must decide how they're going to use their new stronghold. (Is it a castle with a keep, tower, and temple inside? Or just a huge keep? Not an insignificant question when an enemy army is bearing down on you!)",
								"I wrote the outline for this adventure and had already run it two or three times in my own games, but to minimize the impact on our production schedule, I asked James Haeck to write it.

I can't wait to run her the next time I deploy this adventure. üòÉ",
