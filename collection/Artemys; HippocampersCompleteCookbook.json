						"A round-bellied halfling stirs the great iron pot, almost as large as he is, simmering over the embers of last night's campfire. He lifts a portion of tender venison from the stew to taste before adding a pinch of salt and pepper from his pouch. The empty ladle finds the flank of the iron pot, rousing the rest of the adventuring party to breakfast with a clanging alarm. The predawn grumblingsoon gives way to the licking of lips. They shall feast like kings on the hunt before diving into the necropolis hidden ahead.",
						"A human woman, cutting an intimidating figure in her armor of patchwork skins and scales, squats on the edge of a jagged outcrop. The chimera broken across the rocks offers a unique blend of meats she can use. She begins to skin and butcher the monster, already salivating at the thought of what thrills the meal will bring. The fiery glands in the throat she saves for last, handling them carefully. Surely there is some way to incorporate the mixture into a spicy goat curry...",
						"A drow sits in their make-up, resisting the urge to scratch at the pale stuff by sipping casually at their wine. The fools arranged around the table of a supposed high elf diplomat are already many cups deep into their own. The kitchen doors swing open and the drow summons forth the servants bearing the main course - personally prepared before the arrival of the guests. They tuck in eagerly, tearing the food from the silver platters with uncivilized haste. One by one their eyes glaze over and they turn limply to the head of the table, awaiting instruction. The drow allows themselves a smile that cracks their alabaster mask open around the lips.",

A cook, and more, who has sought out the strangest, finest ingredients in the world and transformed them through their own skill into wonders for the senses. Some cook to delight, some for gain or glory; yet more pursue new flavors purely for the love of the craft. Each is a unique talent whose culinary daring has turned them into experts on certain parts of the natural world",

								"The best things in life are for the bold of heart: such is as true of cooking as it is of anything else. A gourmet has the soul of a chef, but they also hold the heart of an adventurer. Their passions are combined in an endless hunt for incredible and exotic ingredients to experiment with.",
								"What sets a gourmet apart from your common-or-garden cook is their view on - or rather, disregard for - civilized boundaries. A gourmet cares not for the stifling directions of the recipe book, but seeks inspiration in bizarre and far-flung flavors. Pioneering food requires daring souls who will visit distant lands and tussle with terrible beasts, just for the chance to taste them as a well-seasoned steak. As such, gourmets maintain the same skills as traveling merchants and nomadic warriors. They are hardy folk who will happily forage grubs for weeks on end to survive, if it means an opportunity to discover a fantastic new delicacy.",

A traveling chef must be a master of the medley, using what they have to its best to provide for themselves and their companions.",
								"As gifted chefs, gourmets can draw out the nourishing powers of these diverse ingredients in ways no other can come close to, working wonders in even the most trying of conditions. They can ensure that even a single square meal a day is made to count, turning the humblest provisions into a feast that bolsters body and mind. Many adventuring bands have won the day thanks only to the skills of their stalwart cook. The lasting effects of a meal depend on the particular training and instincts of the gourmet who prepares it; but a positive review from those partaking is all but guaranteed."

The process takes 1 minute per creature, at the end of which you gain an ingredient die equal to the size of its Hit Dice.",

A meal comprises a pool of temporary hit points equal to the total number rolled on the expended ingredient dice + your Wisdom modifier. Choose any number of friendly creatures (which can include yourself) within 30 feet of you to partake of the meal. You serve a number of temporary hit points to each creature from your meal as you see fit. A single creature can gain a maximum number of temporary hit points per meal equal to 5 x your gourmet level. Temporary hit points served from your meal last until the start of a creature's next long rest.",

Adding your Wisdom modifier of 3 brings this to a total of 30 points, before you apply your Meal Multiplier for a pool totaling 60 temporary hit points. To three different creatures, you choose to grant 15, 20, and 25 temporary hit points respectively."
