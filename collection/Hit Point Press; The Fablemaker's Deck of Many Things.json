						"Welcome to the Fablemaker's Deck of Many Things, an oracle deck composed of two halves and inspired by cards from the 5e {@item deck of many things}. The first half of the deck is formed of the Overworld cards, showcasing vivid symbolism in brilliant color. The second monochrome half is made up of the Underworld cards. These black and white cards invite you to reexamine the cards' themes and dig deeper to find new answers to your questions.",
						"The deck pairs the tradition of oracle card reading with the challenging themes of the {@item deck of many things}. In this guidebook, you'll find compelling questions called Seeds of Change to help guide your mind as you consult the cards.",
						"Beautifully illustrated by Yoshi Yoshitani, the deck is also a fully functional {@item deck of many things} that can be used in your tabletop roleplaying games. The Underworld deck also has alternate rules for the {@item deck of many things}, with twenty-two new card effects that reflect each card's theme. The {@item deck of many things} is an infamous magic item, and its power to shift a game for the better or worse inspired the themes of risk and reward you'll find throughout this book. What card will you draw?",

Then, shuffle the two piles together so that half the cards are upside down and will be drawn with their imagery inverted. When cards are drawn from the deck, interpret cards drawn upright as Overworld cards and those drawn reversed as Underworld cards."

						"The 5e {@item deck of many things} is a fantastic item with powerful magic. It can change your game in an instant, for better or worse. Each card drawn from the deck immediately impacts the character who draws from it, and in some cases, it can reshape reality itself.",
						"You can use either the Overworld or Underworld half of the deck to represent this item in your games as a fun interactive tool for players. They can draw from the deck when they declare that their character will, or the Game Master (GM) can draw for them if you are playing online. The Overworld effects of the cards detailed in this booklet are the standard effects of the {@item deck of many things}.",
						"However, the Fablemaker's {@item deck of many things} offers another way to play, bringing more risk and potentially more rewards than ever. The Underworld effects are an alternate version of the {@item deck of many things}. There are several ways to include these new effects in your game. You can choose to use only the Underworld effects of the cards, or you can flip a coin to determine whether the effect of a drawn card is the standard Overworld effect or the new Underworld effect. You can also shuffle both halves together and let the luck of the draw determine the effect by applying the effect matching the card drawn. For even more customization, you can select the cards you want from the Overworld and Underworld and combine them into your own unique {@item deck of many things}.",

						"You can look up the suggested themes, keywords, and interpretations in this book for each card or follow your own intuition for what the card means to you. Consider how what the card shows you might apply to the situation for which you are seeking clarity.",

Shuffling the deck requires no special technique because the purpose is to find the card that you are most drawn to, not to randomize the cards. When you feel you are done, regroup the cards into a facedown stack.",

By drawing and comparing the two cards, you can find more than one perspective on your ques tion and perhaps an answer that balances both."

Each card presents a different solution or perspective that can be read separately or together.",
								"For example, you might ask, \"What is the best way for me to help my friend who is struggling?\" If you were to draw the Overworld Knight and the Underworld Vizier and read them separately, the Knight might suggest your friend needs you to actively support them, while the Vizier indicates that your friend needs advice.

Leaves fall from her headpiece as the wind blows back her hair. These same leaves cloak the youngest Fate, who represents our past selves and are absent from the eldest Fate, who represents our future selves. For us, the past is inflexible, but the future is not. Though change involves letting go of things we cannot alter about the past, it does not mean that the past is not still with us. The pink of the elder Fate's cloak mirrors the younger Fates's blossoms, though the color has become more nuanced with age.

										"Flames is the card of injustice, representing circumstances in which power is used to cause suffering. These systems of harm and oppression are symbolized by a giant flame-wreathed snake, its vast and tangled body reflecting the complex and interconnected legacy of injustices borne out over the ages. The fire that engulfs it demonstrates not only the harm that comes from the improper use of power but also how oppressive structures are ultimately self consuming. Power is never stable, and those who hold it would be wise to exercise it fairly, lest it become their ruin. A single firefly, bathed in resplendent light, streaks away from the monstrosity. Its flight is an act of defiance against the serpent's will, but the outcome of its escape is unclear. We may become aware of injustice, but this alone is not enough. We must strive to challenge and dismantle the unjust power structures that influence our lives, or the Flames will consume us.",

She knows that soon she can leave the forge and take her creation with her, having made what she needs to move forward.

The sword they wield is the emblem of the cause they cham pion. The golden wings on its cross guard represent swiftness and progress, and the sun that encircles its blade symbolizes the absence of ignorance. The Knight's armor protects them but does not let us see their face. What keeps us safe can also become a barrier between us. Sometimes, we need a protector, and at others, it falls to us to pick up the sword for the sake of an ally. When we gird ourselves with compassion and wield a worthy cause, we learn how to stand together against malice and cruelty.",

Desire compels us to fear loss, and in turn to hold more tightly to that which we cherish. Yet the tighter we grip a treasure, the more we risk shattering it in our grasp. The harpy's eyes are closed, and the expression on her face is one of resignation, but her talons have not yet closed on the necklace. Not all desires lead to joy.

The Vizier crosses her legs, closes her eyes, and puts her hands together as she waits for clarity. While meditating, the Vizier smiles softly to herself, comfortable in the calm environment she has created. She seeks knowledge, but she knows she already has the answer\u2014it's just a matter of locating it within herself and under standing how to act on it. This card reminds us that we can often find the answers we seek in quiet moments of solitude and reflection. The Vizier offers us her counsel and the wisdom she has gained if we are prepared to listen.",

They blend in with the Void around them, all but consumed by the swirling vortex. Even so, the trapped soul's light shines with determination, illuminating the rest of the card from its central position. Though four chains puncture the soul, only three sites of entry are bleeding, represent ing the soul's tenacity and resilience. The restraints hurt, but the soul doesn't break, for it knows that its chains can be released and it will be free one day.",
