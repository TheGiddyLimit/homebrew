					"This creature, formally known as the {@b Killer Rabbit of Caerbannog}, is one of the most feared creatures in all the land. Its call strikes fear into all that hear it, even the mightiest of dragons. Once it enters an area, the people are forced to shower it with treasure or feel the wrath of its scorn, casting the bones of the corpses it has consumed into the area around its lair. Many a foolhardy adventurer has fallen to its vengeful wrath, in which even the biggest demons lords crumple."
