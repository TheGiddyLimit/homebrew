The creature mutters in alien tongues from six yawning mouths, piping and sputtering in discordant musical tones, and lazily shifting eyes of massive size open and close throughout its bulk. Thick trunk-like tentacles reach out from its hideous stinking form to squirm and writhe around the chamber. Several appendages are wrapped around pulsing human organs: lungs, liver, kidney, a heart, a brain, and dangling amongst them is the jeweled Crown of Westemär."

Others caught in the blast were instantly transformed into monsters, and buildings and streets were shifted into sentient growths and misshapen horrors.",

The throne room where King Ulrich sat housed several of the most powerful magical relics in Westemär. The Crown of Westemär being the most prominent, although King Ulrich himself held a magical scepter, wore four magical rings, and a possessed a protective amulet. Furthermore, the large circular stained glass window behind the throne was imbued with magic that allowed it to change colors and depict different images throughout the seasons.",

King Ulrich tried to escape but the magical mayhem fused him to his throne. As the King melted, he was absorbed by the expanding flesh, his face coming to rest as a disfigured grimace placed in the center of the horrible Amalgamation.",

Tendrils of strange flesh now spread like a web of sinew and skin across the throne room while pulsing contamination ripples out of the grotesque mass. A massive maw spans the length of the creature with various human bones posing as jagged and sharp teeth. Its tongue is a writhing mass of intestines and gore. No longer can any semblance of those lost to the Amalgamation be found. The king's face still prominently sits above the creature's massive maw, a mocking display of the fragility of the empires of a world not ready to face horrors beyond their comprehension.",

A careful approach may allow one to converse with these undead. However, their speech is a convoluted mixture of half-remembered incantations, loquacious postulations, and incoherent babbling.

Some Bloated Hives have been known to respond to kind words, trinkets of their former selves, or music they recognize.

                        "This creature, which appears to be a dead horse flopped on its back, convulses and its stomach suddenly splits open, exposing its intestines and organs. Long, spindly, arachnid-like legs violently sprout from its torso as its stomach opens into a maw filled with sharp jagged teeth formed from the splayed rib cage of the beast. The horse legs limply hang in the air, as the creature skitters towards you with intense speed, intestines flapping around its maw like a sickly tongue. The head of the horse dangles lifelessly, but its mouth still gnashes and salivates acidic bile."

                "Many valiant warriors have ridden into Drakkenheim mounted on a loyal steed, not realizing that the rubble and wreckage filling the streets makes the ruins an unsuitable environment for a horse. Often, these poor animals must be abandoned not long after entering the ruins, injured from the unstable terrain. Prime targets for other predators, the horses are often tragically slaughtered. However, when their corpses are left behind, a parasite-like mutation festers within them, causing their skin to erupt with spider-like limbs, pincers, and maws.",
                "Disguising themselves as mere corpses strewn across the dark and misty streets of the ruined city, one can hardly differentiate a Bojack from a dead horse. With their spider limbs they can scurry along walls and ceilings with ease, and barely make a sound. They move with lightning-fast speed, able to scuttle across a city street in mere seconds. This terrifying speed, ease of traversing the terrain, and ability to disguise itself have made them a deadly threat to adventurers in the city.",
                "One of the most horrifying recorded encounters with Bojacks in Drakkenheim came from an early report from Hooded Lantern scouts investigating old stables south of Champion's Gate near the city outskirts. They reported finding \"piles of dead horses buzzing with large, mutated flies feasting on the meat.\" The report goes on to speak of several of the horse corpses suddenly \"bursting open\" with \"insectoid legs and a horrible maw formed from the splayed rib cage of the dead beasts.\" The report describes the speed and ferocity displayed in the immediate strike, with nearly an entire squad of eight Hooded Lantern scouts ripped to shreds in only a matter of seconds while the remaining Lanterns fled back out of the city.",
                "One of the surviving Hooded Lanterns, Sten Livingston Sr., was brave enough to volunteer to lead the following expedition into the ruins. On the road into the city a dead and bloated horse corpse lay on the side of the road. Livingston stopped his troops and approached the beast with weapons drawn, kicking the corpse to check if it would spring to life. The corpse remained motionless. It has since become a tradition spread through the Lanterns, and even into new adventuring parties, to kick the horse on the way into Drakkenheim. Many have chalked this up to a sign of good luck, not realizing the harrowing story and the lives lost that caused this strange tradition.",

The skull is severed from the body with its jaw unhinged and hanging in a horrible expression, stuck in place by the writhing vines.

Once inside, these spores can lay dormant for some time, slowly contaminating their host with internal mutation which slowly decay their flesh and bone from within, transforming it into an ideal place for the Dark Growth to germinate. When the creature succumbs to contamination, or dies with the spores within it, the plant awakens. Consuming the internal organs of the dying infected, it suddenly and violently sprouts. Often, this transformation occurs so suddenly that the creature remains walking around, the Dark Growth using the corpse as a mobile shell so it may plant in an ideal location to spread future spores.",

The knight thought little of it, suffering no immediate effects. After returning to Emberwood, the knight complained of stomach cramps, nausea, and headaches, eventually passing out from the pain. The apothecary performed an emergency surgery, cutting the patient open only to have their intestines burst out like a barrage of meaty, thorn-covered brambles that attempted to strangle the apothecary. Their intestines had been completely replaced with plant matter that had fused into their guts.",

                        "Scuttling atop dozens of spindly legs, this grotesque creature resembles a mutated centipede grown to horrific proportions. A segmented body nearly thirty feet long undulates atop unnaturally bending limbs resembling emaciated human fingers. Elongated yellow fingernails crackle and scrape the ground menacingly as it moves. Dominating its fat, round head is a single, massive human-like eye that swivels frenetically with a disturbing, unyielding intensity. Its antenna sprouts above like an eyebrow, while tightly closed mandibles resemble bags under the eye. Its foremost finger-legs end in pincer-like talons thrumming with electricity."

                "Adventurers exploring the {@link Inner City} learn to heed the sound of scraping nails—a harbinger of the Digipede's approach. Nicknamed “house” centipedes for their prodigious size, Digipedes are nightmarish creatures with a disposition toward violence. Rather than consuming their prey, they leave the bodies of their lifeless victims abandoned in the desolate city streets.",
                "How Digipedes came to be is unknown. Perhaps they originated from ordinary centipedes mutated by pools of contaminated sludge, manifesting humanlike features during their grotesque transformations. Alternatively, they may be the result of an ongoing metamorphosis, their forms continuing to twist and warp, fueled by the relentless magical forces of the Haze. A few attribute their creation to a powerful wizard hiding in the ruins known as the {@creature Pale Man}, claiming he commands them as spies and assassins. Finally, it's possible the beasts are not the product of contamination but a horrific experiment created within the Inscrutable Tower long before Drakkenheim fell.",
                "Nevertheless, a Digipede is solitary, preferring to avoid others of its kind. A few ingenious adventurers have taken advantage of this curious trait, mimicking the creature's rhythmic scraping and generating bursts of static electricity to drive them off, or even guide them toward other threats. This secret is well known to vanguards of the Hooded Lanterns, who use Digipedes as a bizarre form of pest control against other threats haunting the ruins.",

Others claim he is no ghost at all, but a living man who has been irreversibly twisted by the Haze and delirium, granting him supernatural resilience and abilities beyond mortal ken.

Instead, he manipulates fear itself, unsettling his prey until they are too rattled to think clearly, then dispatches them with sudden and overwhelming violence.
