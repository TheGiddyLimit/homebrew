Their divine powers twist and warp into dark, corrupted magic under the influence of vampiric forces.

When the creature succumbs to contamination, or dies with the spores within it, the plant awakens. Consuming the internal organs of the dying infected, it suddenly and violently sprouts.

Although various devices and contraptions were used to create distance between the death and the administer of the punishment, these hesitations and public resistance to capital punishment remained. In the Executioner, the monarchy had the perfect solution to its judicial problem: the impartial construct is no mortal, and therefore none are culpable for carrying out the death sentence. That the machine makes an impressively terrifying show of the deed was certainly not an insignificant factor either.",

Although the park existed since the city's founding, it was Helena von Kessel II, the mother of the late Ulrich IV, who ordered its redesign into the brilliance it grew to be. This redesign added tiered gardens, topiary masterpieces, cobblestone walkways, tranquil streams, and quaint waterfalls. The Queen's Park Gardens included an astounding assortment of flowers, many of which were exotic to Westemär. Even the wooded groves bustled with wildlife and an unrivaled selection of trees and bushes.

Damaged buildings are filled with rubble, prone to collapse, and the perfect places for monsters to hide in ambush.

He knew he could best most foes with brute strength, but learned to control his insatiable hunger for bloodlust to focus on the skills needed to take down larger creatures. Through patience, a skilled hand with a bow, and using tools to modify his arrows, the Lord of the Feast began proving himself the strongest and most skilled hunter of all the Garmyr.",

They speculated that Blood-Wolf called for the challenge out of fear of Ghost's burgeoning abilities and influence. Many Garmyr questioned Blood-Wolf challenging a pup half his age to a death match, but Blood-Wolf underestimated how powerful Ghost had already become. The match ended within seconds when three arrows penetrated Blood-Wolf 's chest. The first bound him in place, the second {@condition poisoned} him, and the third reeled him toward Ghost, who then tore his head off with his teeth. Holding up the head of Blood-Wolf, Ghost called for the Garmyr to feast on the corpse of their fallen leader. He was henceforth known as the Lord of the Feast.",

Its head is composed of three vermin faces with glowing purple eyes and a large central eye upon an elongated forehead. Floating above it is a halo of jagged rotating blades that drips blood down upon its head, seeping and running down its body, pouring into oblivion below. It speaks in a chorus of endless rasping voices, echoing and reverberating in pitches and tones that form words out of an auditory mosaic of scurrying rat swarms and gnawing little teeth."

				"The Star Wardens are ancient creatures who have traversed the cosmos for centuries. They care little for the multiple realities and their squabbles, nor the relevance of a mortal life. They are eternal beings who exist out of space and time. To them, relativity and dimensions are broken concepts which they can bend to their whims. They exist in multiple dimensions and times at once. They move and age in counterintuitive ways that no mortal can fully comprehend. To a mortal eye, they may appear to phase in and out of existence, or teleport from place to place, at times appearing more ancient, or more youthful. The Star Wardens may not be teleporting at all, but simply experiencing the interaction with a mortal at multiple points in time and space simultaneously. Their existence is wholly outside the standard flow of time or the movement of spatial reasoning. A Star Warden may exist within the past present and future of a mortal being all at the same time.",
				"Their physiology and bizarre existence is utterly baffling to a mortal observer. The few who have witnessed a Star Warden have gone mad by the sheer incomprehensibility of their existence. One such academy mage, Randolf Carter, who practiced entering the Space Between Worlds via Dreamland, said that at several points throughout his life, he has spoken to a Star Warden. From the Star Warden's perspective, their conversation was a singular event, yet for Randolf, it happened in tiny dream-like snippets over the course of 50 years.",
				"The Star Wardens shepherd the cosmos, observing and aiding in the flow of space and time. They view reality as a wavelength of interdimensional strands, and they see to the various timelines and branches of infinite realities. It is impossible to know the full scope of their purpose, but they seem to be protectors of timelines, and ensure no cataclysmic events cause the universe to collapse on itself.",

When delerium is left uncontained in massive quantities, it is possible it can slowly grow and seep into the heart of an entire planet, eventually rotting the core. The entire surface becomes a wasteland of octarine crystals as big as buildings, with a Haze-covered sky of eldritch storm clouds that blacks out the sun. Under these conditions, {@condition contamination|MonstersOfDrakkenheim} runs rampant and no lifeform on the surface is free from endless mutation. As the planet festers and mutates to the point of destruction, the Haze and delerium cause all manner of abominations to grow and change. Given the hundreds of years it takes for delerium to infect an entire planet, the mutated monstrosities have ample time to grow to massive proportions. This creature is but the first of many which could be created if the Academy is not able to contain and control delerium.",
								"Eventually however, the delerium begins to expand at an increased rate, and some of these creatures end up encased in the eldritch crystals, being forced into a state of hibernation. When the planet is fully contaminated, it explodes sending massive chunks of contaminated rock through the cosmos. Some of these meteors have mutated monstrosities housed within their cores, waiting for a time to break free upon a new contaminated world. We have received the remnants of a distant dead world, and we must contain it before the same thing happens to ours.",

The Knights have a blunt theory about how it was created: it's just another big mutant caused by the eldritch {@condition contamination|MonstersOfDrakkenheim} of delerium. They cite the many documented instances when destroying or damaging a large cluster of delerium caused rifts between the planes or sudden surges of eldritch {@condition contamination|MonstersOfDrakkenheim}. If the Delerium Heart is the largest piece of delerium ever encountered, then it stands to reason that shattering it would cause the largest {@table Arcane Anomalies|MonstersOfDrakkenheim} ever known.

Its fur seems to absorb light, creating a silhouette that shifts and wavers, as if its true form is utterly incomprehensible to your mind. The creature's striking eyes are large, luminous orbs that resemble nebulae, surging with vibrant colors that no earthly cat's eyes would possess. Its paws are tipped with claws made of a material resembling a dark, glassy substance, capable of tearing through the fabric of reality itself. Each step it takes resonates with a soft, eerie echo, as if it walks not just on the physical ground, but also treads through the layers of time and space. Its tail is elongated and flexible, flickering through the air like a dark, wraithlike appendage, constantly moving in patterns that defy the bounds of physical space."

They displace themselves constantly within an area, appearing in multiple places nearly at the same time, or teleporting from one location to another constantly.

My name is Pluto Jackson and I am the greatest threat to the monsters of Westemär and beyond. This is my book entirely written by me! Well, it was written by some lowly scholar but completely guided and dictated by me. In it, you will find a compendium of truths and treasures about the greatest foes found throughout the known worlds. I have walked, run, flown, jumped, and fallen through portals and pathways to discover the intricate understanding of how these foes are put together and more importantly how to pull them apart.",

I have ventured into forests to hunt my troll rivals. I have crossed barriers into places where time moves in all directions. I have found myself fighting off dark creatures with a strange fascination with my neck. I have even spent entirely too much time breathing in the toxic air of Drakkenheim\u2014all so I could bring this great knowledge to you.",

No matter for a Caspian with a quick sword. Although it reminded me of the endless battles with Hydras. You attack one long limb and suddenly two more in its place! This is why we hate math! The delerium spreads quickly and even the most gentle creatures turn into nightmarish abominations! I watched a soldier of Caspia get eaten by his own rations.

						"Though it was a metropolis of over a hundred thousand people, only a few hundred escaped Drakkenheim in the days following the disaster. Trembling as they spoke, these survivors recounted how they narrowly avoided the fire and ash that consumed the city, only to watch in horror as their loved ones, neighbors, and fellow citizens were twisted into grotesque parodies of themselves by the chaotic energies that followed the falling stars. All agreed that the only lucky ones that day were those who were swiftly incinerated in the initial meteoric impact. Ever since, those who perish within Drakkenheim or succumb to the contaminated Haze transform into hideous monsters.",
						"Those who dismissed these claims as the distressed inventions of a few traumatized refugees were decisively proven wrong in the years following the disaster. Seeking to restore order as quickly as possible, the nobility of Westemär desperately mustered an expeditionary force to search Drakkenheim for royal survivors, recover the lost crown, and retake Castle Drakken. {@creature Lord Commander Elias Drexel|MonstersOfDrakkenheim} was placed in command of the mission, hand-picking a contingent of fifty elite House von Kessel soldiers to be the first team dispatched into the ruins. {@creature Captain Ansom Lang|MonstersOfDrakkenheim} was appointed to lead the squadron.",
						"Although they were well-equipped veterans, this conventional military force was wholly unprepared for the conditions in the ruins. Arriving on the outskirts of the city, the troops found Drakkenheim cloaked in a thick opalescent fog, which came to be known as {@area the Haze|8dd|x}. When the mists did not abate, the soldiers cautiously proceeded into the ruins from the south, making their way along Champion's Way. The details are unclear about what exactly occurred next, since only a few scrawled notes from Captain Lang's logbook were ever found from that first mission.",
						"Lang records that a few among their number began to fall ill shortly after entering the ruins and encountering a \"gigantic and misshapen rodent\" of some kind. Nevertheless, the unit pushed onward and ran afoul of \"a throng of reanimated dead shuffling the streets.\" Lang notes that many were wounded in the battle against the undead after the creatures \"violently exploded with some kind of strangely-colored magic\" when slain. At that, the regiment decided to stop and rest to help their comrades recover. While making camp, a few of the soldiers presented Lang with \"brightly glowing gemstones, which glimmered like nothing from this world\" that they'd found amongst the rubble. Lang explains how he confiscated the stones, keeping them on his person \"for safety, lest the troops get ideas about looting.\"",
						"However, the soldiers were unable to sleep, haunted by whispers and nightmares of something in the swirling darkness. More began to fall sick, and that's when the changes began. One of the wounded soldiers started convulsing violently as their arms transformed into flailing tentacles, and their stomach opened into a gaping, toothy maw. Unsure what to do, a panicked Lang had \"no other choice but to slay the poor wretch.\" At that point, Lang's writing becomes less clear, as he explains the affliction spreading amongst his soldiers taking hold in himself. That was the final entry in his log. The scribbled notebook was found by adventurers some years later amidst the remains of a terrible shapeless mass of monstrous flesh and limbs. None from Lang's unit ever returned from the ruins.",
						"Since that time, many expeditions and adventuring parties have met a similar fate to Lang's unit, and rarely are records or remains ever found. However, a few were far more fortunate and returned from their missions. Through these few successes, the world was able to learn about the horrors of Drakkenheim, and the vast power\u2014and danger\u2014of delerium.",

								"We were crossing the river on the eastern outskirts, making our way up King's Road. As we approached the Drann, Faraday spotted strange eggs along the shore, colored unlike anything we had seen before. Similar, I think, to the fog hanging over the ruined city. Collins said they reminded him of tadpole eggs he saw as a child. We heard a low gurgling noise from the river and drew our bows. Collins was hit with one of the strange eggs. We saw a figure lurking in the water and unleashed our arrows at it, but it vanished beneath the surface. The egg that hit Collins had stuck to his neck. He was on the ground, writhing in discomfort. Faraday examined the egg, which had seemingly fused to Collin's flesh, appearing like a strange pulsing growth.",
								"We were hesitant to attempt to remove it, and that hesitancy may be what cost Collins his life. I can't say for sure what happened next. We continued to travel towards King's Gate, keeping an eye on Collins, who claimed he felt alright; we would drop him off at a nearby Lantern waypoint to seek medical attention. Faraday observed a small creature within the egg, possibly a tadpole, disappear into Collins's neck as the egg merged even further. Collins lost consciousness only a minute or two later, and moments after that, began convulsing. His skin turned strange hues of yellow and green, his eyes grew pale, and he began to bleed from sores that appeared across his body. As we attempted to staunch the bleeding and tend to his ailments, Collins was lost to the disease that had quickly overtaken him. As we came to terms with losing one of our own to such bizarre circumstances, horrible events began to occur.",
								"It's difficult to describe what happened to Collins's body. His skin began to writhe, and crack. His ribcage ripped open as a large frog emerged, its face split down the middle with a strange maw. It let out a horrible croak and leapt past us. We unleashed multiple arrows at the creature until it fell. Approaching the creature's body, we saw that it had already begun producing its own eggs, likely to use on the rest of us. However, the most unsettling thing was that its eyes were strangely familiar. They reminded me of Collins's."

These energies also manifest the misty Haze that covers the city. Sustained exposure to this raw magic causes all matter to warp erratically. While living animal tissue is readily susceptible to contamination, over time even plant and vegetable matter, dead flesh, solid rock, metal, and even the elements themselves are affected by delerium. Overexposure to eldritch contamination induces a chain reaction of rapid mutation which changes humans, animals, and even inanimate objects into terrifying monsters in a painful and gory process. As the body betrays itself, the mind slowly unravels. A monstrous transformation drives even the most strong-willed individuals irrevocably mad, though a few retain a distorted facade of their intelligence and personality. Each creature described in this chapter has suffered this terrible fate.",
								"The mutations caused by eldritch contamination are endless in possibility, and do not conform to any need for biological function or natural law. There is no telling what strange appendages, odd shapes, and unnatural abilities a contaminated creature could possess. While some mutations make for a fearsome abomination, many mutated creatures become a pathetic lump of flesh barely able to support their own misshapen bodies.

Worse, even plant life has gained otherworldly sentience, animated by the eldritch forces taking root in the soil. Although monsters have always been known to exist, these horrific nightmares are unlike anything seen in any other place on this world.",

						"When a human is exposed to enough eldritch contamination to cause a monstrous transformation, the ensuing cascade of mutations most commonly results in a horrific mockery of their former selves. Countless inhabitants of Drakkenheim have suffered this horrible fate, transformed after the meteor fell. Others are fallen soldiers, lost adventurers, or faction agents who never escaped the ruins. Survivors and explorers often refer to these creatures as \"wretches,\" \"unfortunates,\" \"the lost ones,\" but they are most commonly known as Delerium Dregs.",
						"These monsters are hideously transfigured in both body and mind. They are trapped in a terrifying landscape filled with delusions and torment, left with only fragmented memories, unable to comprehend what has happened to them. Delerium Dregs have been driven mad by their transformations.",
						"Occasionally, a Delerium Dreg may still be recognizable to their friends and loved ones, but are so stricken with madness that little remains of their former personalities. Others have changed so much they bear no resemblance to their former selves, though most retain some humanoid features and body proportions. No matter how they ended up in this horrific form, they are doomed to wander the ruins, disorientation occasionally wavering into anguish, distress, or violent outbursts.",

								"No two Delerium Dregs are exactly alike, as all are transformed in chaotic and unpredictable ways. Their bodies sprout all manner of twisted limbs, spines, and bones. Their organs, muscles, and flesh are resculpted, their faces twisted painfully into terrifying visages. Nevertheless, there are several recognizable and relatively common variations which all express a differing degree of danger to those exploring Drakkenheim.",
								"Those who have studied eldritch contamination and mutations have theorized that certain factors may influence the types of mutations a contaminated individual may manifest. Perhaps the subject's physical or biological traits are the determining factor, especially in those who may already possess magical talents or who have been touched by arcane forces in some way. It may also be that the environment and conditions under which an individual gains {@area Contamination|8c6|x} affect the forms they develop, as {@creature Bloated Dreg|MonstersOfDrakkenheim|Bloated Dregs} appear more commonly near flooded regions, and {@creature Lambent Dreg|MonstersOfDrakkenheim|Lambent Dregs} are more common near the crater. It is also entirely possible it is all simply chaotic magic, and any patterns are mere coincidence.",
								"Indeed, a {@creature Delerium Dreg|MonstersOfDrakkenheim} continues to mutate with continued exposure to eldritch contamination. Over time, the typical Delerium Dreg described here may change into one of the other forms. However, these continued mutations may eventually cause their form to destabilize, transforming them into a {@creature Protean Abomination|MonstersOfDrakkenheim} or {@creature Pyknic Maunder|MonstersOfDrakkenheim}.",

Consequently, they do not consume the bodies of their victims; rather, they attack out of madness-induced aggression. As such, a Delerium Dreg won't be lured into a trap by meat and usually can't be bargained with using food."

More than once have well-intentioned individuals sought out a transformed friend or loved one and tried to coax them back into a cogent state, grasping at whatever shreds of humanity remain. Unfortunately, these attempts ultimately fail; at best gleaning a fleeting moment of recognition before the terrifying realization of their wretched state becomes apparent.

An individual ratling is far from the most fearsome threat in Drakkenheim, but these verminous multitudes present a creeping, gnawing danger that could one day grow beyond any other.",

								"Ratlings begin their lives as ordinary rats. Born in the contaminated sewers and subterranean tunnels of Drakkenheim, their pups feed on carrion tainted with eldritch contamination. The continual ingestion of delerium accelerates their development and mutation, allowing a ratling pup to reach maturity in just a few weeks. A ratling can live for five to seven years, although many die from infighting or accidents within their first year or two.",
								"Granted a warped intellect by delerium, ratlings suffer from a constant internal struggle between their cowardly survival instincts and violent and impulsive urges. Ratlings dream of eating everything, and will eat anything, but especially love eating people. They have acquired an appetite for humans that are easy to capture, kill, and devour such as children and the elderly, and especially babies. While they can subsist on carrion, ratlings prefer fresh meat, and will take captives back to their lairs.",
								"Despite their innate madness and violent predilections, ratlings are industrious and will fashion makeshift gear from scavenged equipment, favoring long knives, rusty spears, slings, and crossbows. They rarely wear armor, although they have been known to strap scrap metal pauldrons or an occasional breastplate onto their matted fur. Ratlings sometimes carry makeshift shields that once were shutters, tabletops, or parts of a door to defend themselves. Crafty and resourceful, a rare few ratlings have even learned to master the contaminated magic that created them, becoming powerful spellcasters.",

										"Ratlings display inherent naivety towards basic human concepts, especially kindness, empathy, and bravery. Many adventurers have made a grave mistake thinking ratlings are simple-minded fools. While ratlings care little for the lives of others, they value their own hide above all and will do just about anything to survive. Most are cowards who will flee at the first sign of a losing battle, willing to throw their best friend in the way of a hungry gator, a swarm of harpies, or a battle-ready group of adventurers if it ensures their own escape. When cornered or trapped, ratlings often break down in tears to beg for their lives, and offer delerium, information, or help infiltrating or sneaking through the city in exchange for their life. Those who have survived the longest usually become cunning warriors and clan leaders, and tend to develop skills in manipulation, lying, and bargaining.",
										"Occasionally, adventurers exploring Drakkenheim make deals with ratlings they capture to act as guides into more treacherous parts of the city. Almost every time, the ratling eventually attempts a horrible betrayal. Ratlings are always waiting for the moment they can turn the situation in their favor, and lead their enemies into an ambush, or deliver them to the lair of a much more horrible monster."

The biggest ratling usually leads the pack, though in some cases the smartest and most cunning can find themselves as leaders as well. Individual ratlings easily recognize others from their colony by scent, a trait which often foils adventurers trying to use disguises or trickery to infiltrate ratling burrows.",
										"However, ratling colonies are quite hostile to each other, fighting over food and territory. Indeed, ratlings spend more time fighting each other than any other creatures or factions in the ruins, which is probably why they haven't taken over Drakkenheim yet. Successful colonies grow in number rapidly, as ratlings mature in a matter of weeks when ample food and delerium are available. The largest and most powerful ratling colonies bully others into submission and rule over them. Fortunately, intense competition with other ratling colonies over a limited food supply, predation from other monsters, and constant clashes with explorers and the Hooded Lanterns keeps their population in check. Lacking these constraints, their numbers would quickly swell beyond all hope of containment."

It's the ratlings' obsession with delerium that generally causes them to forgo their inherent cowardice in exchange for wild aggression.

These special circumstances have produced several unique groups of monsters which operate in a much more unified and coherent fashion\u2014at least, compared to the ravening horrors and Delerium Dregs wandering the Haze. Initially banding together with others in order to survive, the most successful packs have carved out their own domains and territories within the ruined streets of Drakkenheim. Each has proven their mettle in battle against each other, the Hooded Lanterns, and expeditionary groups alike, each securing their own niche within the predatory hierarchy of the ruins.",

In addition, contaminated energies have even gripped the old statues and defensive guardians of the city, granting these constructs a malign sentience.",

Centuries ago, the reigning monarch of Drakkenheim, Hildegarde von Drakken I, secretly used the power of the {@item Crown of Westemär|MonstersOfDrakkenheim} to bring these statues to life to serve as protectors for the city. These magical constructs were bound to the will of the monarch, but also answered to the commands of any who bore one of the six Seals of Westemär.

Experience and curiosity inspire apothecaries to experiment, seeking out new knowledge and advanced techniques.",
						"Well-intentioned exploration turns to dark practice when an apothecary discovers that the same magic that repairs the body can also reanimate dead flesh, transmogrify muscle and bone, animate inorganic matter, manipulate the mind, and even create new life. It begins in small ways: the apothecary offers an experimental concoction made from dangerous materials to a desperate patient, or transplants body parts harvested from the dead to save a grievously wounded friend. Perhaps next they attempt to reanimate a beloved pet, create a laboratory assistant from mud and chemicals, or use a new technique to gently dissuade local authorities from investigating their laboratories. Most stop there, content to close the book on their occult discoveries and return to more humble and reliable methods. However, unforeseen circumstances or boundless ambition drive a rare few to take these studies even further; to push the boundaries of science and magic with no regard for ethics, morals, or safety.",

Even after their creators are brought to justice, the horrors they created remain hiding in the dark corners of villages, in underground lairs beneath cities, or in secret and forgotten laboratories.",

Tales spread around campfires and amongst children that tell of the things that go bump in the night: stitched-together corpses, their limbs replaced with medical instruments; grave-robbing body-snatchers stealing away in the dead of night; strange monstrosities lurking in the shadows seeking fresh victims; and patients who got more than they bargained for in a desperate plea for help.",

When these methods are not enough, they use arcane magic and eldritch forces to restore their patients. Apothecary magic revolves around the body: healing it with tinctures, modifying it via transmogrification or psychoactive compounds, or harming it with poisons and diseases.",

While their magic isn't forbidden, the Amethyst Academy does not take kindly to magical instruction outside their schools. Thus, knowledge about apothecary magic has spread largely in secret. These desperate circumstances have often inspired less ethical apothecaries to carry out unsavory magic and methods to continue their research, gain power, and protect themselves and their techniques."

Working in hiding for almost a decade, the guild instructed promising students in occult magic and repurposed the subterranean chambers below the Lena Leuven Laboratory of Medicine and Natural Philosophy into an extensive secret school and lab.",

Liberio is a mercantile crossroads; apothecaries here have no trouble procuring rare ingredients and materials, especially those of a less-than-legal nature thanks to the smuggling and piracy flowing from the city across the Middle Sea.",

Interestingly, occultists in the city find working under the Academy's nose beneficial. First, the mages' presence means that willing adventurers and rare curiosities pass through the city regularly, especially delerium. Second, Academy mages seem to tolerate apothecaries in Liberio, unwilling to disturb the peace where their great stronghold sits. Indeed, it's not unknown for apothecaries and Academy guildmages to gather, trade, and occasionally collaborate here.",

						"Hidden within the political squabbles of the continental nobility is an ancient conspiracy swathed in darkness and bound by blood. A few highborn houses have been ruled by vampires for centuries, their family leaders gifted with undead immortality yet cursed with sanguine cravings. Secretly preying upon their mortal subjects whilst concealing their undead nature from their noble peers, these vampire lords have in turn transformed their heirs, lieutenants, courtesans, and staff into obedient spawn to secure their lineage and loyalty.",
						"Yet their dark ambitions do not end there, for the vampire aristocrats desire complete control and total domination over the people of the continent. Together, thirteen vampire-ruled noble houses established a sinister cabal and shadow government collectively known as the Court of the Night, a shadowy alliance that aims to influence and manipulate political affairs and eventually seize power. The Court of the Night works in the shadows, pulling noble puppet strings across the continent. Originally founded in the kingdom of Westemär, the Court of the Night's influence has spread, infiltrating the noble ranks of neighboring lands such as Caspia and Elyria.",
						"The elusive vampires have managed to keep their plot undiscovered for hundreds of years. During this time, however, a few amongst the court and even entire vampire households have been exposed\u2014sometimes by intrepid monster hunters, other times by the devout paladins of the Silver Order, or occasionally by the mages of the Amethyst Academy, or astute mortal nobles. While many exposed vampires have been eradicated, others have managed to escape and reestablish themselves elsewhere under new identities.",
						"The few mortals who have come dangerously close to unraveling the full extent of the vampire conspiracy have faced grim fates. Some have disappeared without a trace, swallowed by the shadows that cloak the Court of the Night's operations. These unfortunate souls stumbled too deep into the vampires' secrets, provoking a lethal response to ensure their silence. Others, however, suffer a fate arguably worse than death: they are captured and transformed into thralls by the vampires. Stripped of their will and enslaved, these thralls serve their vampire masters, their former lives obliterated by vampiric compulsion and dark magic. This sinister practice ensures not only the continuation of the vampire's secrecy but also a sadistic reinforcement of their dominance over humans.",
						"However, within the secretive bounds of the Court of the Night, an atmosphere of constant suspicion and ambition breeds endless betrayal and intrigue. The vampire households, each led by ancient and cunning undead lords, vie fiercely for influence and control. Alliances are as fleeting as they are strategic, formed to stabilize power or to execute swift betrayals when advantageous. The stakes of this internal power struggle are exceedingly high, as supremacy within the Court can grant unparalleled control over both the vampire and human realms. These internal conflicts often manifest in covert sabotages, assassinations, and intricate plots that further complicate the dynamics within the Court, making the hierarchy within this shadow government both volatile and deadly.",

Ancient stories amongst those who keep the Old Faith attribute the curse to the fickle goddesses Morrigan, who laid the punishment upon heretical druids blasphemously seeking immortality in her name. Amongst the Faith of the Sacred Flame, vampirism represents a twisted and fallen soul utterly consumed by darkness and bloody impulses, one so completely shunned by the light they are destroyed by its very presence.",
								"Though vampirism is unquestionably a curse, it is one that brings great power through unnatural abilities. As such, ambitious mortals have themselves often sought out the curse willingly. Unscrupulous warlocks have made dark pacts with demonic entities and become vampires in the process. Indeed, the tyrannical Sorcerer-Kings were masters of blood magic, wielding dark power to imbue their bloodlines with draconic and fiendish lineages. Many amongst them sought to establish an eternal empire through some form of immortality. Academy scholars speculate that several Sorcerer-Kings attained undeath through vampirism or lichdom, though their dreams of everlasting rule ended in betrayal by their own rivals.",
								"As the Faith of the Sacred Flame rose in Elyria, these vampires and surviving blood mages fled its spreading light for other lands where they could more safely hide in the shadows. Meanwhile, in the deep forests of the lands which would one day become Westemär, descendants of the druids cursed by Morrigan still practiced their sanguine rites in secret, until a bloodthirsty ruler emerged who sought their cursed power for himself.",
								"The legendary Vladimir von Drakken was a peerless swordman and ruthless warlord born in the late sixth century, who forged the nation of Westemär through bloody conquest over three decades of brutal invasion. Vladimir von Drakken carved a gore-streaked path through his neighbors and built a kingdom born out of genocidal massacres and brutal subjugation. He established himself as the Lord of Castle Drakken, naming Drakkenheim for his household. History tells that Vladimir von Drakken ruled as a despot and had imperial ambitions upon his neighbors in Elyria and Caspia. However, he was cut down by his rebellious daughter, Carmen, who succeeded her father's throne. While sensational stories about Vladimir von Drakken's bloodthirsty nature are scrawled into the margins of history, no records remain that tell the full story: Vladimir von Drakken was in fact a powerful ascendant vampire.",
								"Two decades into his conquests, Vladimir von Drakken became paranoid that he would be betrayed and usurped by one of his lieutenants, or worse, by one of his own family members. Fearing his own death most of all, he sought out forbidden magic to grant him power and immortality. He found it in the form of vampirism. Deep within the Brachenwald, he was transformed in an unholy ritual known as the Sanguine Rite.",
								"When he returned to Castle Drakken, Vladimir von Drakken turned his vassals into vampire spawn so that none could ever stand against him, holding them as thralls in his Court of the Night. Over the next ten years, he continued his cruel and merciless campaign to dominate the lands of Westemär and beyond. Although he was struck down by his daughter, many members of his Court of the Night survived to carry on his legacy.",

During the founding decades of the Court, the families gathered in the Brachenwald of Westemär, at the ancient grove where the Druids of Morrigan transformed Vladimir von Drakken into a vampire. However, a more organized and central location space was needed as the vampiric court grew and the families spread throughout the continent and beyond.",

The cosmopolitan port and independent city-state is located on the Middle Sea, and represents a melting pot between the major nations of the continent. Given its inherent bustle of travel and trade, Liberio is no stranger to fantastic sights and sounds. Visitors from faraway places, mages, and all sorts of strange folk and adventurous types gather in the democratic city. Vampires can easily conceal their presence here and find no shortage of activities or appetizers during the warm nights in Liberio.",
										"Each vampire family dispatches a delegation to attend once every thirteen years to discuss the next steps for the court. Though they often send grand contingents of vampires, spawn, and thralls, each family chooses two representatives to speak on their behalf. The vampires meet for nights, punctuated with dark revelry, macabre masquerades, and grisly feats which stretch into the long hours of the night. During these events, the vampires openly discuss their plots, their triumphs, their struggles, and how their goals may further the Court of the Night's longevity and prosperity. They review their plots and deception for their continued infiltration of the Mortal World.",
										"Amongst the vampires, the Calling of the Court is a neutral ground, where all families must put aside infighting, backstabbing, past betrayals, and schemes against each other under penalty of true death. Yet, the vampires are conniving and clever\u2014the Calling of the Court is the time to strengthen their shared goals and gain the support they need. If a rival or two can be eliminated before or after the gathering itself... so much the better.",

Yet, the Druids of the Sanguine Rite are remembered as outcasts and blasphemers amongst many of Morrigan's worshippers even today, and so it's possible the knowledge they possessed came from another, darker source, an evil power that finds joy and mirth in death and the macabre: the demonic entity known as {@creature He Who Laughs Last|MonstersOfDrakkenheim}.",

Other stories say that trolls are a curse sent by a vengeful Faerie King or Queen for some half-remembered trespass made by mortals millennia ago. Perhaps foolish warlocks accidentally summoned the trolls here in attempts to bargain with their patrons, opening rifts that allowed entities from the Otherworlds to enter the Material Plane.

						"Even the most learned sages and mightiest archmages of the Amethyst Academy understand little about the realms beyond the Mortal World. Through centuries of research, a few have gleaned scraps of knowledge, as scholars attempt to catalog the planes and discover the means to reach them. It is known that beyond the Mortal World are countless planes, side realms, and parallel dimensions: the verdant Faerie Otherworlds, the grim Shadowlands, the fuming Elemental Planes, and more. Though few mortals ever visit these other worlds, their influence permeates the material plane through magic and creatures that slip though the metaphysical veil that separates one reality from the next. However, sewn within the seams of the planar fabric is a realm unto itself, one more incomprehensible and bizarre than any other: the roiling non-place known as the Space Between Worlds.",
						"The Space Between Worlds is a tumultuous expanse of raw magical potential, a surreal landscape where crystalline obelisks rise at bewildering angles beneath a sun shaped like a square circle setting into an endless horizon. This horizon never touches the psychedelic, octarine sky. Logic and reason fade from meaning and the paradoxical reigns\u2014here chaos and order are one and the same.",
						"Often thought of as the borderland between planes, or a void that collects the detritus of failed realities, broken timelines, annihilated universes, and collapsing dimensions, the Space Between Worlds is believed to be the source of all arcane magic, and metaphysically connected to every other plane. In this endless tundra of incomprehensible chaos, creatures beyond mortal understanding glide through the void or linger within pockets of semi-coherent reality. Void pirates navigate the cosmic seas, while elder beings traverse shattered dimensions. Sentient planets engage in celestial wars across a nebulous cosmic landscape, and inscrutable entities study and abduct mortals for obscure purposes. Within this tumultuous realm, various self-proclaimed gods manipulate mortal lives, viewing them as trivial playthings. To these beings, mortals represent mere ephemeral and erratic blips in the vast, ever-shifting expanse of the universe.",
						"These few scraps of information are the totality known to mortal scholars in the World of Drakkenheim about the Space Between Worlds. The remaining information on the Space Between Worlds is for the heroes to discover themselves during play.",
						"Conventional understandings of space, time, and causality do not necessarily apply in the Space Between Worlds. Indeed, the foundational laws of logic itself do not hold here. The entire Space Between Worlds is a contradiction unbound; the excluded middle made manifest; a place where whatever is, is not, and is also something else, and that which is not, is. The realm is spatially multi-dimensional, extending into the fourth, fifth, sixth, and potentially infinite spatial dimensions. Similarly, time flows freely forwards, backwards, stands still, accelerates, and slows down. Finite mortal creatures confined to three spatial dimensions and a linear timeline cannot experience the full spatial and temporal breadth of the Space Between Worlds in its utterly infinite potential. Within the Space Between Worlds, everything extends endlessly everywhere all at once, while being simultaneously compressed into a singularity.",
						"The Amethyst Academy mages Adama Borgess and Killgar Copperpot as well as apothecary Mathias van Buskirk were leading minds in the study and understanding of the Space Between Worlds. The deeper these brilliant minds delved into the knowledge of the Space Between Worlds, the more they began to lapse from reality. Copperpot died after his breakthrough into understanding the entities of the realm. Borgess published multiple books on the topic, each more esoteric and confused than the last. In his final years, he became reclusive and isolated, speaking at length about dimensions and reality in an increasingly confounded manner. Van Buskirk is a modern practitioner and is still alive today. His study is focused on Thin Places, and the entities that emerge through them, dealing with the protection of our realm from such creatures.",
						"Beyond these brilliant minds, other entities exist that have a firm grasp of the Space Between Worlds, but these entities are just as rare to encounter as the realm itself. What secrets these incredible beings of vast intellect may know they care little to share with mortals. Three such entities have a deep understanding of the nature of the Space Between Worlds. The first is {@creature Eldritch Troll|MonstersOfDrakkenheim|Eldritch Trolls}. Second is {@creature He Who Laughs Last|MonstersOfDrakkenheim}, the demon lord from the Hells speculated to have existed since the origin of time, and destined to be the last creature to exist at the end of all things. Last is Amaranthyst, The Ultraviolet, archmage of the Amethyst Academy Directorate, a being who transcends time and space. There might be other incomprehensible entities that traverse the Space Between Worlds and know it as no others could, but those entities are beyond a mortal's perception and understanding.",

Under their utterly baffling model, the entire multiverse\u2014all planes of existence, timelines, and worlds\u2014are merely thought of as \"islands of order within a sea of chaos.\" Borgess theorized that the fate of such islands is inevitably to be broken down and consumed, returning to primal chaos.

A form of concentrated raw arcane power turned into a solid form, delerium is an inevitable constant in a realm of churning arcane power. Growths of it dot every landscape and structure found in the realm, and in other regions it dominates the terrain, shaped like colossal mountains, crystalline forests, octarine obelisks, and strange edifices. Entire planetoids of delerium drift through the void. Delerium may have very well originated from the Space Between Worlds, shifting into the various realms and realities through Thin Places, or arcane gates.",

Adama Borgess's theory suggests that delerium is the inevitable return to chaos that all realities will eventually suffer. The process of returning order to its natural state of chaos is caused by the swirling arcane void and delerium is simply a catalyst for this destruction caused by the inherent nature of magic itself. The realms floating within the Space Between Worlds are at all times deathly contaminated, and it is perhaps the epicenter of the chaotic whims of contamination."

Other spellcasters may seek forbidden lore from them via magic like the {@spell Contact Other Plane|XPHB} spell. Perhaps some of these entities may have come to mortals in ancient days and made some of the first warlock pacts which brought magic to the Mortal World.",

Their plans and machinations stretch on for countless mortal lifetimes, and so these ancient entities often appear to adventurers as patient patrons, offering information, aid, magical powers, and insights. However, they extract their own costs, for these entities seldom share human values, instead following their own amoral principles and alien perspectives.

Other beings ultimately desire the destruction or domination of the Mortal World\u2014such as {@creature He Who Laughs Last|MonstersOfDrakkenheim} and the {@creature Rat God|MonstersOfDrakkenheim}\u2014but those plans are centuries from fruition and will come at a time when no heroes live to oppose them. Even if the player characters manage to slay one of these beings, such an event is ultimately an insignificant setback to their longstanding plans.",

Not only do they make excellent patrons for warlocks of all stripes and great targets for the {@spell Contact Other Plane|XPHB} spell, roleplaying interactions with the Ancient Entities are also delightful opportunities to test the principles and desires of the player characters. These Ancient Entities can offer the player characters shortcuts to knowledge and power if the characters are willing to make bargains or pacts with terrifying eldritch creatures. These entities could offer characters the chance to \"correct\" a past mistake, or a direct path to achieve a key objective related to their personal quests\u2014but the possible cost and consequences should give the heroes pause.",
								"All you need to do is place a statue, shrine, mysterious portal, or magic circle along the adventurers' path to facilitate a telepathic interaction between the entity and the player characters. Play to the characters' desires, fears, ambitions, and regrets. Cryptically offer them everything they want and more, but without answers or explanations. Take delight in playing the entities with a sense of alien distance, nonchalant superiority, and arrogant assurance. After all, the heroes are but insignificant pawns in a grand game for them\u2014and all the characters' struggles and victories aren't even a key play in the overall strategy for these enigmatic beings.",

They place scouts in ruined buildings to keep eyes on the streets and run for aid if a combat breaks out. The Lanterns lay traps and ambushes before their enemies have entered the area. Hooded Lanterns are often incredibly prepared and use the ruins as camouflage for their attack."

We felt that the fun of this system would be spoiled with restrictions to prevent economic abuse. We didn't want an overly analytical approach to get in the way of fun.

								"A special thanks to our fellow Dungeon Dudes, players, and best friends, Jill Danaitis and Joe O'Gorman, whose contributions to our world and lore enrich every game we play. Joe, in particular, was instrumental in this book's creation as the original Pluto Jackson, providing all the quotes and the introductory letter within. We also want to acknowledge Kyle Drier, whose tireless work behind the scenes keeps us organized and on schedule, and our amazing brand manager, Bettie Rage, whose dedication and guidance ensured consistency and focus during crucial moments of this project.",
								"Bringing to life the vast array of monsters in this book and pushing the boundaries of combat design with new conditions and epic bosses was no small task. We couldn't have done it without the invaluable playtesting and feedback from our community and backers. A heartfelt thanks to our incredible Alpha Team\u2014Benjamin Burt, Bill Goldschmidt, Brooke Rader, Corline Hazenoot, and Samuel Cavender\u2014for their dedication to refining and strengthening this project. To every backer who took the time to share thoughtful and honest feedback, and to our amazing viewers and Patreon supporters who have allowed us to come as far as we have as creators, we are truly grateful.",
								"Lastly, to our loving partners, Kierston Drier and Shay Bytheway\u2014your endless love, encouragement, and patience through the many late nights of writing and development did not go unnoticed. We are so thankful for your unwavering support.",
