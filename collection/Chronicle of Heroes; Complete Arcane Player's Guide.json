						"It begins with a subtle question. What are we? Where can we go? What are we meant to be? Those are things many young aspiring practitioners asked, before discovering the only means for an answer: the Art.",
						"The Art of arcane magic has been honed for millenia in Kyrmoria. Ancient civilizations rose and fell, some due to conflicting interests and thirst for power that drove them to infighting, some others due to extraordinary yet devastating experiments.",
						"Nowadays, in times of peace, theologists and scholars of the arcane alike debate constantly over the origin of arcana. Devotees of the divine claim it was a gift bestowed upon mortals by Temporus, the deity of time and magic, while mages support the idea of the mortal claim, the fact that magic was always there, embracing us through the Weave. We just had to understand it in order to manipulate it.",
						"Historically, there have been, as is to be expected, great leaps in the development of the Art in times of war. The Dragon War saw many powerful archmages rise and fall, ultimately culminating with the elven archmage Elbalar sacrificing himself in the Nexus of Time to shift the current timeline and alter reality, successfully, for the time being, avoiding a material and celestial plane wide apocalypse.",
						"It is the writer's conviction, as Elbalar's student, that magic is not panacea. A mage's duty is to influence the world, to pursue truths and knowledge as a tool of understanding. As alluring as the concept of the True Magic is, one should tread carefully and with responsibility regarding their craft's use.",
						"After the Sundering, magic has been.. unstable. Even wizards of the highest caliber exercise patience for Celestial and Material Nexuses alignments, so that they can channel their most powerful spells. Not to mention, the use of conjuration as a means for teleportation and such, has produced many results some would deem interesting, at the very least. The mana, the material from which the threads of the Weave are carefully woven are scarce, and since there is peace, the cycle of replenishment from the Celestial planes has halted.",
						"Where does this leave us? Kyrmorians have practiced magic for ages, honing the Art to such lengths that even mages are able to perform feats only powerful clerics could, in the past. But, with the limitations placed upon us for the last 300 years, the process has been a slow, yet dedicated one. We cannot say what the future holds, but one thing is certain. Masters of Arcana still walk and scry the lands, their arsenal full of powerful tricks and enchantments, racing for the one goal: the one True Magic, and the restoration of the Nexus of Arcana.",
						"This document includes some interesting creations that the writer deems worthy of mention, as well as cataloguing training techniques for the initiated to the Art. To the reader, the writer wishes a good read and extends but a few warnings: do not attempt to impersonate deities, do not attempt teleportation or planar magic without meticulous calculations, and should you come across a Ley Line or a Nexus, do not wish for anything. Seriously.",

								"When the dark god Xyndaran was imprisoned, he scattered pages of his Black Gospel all over the material plane, as a final act of defiance against his fellow deities. And, as is natural, mortal curiosity drove destiny to unfold.",
								"About 6400 years before the Sundering, during what was called the Age of Great Magic, many practitioners of Old Magic, Gramarye, started uncovering pages of the gospel and stuyding its more structured and robust approach towards the manipulation of mana. It was around this time that what would be latter known as \"the Art\" took a proper form, as well as the division of spellcrafting into schools of magic. Yet, many abused this newfound power, falling to the dark temptations hidden in the gospel's pages. This caused Temporus, the dragon god of magic and time to instruct the dragons of the material plane to teach mortals how to manipulate the Weave ethically, without needing to delve into the profane practices of Xyndaran's residual malice.",
								"At some point during this era, two major factions opposed each other: those who abused the Weave, harnessing the dark magics of the gospel, and the disciplines of the dragons, who sought balance. The rising tensions culminated in an epic clash that saw the dark mages defeated, and the emergences of those taught by the great wyrms as the first archmages of history.",
								"However, there is no such thing as no dark spot in history, and while the archmages were celebrating their victory and preparing the world for a new era, others plotted in the shadows. Thendrix Hollow, one of the first archmages, grew curious and greedy, seeking out the secrets of the Black Gospel. He believed that the dragons presented only one side of the coin, and wished to unravel the greater truths of magic. Students gathered around him, as well as other ambitious figures, creating the faction that would survive history to this very day: the Apostles of the Gospel."

Consuming the Nexus of Arcana, and corrupting the Weave itself, he used his power to force the gods into the material plane. Rare records of this event, known as the Sundering, tell of how the stars in the sky fell and blinked out of existence one after the other, as the Dreadlord waged his vengeful war against he makers of the cosmos, now restrained in physical forms and unable to access their true powers. The Dreadlord was eventually defeated, but the aftermath of his actions left magic broken, wild and unpredictable."

										"Little is known about the origin of the apostles. Scarce references spread around Kyrmoria, date the cult's beginning some centuries before the Dragon Wars, in the form of a small sect of worshippers to some cryptic deity. In later times there have been incidents of their appearance circling grand events of theurgy, spread among numerous religious calendars, or in ancient long lost tombs searching maniacally. As a general rule, a mixture of fact and fiction seems to envelop the history of the organization as well as its grim origins.",
										"In the modern age, the Apostles of the Gospel remain active throughout Kyrmoria. There is no clear hierarchy, according to their ancient edict, and members aren't forced to reveal anything more than what is revealed to them. Thusly, there exists no formal base of operation, and members of the faction oftent act independently according to their own wishes and desires. No loyalty is required among members and, besides three rules called \"The Whispering Triad\", foul play between colleagues is all but uncommon. A volatile environment engulfed in chaos and conspiracy, constituting an enticing opportunity for those accustomed to such living, many members of the organization are trained in the ways of the rogue or the blackguard, as well as practice the arcane through wizardry or manipulation of the Song of Origin, like bards.",
										"The apostles' dogma is centered on the delusional belief of the world coming to a rebirth, which is viewed upon as their sacred duty to herald. As such, there is ever if any who would welcome a known apostle into any peaceful meet, despite the ironic fact that many within the organization possess extensive knowledge of vast and forgotten secrets, due to their ancient beginnings. Followers of the dogma are welcomed into the apostles with but a simple offering of their conviction, usually in the form of some ruinous secret, be it their own, or someone's who stands in opposition of the dogma (usually a known preacher or scholar of fate). Of course, greater gifts such as a stolen relic of arcane or divine nature, or even the indictment of other members are viewed upon with impressed appreciation.",

While most of the members of the faction possess aspirations that frequently conflict between even the more prominent members of their sect, resulting usually in the abhorrent end of one or both, any believer of the dogma follows the fruitless search for the completion of their dark god's ultimate dream.",
												"While no official hierarchy exists, making the apostles nigh impervious to scrutiny under any means, a byproduct of their original creation, not all members are equal. The apostles are, in great irony, almost a perfect aristocracy, as those of greater power, in knowledge or ability, are usually the ones followed more frequently in whatever plots they concoct, many times by those vying for their untimely death, ready to push on the advantage. Thus, while no benefit or influence stems from the titling, many, in part newer apostles, come to bestow senior members with titles often presented in theocratic societies.",

The only who is rumored among members to hold any significant value is of the Cardinal, a post presented in some ancient lore as the scribe of their dark god, imbued with not only his direct influence but with the sacred responsibility of calling the gathering of the pages, on the most sanctified of days, once every winter's solstice, to inspect the authenticity of the gathered texts and congratulate the secret holders, accompanied usually by a myriad of apostle corpses at the breaking of dawn, when new holders are promptly blessed."

Hated by mostly anyone who knows of their existence and rarely if ever tolerated, the apostles ignore the goals of almost anyone other than themselves. While sometimes, under guise of other, an apostle may travel within a party, it is an inevitable fate that in the future to come, his true character will be promptly revealed to be capricious, cruel, and oftentimes insane. Apostles are rarely known to employ mercenaries, mostly those proficient at tracking and killing without notice, as is the usual route taken regarding those poor few who come to acknowledge their existence and show no interest in achieving their enlightened spirit.",
												"One exception to the aforementioned concerns the followers of the Fate Weaver. Eons ago, during the imprisonment of the master that the apostles feverishly seek to release, it was she, that pointed out his ambition and coaxed the other divines into action. Therefore, almost any apostle will seek to defile, destroy and corrupt any follower or religious site of the Fate Weaver, as long as the act does not intervene with their original cause."

He cast 999 of them down in the mortal realm in his final moments, keeping the last and worst one well hidden in the shadowy reaches of his dark domain.

										"When King Yrvain reclaimed the throne of Merinthor two hundred years ago, many of the higher ranking officers advocating for his brother's right to rule deserted the kingdom, in fear for their lives and the inevitable reforms. Most notable among them, was a group of mages operating under House Xessar, conducting research on mana geodes and Ley Lines. These mages traveled through the Emerald Wilds to avoid pursuit, eventually finding shelter in a ruined city from the Second Age atop the mountain peaks that ascend into Death's Reach. Through clever usage of sorcery, they managed to track the system of caverns lying underground, and chose to hide there. To their surprise, they found an immense amount of mana geodes, ripe for mining, beneath the peaks. Commanding magics that shaped the natural environment inside the caves, they set up a settlement, and through research discovered the strong flow of ley lines close to the location of created mana geodes.",
										"Over time, word traveled among circles of mages and warlocks alike, that beneath the deadly cliffs, a new sanctuary for practitioners of the Art was erected, far from watchful eyes and unrestricted by Kyrmorian law. Nowadays, the citadel of Dhen Razheem stands proud inside the caverns of Death's Reach. Two hundred years of constant research and progress have allured many a mage who wishes to pursue spellcraft through unconventional and cryptic means. The citadel hosts a large market with various treasures of arcane nature, often visited by rogue casters in search of illegal materials or forbidden secrets. Dhen Razheem sports great financial strength, as well as security, due to its natural location. Spearheaded by the Cabal, it is a blossoming haven for mercenaries and criminals looking for work or evading judgment. However, the Cabal rules absolute, enforcing their own, unchallenged authority, with an iron fist.",
