								"In the Shadow Realm, the roads and the politics are equally treacherous. Navigating the gray areas of both are The Night Messengers, a loose organization of daring couriers. Comprised of all manner of backgrounds and alignments, the Messengers take one cause as sacred: When they have a contract to deliver a message or package somewhere in the Realms, they fulfill it. Identifiable by their distinctive coats\u2014from which they can summon shadowy mounts that let them traverse the trails left by the mysterious witchlights\u2014Messengers live a life of danger, but it's one that affords them a certain amount of prestige and neutrality even in the coldest of courts.",
								"The cadre of Night Messengers led by the bearfolk ranger Bhorhan Svorsson took a contract to deliver a package from Wormwood to Corremel. The client, a frazzled scholar named Lyrio Felanthos, emphasized repeatedly that the package must only reach his trusted colleague, a scholar of the shadow fey named Alluna. He has already sent ahead word to her about its impending arrival, as he fears this culmination of his life's research has drawn attention from something in the shadows.",
								"Lyrio wasn't wrong. Within a day of giving the parcel to The Night Messengers, he was found dead\u2014poisoned\u2014his study ransacked, and the killer left no trace behind.",
								"His killer was {@creature Erestee Loff|TalesFromTheShadows}, a shadow goblin assassin in the employ of the Court of Night and Magic. The Court had sent her to Wormwood to monitor Lyrio, discover the extent of his research into the legendary, long-vanished artifact known as the {@item Shadow Grimoire|TalesFromTheShadows}, and bring back his findings.",
								"During her investigation, Erestee learned that Lyrio believed the {@i Shadow Grimoire} was an intelligent tome driven to push its owner to become a master of shadow magic. Realizing the extent of Lyrio's work, Erestee's plans changed. Although she was working as a shadow enforcer, Erestee had discovered recently that she had a talent for magic and wished to gain greater mastery of it herself. So, instead of reporting back to the Court or taking Lyrio with her, she decided to kill him and follow the trail of his research herself. Only she waited one day too long; after she murdered him, she couldn't find any notes about the {@i Shadow Grimoire} anywhere, just an urgent note he'd written to himself to summon a Night Messenger.",
								"Erestee inquired around Wormwood and learned that a group of Night Messengers had left town heading south, into the Sable Forest. She followed but found little evidence of their passing on the main road. By luck, however, Erestee {@i did} find a raiding party of {@creature Ghoul||ghouls} of the Twilight Empire ({@book Book of Ebon Tides|BookOfEbonTides|7|Twilight Empire}) returning (largely empty-handed) from an unsuccessful city raid. Erestee leveraged her Court connections with the company's darakhul captains to persuade them to hunt down The Night Messengers on her behalf, convincing them that The Night Messengers were smuggling a number of refugees that the Court wanted captured or terminated. In return, the ghouls would be allowed to take these \"refugees\" back to the Twilight Empire as plunder.",
								"With the help of the ghoul raiders, Erestee found the Messengers' trail, and she and a contingent of ghouls caught up with their quarry in the Sable Forest. Upon seeing the raiders approach, the four Messengers scattered to try and split the enemy's forces in an effort to give Bhorhan, who carried the package, the opening he'd need to press on for Corremel. Erestee, however, seized on the opportunity of Bhorhan being alone, jumping onto his back and stabbing him with a poisoned blade. But she underestimated the hardy bearfolk, and the ranger fought back fiercely, forcing her to retreat.",
								"In the encounter with the Messengers, the ghoul party lost both its darakhul captains, leaving it a rudderless horde of hungry undead chasing after the nearest promise of food: the Messengers.",
								"After Erestee's attack on Bhorhan, the bearfolk ranger stumbled deeper into the woods to hide and recover, but some ghouls caught his scent and followed to make a meal of him....",

From there, they get drawn into the clash between the ghouls and The Night Messengers.",
										"If the PCs are in Midgard (or whatever world your PCs call home), they may have gotten lost in a shadowy forest where the boundary between the prime material plane and the Shadow Realm is thin. Perhaps the insatiable hunger of the ghouls draws their quarry across the veil, or Bhorhan's urgent need for aid drags our unsuspecting heroes into the fray."

He sits contentedly for some time and then slumps over slightly, dead, but with a comfortable smile on his face. He has seen the enemy he feared and dreamed of, slain by heroic strangers, and is happy to finally be at peace.",

So, too, have the normal sounds one would expect to find in a wood returned, which comes as a bit of a shock after all the time spent in the eerie, deadening silence."

Their mage, Risa d'Ruvek (N shadow fey {@creature mage}), discovered, after years of research, a way to restore their founder to flesh using an arcane ritual requiring a basilisk's gullet. Having recently reclaimed the statue, the Sodality had tasked one of their best to oversee the restoration, as it was their belief that only the worthy may fulfill such a holy quest. While this brother was successful at procuring the basilisks and hiding them away, he was found to be unworthy, as the basilisks ultimately turned him into a statue as well.",

They will be rewarded for slaying the basilisks even if deemed unworthy.",

The Dusk Queen used her mirror with rapidly growing paranoia and zeal, wreaking havoc and death throughout the land. The Sun King found it more and more difficult to overlook the queen's escalating acts of evil and violence. When he learned the Dusk Queen was secretly plotting to invade his homeland, the Sun King knew he had to act.",
