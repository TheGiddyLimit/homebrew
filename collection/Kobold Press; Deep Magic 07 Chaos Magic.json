						"The ability to channel and manipulate raw arcane power belongs to sorcerers alone\u2014at least, that's what the mainstream schools of magic would have you believe. But a handful of wizards and bards have mastered something similar, called chaos magic. Dominating the chaotic energy of change itself leads a spellcaster along a narrow path that circles a pit of madness. Those who cling tenaciously to the path and avoid slipping into that roiling pit are rewarded with exceptional gifts. These practitioners, known as chaos mages (wizards) or luck stealers (bards), learn to alter reality through strength of will alone.",
