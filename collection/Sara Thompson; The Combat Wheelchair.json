						"Made with the adventurer in mind, the Combat Wheelchair is supportive and intuitive, designed for both daily activity and the pressures of combat during one's adventures. It can be specifically tailored to its user with a variety of intuitive upgrades, designed and created by first-rate artificers and their disabled consultants to ensure high-grade comfort and excellent efficiency. Not only this, the wheelchair prides itself as being sleek, fashionable, and durable at a price affordable for the discerning mobility user.",
						"Taking its design from the chair used in sports such as wheelchair basketball and rugby, the Combat Wheelchair can withstand high impact and even work as a weapon in itself, providing the user with a means of both defence and attack.",

However, this chair only has so many Features because it is designed to enable a disabled party member to do exactly what the abled members of the party can do.",
								"{@b \"But it can float up and down stairs! Isn't that unfair?\"} No, unless you plan on making all the able bodied characters at level 1 also remain on ground floors only and never go up and down stairs and into dungeons. If you were planning on doing that then that's fair. Wait. What? What do you mean I sound ridiculous, hm?",
								"{@b \"But it can be used as a weapon! Isn't that unfair?\"} No, unless you plan on taking away every player's weapon. If you were planning on doing that then that's fair. What do you mean that sounds silly? Additionally, this chair uses the Dungeons & Dragons established rulings that it cannot be used to make Extra Attacks until level 5.",
								"{@b \"But this chair has equipment that comes with it!\"} Yes, in much the same way a sword comes with a sheath and belt, a Dungeoneer's Pack comes with ropes and caltrops, or a horse comes with a saddle and bridle, the Combat Wheelchair comes with seatbelts and gloves.",

								"{@b \"Why would anyone need a wheelchair? This world has magic!\"} Again, we recommend you read Salvatore's {@i Drizzt} novels. Additionally, healing spells like Restoration and Regeneration are very costly, and what about those of us simply born with our disabilities? You cannot regenerate or restore what was not there to begin with. And some of us? Well, we don't want to be 'fixed'.",
								"{@b This chair was never created to make a disabled character 'better' than an able bodied character. It was made to enable characters with disabilities to go adventuring the same as an able bodied character.}",
								"{@b If you take issue with disabled people celebrating and having fun with the game that they love, then you need to reconsider your stance on disability. Disability is nothing to be ashamed about.}",

								"If you plan on trying to carry the Combat Wheelchair by yourself once it has been folded up, remember that it can be quite a challenge to do so, especially over long distances. Your carrying capacity is your Strength score multiplied by 15, the result being how much you can carry in pounds (lbs). As this wheelchair doesn't rely on a motor but a mix of manual and a small magically imbued set of Beacon Stones (which are roughly the size and weight of a pebble), it is more lightweight than other wheelchairs available throughout the Realms weighing only 25 pounds (lbs).",
								"However, it is important to remember that 25 pounds (lbs) is the {@b base weight} for the chair. As you add Upgrades, your chair will begin to weigh more and become more cumbersome. Your DM may ask that you keep track of your wheelchair's weight. The weight for each upgrade is specified in the Upgrades section of this item.",

The first is that you can run your hand or fingers over it to indicate and guide the chair in which direction you want it to go\u2014this use was designed for users who may not have full use of their arms or an illness or disability which means they lack the energy to push the chair themselves. Regardless of whether you push or direct the chair using the stone, the Combat Wheelchair always has a base movement speed of 25 feet.",
