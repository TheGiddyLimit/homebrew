In times of war, goosilisk blood is manufactured into fragile bottles and thrown into enemy lines using slings. Upon impact, the potion shatters, emitting a sudden burst of gaseous liquid that, if inhaled, mimics the creature's goosifying properties for a short time. While these effects are only temporary, a goose-vial assault can quickly turn the tide of a close battle, sowing confusion and panic amidst soldiers as their regiments transform into squawking, flustered water fowl."
