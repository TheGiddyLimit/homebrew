The Sync'd spends an action of the appropriate type to have the Automaton take that same action (Autonomous Engineers have exceptions to this rule).

They function just like spells and follow all the rules for spells. For example, an infusion can be dispelled, it will not function in an antimagic area, and an artificer must make a Concentration check if injured while attempting to imbue/place an infusion (failure means the infusion is stopped and must be restarted).",
				"As an Artificer, you use Schemas (see below) in combination with your known Infusion Formulae (See Below) from the list formulae you have learned/created/or discovered. Like spell casters, you automatically gain Infusions as you progress. Like Wizards, it is possible for you to learn new infusions and Schemas. These might include ancient infusions you find in the ruins of Xen'drik or secret infusions known only to the members of certain guilds or organizations.",

A schema differs from a spell in that a schema doesn't pull the magic to create the effect - it the understanding needed to infuse the power of that Schema into an item but not to cast the spell itself. Therefore, you cannot cast the spell directly (but are able to create scrolls or wands with the spell's ability imbued within it). Some Schema's knowledge also allows you to research and create Formulae that have the prerequisite spell as a requirement for creation.",
						"As with Infusions, schemas are not the same as a warlock's, a cleric, sorcerer or even a wizard's magic - being neither arcane or divine in nature, but are those spell's underlying pattern, the most basic form of the magic's effect. Any other class would not be able to pick up the book and reverse engineer the spell schema into a workable spell. (DM's Fiat obviously overrides that).",
						"You can also copy the addition spells into your schema book by examining a scroll, a spell book, schema book (This does not use up the book). Artificer's automatically know how to use any of their known spells as schemas and does not need to keep schema of the spell in their schema book -- for spells gained from multi-classing, however, this does not go both ways. They may not use Spell Schema's they've learned as spells and cast them through the use of spell slots.",
						"Additionally, Whenever another creature casts a spell (and is within your schema level range), as a reaction you can make an Arcane (Intelligence) check against the caster's spell DC. If successful you remember the details of the spell and can add it to your schema book. You can only hold onto one spell until you've copied it, and you are must maintain concentration to hold the spell schema in memory until the copying is completed. Copying Schemas costs 20gp and 1 hour per spell slot (though some infusions may reduce that time).",
