This damage cannot be reduced by any means.",

						"When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd or higher, you may store any spell of a level up to the same level of spell slot used, and the spell functions as if it was being cast from the same level spell slot (for example, a 5th level spell slot can be used to create a spell-storing item that launches a fireball that deals {@dice 10d6} fire damage).",
						"Higher spell levels are even more dangerous to work with; if you take damage due to suffering a mishap, you take {@dice 2d6} damage per spell level of the spell slot you were attempting to cast from (for example, a failed attempt at using a 3rd level spell slot to imbue a spell-storing item with a fly effect might deal you {@dice 6d6} damage, if the DM doesn't decide on some other consequence).",
						"Additionally, it requires greater effort and concentration to speed up the casting time of this spell when casting it at higher levels. If you choose to expend Hit Dice to reduce this spell's casting time, you must expend Hit Dice equal to the spell's level."
