Their underwater nation is called the Eternal Dominion, and life in the Dominion centers around mindbogglingly gigantic leviathans that sleep on the ocean floor, known as the kar'lassa. These antediluvian beasts have never stirred in their slumber, and the sahuagin build their cities on\u2014and in\u2014their bodies, harvesting their blood and biomatter for food, industry, and magic. Kar'lassa blood has powerful transmutation properties, and careful, ritual consumption of this primal substance, as well as other beings, is what causes sahuagin to mutate, gaining different forms and abilities. For example, the Blood Frenzy trait that sahuagin of the Monster Manual possess is a common mutation for sahuagin in the military, but not every sahuagin is bestowed this power.",
					"The Eternal Dominion interacts peacefully with coastal settlements along the southern shores of Khorvaire and the port city of Stormreach on Xen'drik's coast, so long as their borders are respected. The sahuagin are currently at war with the elves of Aerenal, especially the underwater territories of the Valraean Protectorate that the elves seized from the Dominion. For more information about the Eternal Dominion, the Valraean Protectorate, and the eldritch kar'lassa, look no further than Keith Baker's Exploring Eberron.",
					"Though sahuagin are said to worship the Devourer of the Dark Six, known to them as Sha'argon, they have several peaceful treaties with nations and even House Lyrandar. Sahuagin often act as guides for sailing vessels and House Lyrandar wind galleons as they make their way across the surface of the Thunder Sea, typically sailing to and from the city of Stormreach.",
					"Although sahuagin can breathe air for a short time, they are ultimately dependent on salt water to live. Due to this, most sahuagin adventurers limit themselves to underwater questing, or stick close to coastal lands. Sahuagin adventurers that find themselves needing to walk dry land for longer periods seek out magical oceanic wrap clothing that will sustain them indefinitely."

				"You reach out and mentally analyze the magical animating force of a warforged or construct you can see within range and then, with an effort of will, catastrophically disrupt it. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes {@damage 11d8} force damage, or half as much damage on a successful save. The damage can't reduce the target's hit points below 1. If the target fails the saving throw, its hit point maximum is reduced for 1 hour by an amount equal to the force damage it took. Any effect that removes a curse allows the warforged or construct's hit point maximum to return to normal before that time passes. This spell has no effect on any other type of creature."
