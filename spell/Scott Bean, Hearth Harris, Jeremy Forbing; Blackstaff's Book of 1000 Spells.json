								"In a just universe, the first Blackstaff would write this prolegomenon himself. Yet the gods' fix most of their attentions on the firmament of creation. The stars remain in their courses, and the greater part of worldly justice is a task they leave to us. So, to my sorrow, composing this tome's introduction falls to me.",
								"Khelben Arunsun, better known as the first Blackstaff of Waterdeep, was an archmage unlike any other in the annals of the Realms. In terms of his complex service to the city he loved, his importance to its security and politics without any desire for worldly rulership, and his astonishing preparations to pass on his legacy, the man stands unique.",
								"He was also a good friend. The enormity of his loss cannot yet be reckoned in words.",
								"Of further note is the depth of the Blackstaff's commitment to advancing the practice of the Art, which he pursued by some novel methods. One example is the tome ye now bear in hand.",
								"Khelben allowed copies of some of his most expansive compilations to circulate widely among other mages, which was rare enough. Yet each copy also bore a subtle and robust enchantment. Knowing well the tendency of mages to scrawl notes around the margins of their grimoires, by his magic he caused any note written in one copy of this spellbook to be copied into all the others (though only visible by further Art) and to appear, translated, in the native language of any reader.",
								"\"By this dweomer\u2014 so carefully laid I did not detect it for years\u2014he thus surveyed the age's great magical minds, sometimes in conversation with one another. It opened a window into the thinking of foes and allies alike, revealing new perspectives he often used in teaching of his apprentices. For those who uncover these hidden observations (which few do without a hint or two), these remarks carry great interest.",
								"The incomparable Lady Laeral, Open Lord of Waterdeep, has consulted with me in choosing one of these volumes to be copied in much greater numbers and presented as a comprehensive canon of spells for students of the Art. Serving the study of spellcasting is not our sole motive in this. We see having this grimoire used and treasured by scores of mages, in this world and others beyond, as a fitting tribute to the Blackstaff, a living legacy of the work he began.",
								"So take heed, ye students of magic: the present volume contains a prodigious collection of arcana, including all the hundreds of spells previously presented in my own recent Guide to Magic, along with twice so many new ones. Also included are notes left by some of the most powerful bearers of their own copies of this tome, from rulers of great city-states and planar travellers of great fame to loathesome lich-lords and even lowly sages of Shadowdale...",
								"Have a care in consulting this grimoire. Not every spell here will suit ye in thy adventures. Wise mentors will pick and choose which should be available to younger mages. Some have been thoroughly researched and tested, whereas others are experimental and may require modification. It will suit ye well to be cautious in deciding which of these dweomers to use.",
								"As a final warning, Khelben's enchantment still holds, so be very mindful of what private thoughts ye record in a personal copy; it is unlikely they will remain private for long!"

So feel free to have your character speak of {@spell raise dead} as a spell of 5th level, or suggest an ally cast {@spell magic missile} as a higher-level spell; these terms are part of how experts on magic use discuss the Art of spellcasting."

								"All spell effects draw upon the magical energies which underlie the substance of reality itself. The raw stuff of magic, however, is not sufficient to enable actual spellcasting. By means of incantation, precise gestures, and the right materials, adepts access an existing metaphysical structure, which conveys eldritch energies in response to proper casting.",
								"The mages of Abeir-Toril (the world known to some as \"the Forgotten Realms\") name that structure as the Weave. In other planes, that title is seldom used (though I hear more mages from elsewhere employing it of late, likely due to the wide distribution Faerûnian arcane literature). Yet in every place where spellcasting functions in a way we would recognize, some similar structure exists.",
								"In many worlds, the structure of magic is strongly identified with lines of power crossing the land. In others, it is directly connected with celestial objects (in one such world, a trio of moons fuels arcane casting, while divine casters tap into the favor of their gods via the stars). Rumors speak of worlds where magic is directly tied to the cycle of life itself, and of places where the mere act of casting a spell may have destructive effects, either on the nearby landscape or on the user's own mind.",
								"The magical structures of different worlds disperse ambient energies at varying levels. In the world of Eberron, magic seems to suffuse every object. The world's underlying web of eldritch power is accessed by an unusally large portion of the mortal population (despite having many more spellcasters, however, the number of mages capable of casting spells higher than 3rd-level is very low). Eberron's oldest myths speak of three \"Progenitor Dragons,\" one of whom was slain and then became a great ring which can be seen in the sky, or possibly became the local expanse of the Astral Plane (the legends are contradictory and unclear). It may be the remaining energies of this 'dragon,' Siberys, which radiate magic throughout Eberron and all its adjoining planes.",
								"Thankfully, such magical structures are similar enough in different planes (perhaps by divine design?) that most of the same spellcasting techniques seem to function across the known multiverse. Thus, mages in many worlds cast the spells of my peers from the Circle of Eight (including such well-known names as Bigby, Tenser, Otiluke, and Drawmij), while over the years, Elminster and I have both excersized some degree of our normal power in the domain of Barovia.",
								"This remains true in the Inner and Outer planes as well. In Outer Planes such as Mechanus, Limbo, the NIne Hells, or the Seaven Hevens, these structures were clearly created by deities for their own use and that of their servants. In the Inner Planes, such as the Astral Plane, the Elemental Planes, and the Feywild, these structures seem to have emerged spontaneously, and they are less rigid and efficient, diffusing magical energies everywhere.",
								"Whether a spell is \"arcane\" or \"divine,\" the caster channels the same ambient magic. In general, the differences are matter of how one begins. To employ a metaphor, there are many ways to build a campfire, one might employ flint and steel, rub sticks together, use an existing torch, pour lamp oil on wood, et cetera. However you start a campfire, once lit, it is still the burning of firewood that provides the desired heat and light",
								"Similarly, however a caster starts the process of gathering magic for their spell, the actual effect is always fueled by the Weave (or the equivalent structure for that plane).",
								"There are many examples. Emotions become the lens by which a bard both perceives the Weave and focuses its power. A burst of the deity's power comes in answer to a divine caster's prayer to begin a spell (diminishing the god's might, but usually in a miniscule way, like a drop from an ocean; the faith of the worshippers can replenish it). This holy spark may come directly, by the sacred covenant of a paladin's oath, or through a druidic connection to the land, it ignites the same drawing of magic from the Weave.",
								"Do not confuse the way deities directly grant their clerics spark of their own power to with the more complicated way an otherworldly patron provides magic for a warlock. A patron negotiates access to the energies of the {@i plane} to which that patron is connected\u2014not the patron itself. A warlock's pact creates a direct conduit to the magical essence of such a plane. The patron is not the source, which is why certain less powerful entities (such as lower-ranking devils) can act as patrons to warlocks whose power may eventually exceed their own. Warlocks who make pacts with minor devils aren't using magic from one particular fiend; they literally wield the power of Hell itself."

For instance, surely he knows that 10th-level spells were once cast in Faerûn? When the ancient archmages of Netheril abused such magic, Mystra, the goddess who is the Weave, cut spells higher than 9th level out of our reality. To this day, no mage, no matter their power, can cast such epic spells."

When you cast this spell, you create a magical trap tied to a surface (such as a table or a section of floor or wall) or an object that can be closed (such as a book, a scroll, or a treasure chest). While casting this spell, you physically trace the area of the surface or the outline of the object to be trapped. If you choose a surface, the area of the surface can be no larger than 20 feet in diameter. If you choose an object, that object must remain in its place; if the object is moved more than 20 feet from where you cast this spell, the spell ends without being triggered.",
				"You decide what triggers the trap when you cast the spell. For fang traps placed on a surface, most typical triggers include touching or standing on the trapped surface, removing another object covering the surface, or approaching within a certain distance of the surface area. For fang traps inscribed within an object, the most common triggers include opening that object, approaching within a certain distance of the object, or manipulating the object in a pre-described way. Once a fang trap is triggered, this spell ends.",
				"You can further refine the trigger so the spell activates only under certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight), creature kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect aberrations or drow), or according to whether or not the creature has immunity to poison damage or the {@condition poisoned} condition. Unlike a glyph of warding, it can't be made to activate on the basis of alignment. You can also set conditions for creatures that don't trigger the fang trap, such as those who say a certain password. You are unable to trigger the fang trap yourself.",
				"Any creature that sees you cast this spell knows the exact area affected, and immediately makes an Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check against your spell save DC, gaining advantage on that check. If the creature succeeds, it also knows what triggers the trap. Otherwise, the fang trap's presence is almost undetectable and requires a successful Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check against your spell save DC to be noticed.",
				"When the fang trap discharges, the object or surface grows huge fangs that immobilize the creature who triggered it. The creature is {@condition restrained} until the beginning of its next turn. At the beginning of its next turn, it must make a Constitution saving throw. If it succeeds, it is no longer {@condition restrained}.
