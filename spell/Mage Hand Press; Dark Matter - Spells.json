The shuttle has room for 9 Medium creatures (a pilot and eight passengers) and can carry up to 2,000 pounds of cargo. The shuttle is enclosed and contains clean, breathable air. It can fly at a speed of 100 feet per round, or up to 1,500 feet per round in a vacuum. The shuttle can carry its passengers into space by flying vertically for 5 minutes on most planets and can enter a planet's atmosphere by descending for the same amount of time. The shuttle has life support and sensors, and is designed to dock with larger ships in the same way a fighter-sized ship can.<br>The shuttle has AC 10 and 8 mega hit points. The spell ends if the shuttle drops to 0 hit points. When the spell ends, the shuttle gently descends to the ground (if there is a substantial planetoid nearby), giving the passengers time to exit."
