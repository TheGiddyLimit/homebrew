				"Striking both palms down upon the ground, a web of flame crackles out around the caster and five streaks of fire rapidly snake along the ground toward up to five enemies the caster can see within a range of 60 feet, leaping towards their target and exploding into a column of flame upon reaching them. Each target must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking {@damage 8d6} fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.",
				"Alternatively, all five streaks of fire can instead converge toward a single target, dealing {@damage 12d6} fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.",
