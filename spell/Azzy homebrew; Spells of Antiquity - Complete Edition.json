The field absorbs the magic of spells cast within this sphere, causing those spells to fail and have no effect.

The field acts on initiative order 20 and can only cast one spell per round, requiring no components. If the spell requires a target, the field will choose the valid target nearest to the center of the energy transformation field. If a linked spell requires {@status Concentration|XPHB} to maintain, the field maintains {@status Concentration|XPHB} for the maximum duration before casting the linked spell again. Spells cast by the field are not absorbed by it.",

A dispel magic spell cast on the field is absorbed by the field unless cast with a 9th-level spell slot, and an antimagic field prevents the energy transformation field from absorbing magical energy while it lasts. If two or more field spells share an overlapping area, each field has an equal chance of absorbing a spell effect in that area. Only a wish or similar spell can destroy the energy transformation field."

Any light source in the area that would normally produce bright light produces dim light instead and all sources of dim light are darkness. In addition, creatures in the area have vulnerability to necrotic damage.",

Any creature that enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 10 feet directly away from the center of the area. If this spell is cast on a creature, that creature is immune to being pushed by this spell",
						"{@b Elemental plane of Earth.} The entire bubble is filled with constantly churning sediment, blinding any creature as long as it remains in the area while also providing total cover. There is no air present in the area, so a creature that needs to breathe must hold its breath or begin to suffocate. In addition, a creature moving through the area must spend 4 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves unless it has a burrowing speed.",
						"{@b Elemental plane of Fire.} The bubble is filled with a sweltering heat. Any creature that enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there; it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take {@damage 1d8} fire damage. Creatures wearing medium or heavy armor, or who are clad in heavy clothing, have disadvantage on the saving throw. Flammable objects in the area that are not being worn or carried ignite.",
						"{@b Elemental plane of Water.} The entire bubble is filled with water drawn from frigid, crushing depths. While in the area, a creature suffers from the normal effects of Frigid Waters (see \"Unusual Environments\" in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide)."
