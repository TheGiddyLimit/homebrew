The width of the outskirts will usually range from 300 to 1500 feet depending on the circumstances. Orientation in the outskirts requires one or several Wisdom (Survival) checks against your spell save DC, even for rangers in their favored terrain. In addition, neither the domain itself nor its outskirts are perceptible from the outside. Through a phenomenon of illusion, they simply appear as the continuity of their surroundings. Within the outskirts, part of the wondrous domain's features may be effective, at the leader's discretion.",

There, it is possible to build gravity-defying buildings, unmelting ice sculptures, eternally flowing fountains, etc. Such feats will still require appropriate skills and a suitable workforce, but the nature of the domain will considerably facilitate them.",

The leader then determines in what circumstances the object may break again. In addition, it is not possible to cast mending twice on the same object or object part. For example, it is possible to mend all four wheels of a cart separately, but not the same wheel twice.",
							"{@bold Turn Back Time.} If you use this option, when you reach 5th level, you can cast another variant of mending. In this variant, the spell has a range of 5 feet and a casting time of 1 action. Its effects are to bring an object back to the state it was in on the previous round, provided that all of its components are within range. Anything that has been swallowed, incorporated, fused, has been used to inflict damage, or is held is unaffected by this spell. For example, if a glass of liquid has been shattered, it is possible to bring it back to its previous condition, along with the liquid it contained, but if its contents have just been drunk, they cannot be brought back.",
