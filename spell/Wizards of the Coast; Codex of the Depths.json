				"This spell causes one Large or larger creature to be reduced in size and pacified for easier handling. The target can attempt a Wisdom saving throw to negate the spell's effect. On a failed save, the target's size is reduced to one-quarter in all dimensions, and its weight is reduced to one-sixteenth of normal. Equipment worn or held by the creature is likewise reduced in size and weight. Any item dropped by the target creature returns to normal size at once.",
				"While so reduced, a creature has its mind and instincts transformed, imposing disadvantage on Strength saving throws, suppressing strong emotions, and putting the creature into a state of complete calm. The creature does not attack or engage in combat unless it is attacked or otherwise provoked, which ends the spell.",
				"If powdered ruby worth at least 200 gp is used as the spell's material component instead of powdered pearl, the duration is doubled and the saving throw is made with disadvantage."
