The recipient must be missing the same limb or body part; this spell doesn't allow you to grant a creature extra body parts, nor does it allow you to graft body parts to places where they aren't supposed to go (i.e., you can't graft an arm to the stump of a leg or coming out the middle of a chest), nor does it allow you to graft body parts onto a recipient that doesn't normally have that part (you can't add wings to a wingless person, for example). The \"donor\" must be no more than one size category smaller or larger than the target. Only one body part may be replaced per casting of the spell.

The quirk may be annoying but doesn't otherwise cause any mechanical penalties to the recipient.",
				"{@b Prosthetics.} You may also cast this spell using an artificial prosthesis made from wood, metal, or other nonliving material. The prosthesis animates and can't be removed without first successfully casting dispel magic on it. It uses the target's Strength and Dexterity scores and must be made for a creature of its size category. The recipient can use the limb as normal. Sensations perceived through the prosthetic are slightly muted, but the recipient isn't at risk of having a quirk."

In this case, each casting of this spell allows you to remove half the water from the container, doubling the concentration of the remaining concentration. This use of the spell leaves no dust behind."
