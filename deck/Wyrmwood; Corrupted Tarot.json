But when the Suit of Wands is corrupted, we're suddenly plunged into a much more difficult world to navigate. Where the traditional Wands marked a difficult path, the Corrupted Wands offer no path at all. This is the suit of fairy tales... old ones. Witches wait to test and deceive. Will-o-wisps tempt us in a thousand directions. The warm fire, once sustaining, is now cold, captivating, and dangerous. In this reversed suit you'll meet languishing kings and lost travelers.

Wealth, comfort, sensuality and building a lasting legacy for ourselves and our families: this is the wisdom that the Pentacles suit has to offer.",

Instead of golden crops, we reap dessicated and rotten fruit. When we can't work together, our monuments crumble and break, along with our very bodies.
