				"Weapon Arts are techniques that characters can use when they are proficient with a weapon. Unless otherwise noted, most Weapon Arts replace an attack or have a passive effect as described. All mundane weapons have between 1-3 Weapon Arts, but magical weapons can have more at the DM's discretion. Other than passive Weapon Arts, by default a character can use Weapon Arts an amount of times equal to their proficiency bonus. Characters who have Martial Weapon Proficiency are able to use their Weapon Arts an amount of times equal to double their proficiency bonus. See the relevant features for more detail. A character cannot use the same Weapon Art twice in one turn. Characters regain all uses of Weapon Arts on a short or long rest. Some Weapon Arts may have further restrictions. Lastly, not all Weapon Arts are effective against all creatures. A Weapon Art that cripples the legs will not work on a creature that has no legs, is incorporeal, or does not rely on their legs."
