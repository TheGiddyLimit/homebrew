While it has no eyes, it seems to be able to see just fine, and if it has you in its sight, you will feel a cold run through your body worse than any blizzard could force upon you. The chest of the beast is a skeletal form with patched up human flesh covering a large amount of it. The skin of it is far more resistance that one would expect as it is incredibly calcified and molded into the bones of the creature. The arms of it are impossibly long, giving it what seems like a 20 foot reach, they are covered with what seems like a cross between wolf fur and hardened bone, and it feels like a solidified knotted fur. The hands and feets of it are completely skeletal, vaguely humanlike hands, with claws at the end of each of the 5 fingers that seen to be near 4 inches long. The legs of the beast seem to be more inline with something like a deer, long and almost graceful in a way, if they weren't riddled with the same grotesque matted fur-flesh as the arms.",
