				"Extremely volatile and terrifyingly dangerous, high explosives combine magic and chemicals in a tightly-sealed container, designed to be directly planted by unlucky operatives. Trigger mechanisms vary, from remote detonation by magical command, to small constructs carrying flames, to simply throwing fireballs at the rough area the explosives were planted.",
				"When detonated, any creature or object within a 25 foot radius of the explosive must make a Dexterity saving throw. A target takes 12d6 force damage plus 6d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. In addition, any other high explosives in the radius are detonated.",
				"Due to the inherent instability of such a potent weapon crammed into a tiny package (often using the least expensive resources available), any heavy impact is often enough to set the explosives off, includes dropping the explosives or hitting them as part of an attack. At the DMs discretion, a d6 should be rolled. On an even result, the explosive does not react to the impact, and may even be rendered useless, if the impact was from an attack. On an odd result, the explosive detonates."
