Historically, the tyrannos proved their worth as rulers by launching extended military campaigns against one another. As the numbers of their subjects dwindled, the efficacy of such campaigns became unsustainable. Traditional tyrannos do little today but rule over the decaying ruins of their once great society while enterprising tyrannos may attempt to start trade with the wider world. Tyrannos are given a wide berth in terms of the functional roles they play in society but most often act as politicians, rulers, and merchants",
