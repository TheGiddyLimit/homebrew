These three cultures prioritized their connections to the natural world, and while later elves created great empires, the lythari were content to remain in nomadic family groups. They are by no means barbaric though. Their crafts and artwork are exquisite, their songs enchantingly beautiful, and they have a command over magic that even high elves acknowledge is impressive. A combination of their robust oral traditions and their isolation from the wars and espionage that takes place between other elven people means they retain lore long since lost everywhere else. They are not a warlike people, however, and while they will fight to defend themselves, they dislike conflict. Many returned to Arvandor and the Feywild during the Faerûnian Crown Wars, but a few can still be found in ancient forests and around major elven settlements."

Lythari, however, have none of the aggressive or violent motives that many werewolves have. Additionally, most lythari are natural therianthropes, meaning they were born to lythari parents and are not \"cursed\", always having been able to transform. Lythari can also increase their numbers with ancient rituals that gift other elves with this transformative ability. While a lythari bite can also pass this on, a bite only works on elves. Other races are entirely unaffected, the only exception being half-elves, who become violently ill as their body rejects the bite. Lythari are very careful not to bite other elves who have not requested it, yet another reason they dislike being involved in broader elven wars."

They generally do not wear the fine fabrics that high elves do, preferring the practicality of soft leathers, their own resilient woven fabrics, or furs. Shoes are only worn in cold weather. Still, lythari enjoy their little luxuries. While accessories are rare, each one is a masterpiece, beautifully hand-carved pieces of bone or stone that would make any merchant drool with greed. The few articles of silk or steel found among lythari possessions are treasured, and even things with little monetary value can become family heirlooms."
