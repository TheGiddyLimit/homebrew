Meals and beds are often doled out to any passing cousin or family friend with the unspoken understanding that the kindness would offered just as readily in reverse.

Outside of their familial communities this behavior can often lead to contention with races and cultures that do not share their symbiotic nature.",

In time, some within the courts grew envious of them and set about destroying their union.",

At last, a conniving courtesan of the Seelie halls tricked one of the young lovers into believing she was his paramour and in grave danger. Upon her supposed rescue the two embraced, and the discovery of them brought forth a rage in his true love that ended in the death of both the duplicitous decoy and her mislead mate.",
							"Heartbroken and afraid, she fled the lands of the Fey and soon birthed a litter of children.",
							"Resolute that they should never know the deceit and darkness of their Fey birthright, she cried out in desperation that this taint of her blood might be removed from the children; that they may truly belong to the new realm in which they were born. For days, weeks, some say even years, she wept in the shade of a sheltering tree and with her dying sob the river of tears she brought forth at last washed away every trace of the Fey magicks within their blood.",

Few return with less than they set off with, and fewer still without finding the maturity they will need in adulthood. A meek few might choose to keep their touring to within a few days ride of home, but the majority take every advantage of this newfound freedom and hurry to the furthest reaches the roads and their crumpled banknotes can take them.",
							"Some portion of this more intrepid bunch will wander much further (or more foolishly) than others, never to return, and while the worst possibilities are often the most likely, Lurikeen families will speak of these lost brothers and sisters as if they're simply off enjoying the wide world and seeking their destiny; as young and as fearless as the day they left, even decades later.",

The wiser and more experienced who find these waylayed wanderers are known to take them under wing, helping them to find their way or leading motley parties towards more promising prospects for the enrichment of them all.",

While this would infuriate many an academic or archivist, to the Merdhrai it is little more than amusement.",
							"Some tell of how they arose fully formed from the sand and sea-foam, others claim they came ashore in longboats or on the backs of whales after a treacherous journey across many oceans. Whatever the truth, they have quickly established themselves along the coast and up the many rivers of the north. Beyond those stony banks and wild evergreen forests the more adventurous of individuals and uncommon of clans have continued to southern shoals and inland kingdoms; walking, riding and rowing ever onward to the next shore, be it over land or water.",
