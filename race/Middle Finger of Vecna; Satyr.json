							"When I awoke, a single beam of light shot past my eyelid and landed, screeching, into my brain. By degrees, I fought past the pain in my cranium to take in my surroundings: a grassy field, far from the tavern in which I last remembered myself. Every detail of the night blurred together in a collage of shapes and colors, devoid of meaning.",
							"\"Rough night, huh?\" a voice behind me beckoned suddenly. A cheerful satyr lounged on a broad stone nearby, his fingers quietly drumming on an idle pan flute in his lap.",

Satyrs are very much at home in inns and taverns, sometimes venturing into humanoid settlements (usually in disguise) purely to sample the atmosphere of a particularly famous common room, gaze upon an extremely beautiful person, or taste an especially rich food."

Enchanted woodlands provide shelter and safety, as well as the companionship of other fey creatures, thus most satyrs make their homes in small, hidden villages. Others are more solitary, retreating to some secluded hermitage to perfect a piece of music or recover after a particularly intense festival."

This makes them easy to identify, for they generally make no attempt to hide these features. A variety of different shades of fur are found among satyrs, with whites and browns being most common. The grooming habits of satyrs are unpredictable, as fey fashions can change rapidly, but the vast majority put at least some effort into looking good at all times.",
