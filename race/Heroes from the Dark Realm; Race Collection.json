					"Thousands of years ago, in a land of mists and dark forests, the noble families of a long-forgotten kingdom sought a way to increase their life span beyond the short years entitled to them by their human heritage. One evening, their elders were approached by a mysterious being known only as \"the Red Witch\"-a scarlet flgure who claimed to hold the key to their dreams. She offered them a powerful and dark blood ritual that would grant them the vitality of an immortal vampire without cursing them with undeath. These human nobles became the first living vampires-blessed with great power gained-the price of their own vitality. Centuries later, the creatures became known by the name of the noble family that first forged the pact; the Vrylokas.",

Soon though, others learned of the dark blood ritual that was the source of their power. An uprising soon followed, and their former kingdom was cast down and lost forever. However, the living vampires thrived, even now, walking high above the world.",
