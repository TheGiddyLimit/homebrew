Reaching upwards, he spoke the words he had memorized a thousand times over, reciting them with untold precision. And then.... The Black Deamon stepped from her place.

Something beyond the answers to the never ending questions laid out before her. Today the visions seemed almost to be asking something of her.",

As she swayed forth over the iridescent vapours, she could almost here a voice, like a mother, or sister, calling out to her by name, offering it's care and concern. The visions softened, and the swirls of cloudlike color receded almost as if pulling away from her. There would be no more prophecy today, no matter what the men asked. And she was glad of it.",

With time, the ancient monks learned to extend this fleeting existence; Using seals empowered through forgotten eastern magics, they bound their astral constructs permanently to the material plane, giving them a solid, humanoid form.

The color of this slime can vary anywhere between bright greens and blues, to dark greys and even blacks, although it seems to remain consistent among members of the same colony. Because their amorphous bodies have no defining internal structure, Myxapia can alter their physical shape on a whim. Some choose to resemble other humanoids they have met, such as elves or humans, while others prefer a less defined shape. It is not uncommon for Myxapia to Mimic the physical features of someone they are speaking to, leading to an eerie duplicity that many find unsettling. More often than not, Myxapia support themselves on a single flowing stalk, rather than two bipedal limbs, and move slowly across the ground in a similar motion to their more primal brethren."

If not for one particular evolution, in fact, the great Qual'ath empires could never have come to be. Perhaps by fate, or perhaps by circumstance alone the ancient ancestors of the Qual'Ath learned to take refuge from the elements within the living bodies of a beast like species known as the Carrak - burrowing beneath their chitinous armor plating, and taking hold of the creatures' simple minds.",

A mature pair, known as a Qual'Carrak, would become a force of reckoning, not just in terms of metal ability, but in terms of physical prowess as well. Never content as they were, however, the empires of the Qual'ath began to seek additional hosts, creatures more suited to the variety of strange worlds they came to inhabit. Today, Qual'Ath tadpoles are known to take host in any number of humanoid species.

The spawning pool and elder brain are cared for by the entire colony as a whole, and after a year, mature tadpoles are implanted into their humanoid hosts in a ceremonial event known as \"the birthing\".",

When the ceremony is complete, host and tadpole have become inseperable, and it is only at this point that a Qual'Ath is considered truly \"born.\" Freshly \"born\" Qual'Ath are already mature adults by the standards of most other societies, having absorbed the appropriate knowledge of their world directly from the elder brain. They enter society immediately, taking roles however they are best suited. As dualistic organisms, Qual'ath grant a sort of immortality to their hosts: using their unique psionic abilities to correct the course of aging and stop normal cell death. Because of this, it is rare for a Qual'Ath to die except by extraordinary means, and when a death does occur, the entire colony mourns the loss together.",

							"But at a point long forgotten, researchers on distant stars challenged this perception in every way. Starving their own tadpoles until the day of their \"birthing,\" this small group, known today as the Illithea, were able to coerce the infantile tadpoles into devouring the brains of unwilling hosts, supplanting the mind of the creature with their own. These Illithid proved to be incredibly powerful, with psionic abilities surpassing even some elder brains. The power came at a cost, of course: without a host brain to draw psionic nutrients from, the Illithid, or Mind Flayers as they have come to be known developed a violent dependance on consuming the brains of others.",
							"Many Elders banded together against the spread of this practice, unnerved and disgusted by the abhorrent parasites it created, but finding willing new creatures to serve as hosts was difficult, and with the everexpanding number of tadpoles being spawned, the horrendous practice soon overtook more traditional values. Today, Illithid represent the largest faction of Qual'ath Societies, and the traditionalists who continue to refuse the practice - known as Thoc-Rah - have been forced into hiding within their own secretive colonies and enclaves.
