							"For those willing to subjugate themselves, he will bestow the gift, but they must be powerful in their own right before earning his trust.",
							"As for the ceremony itself? It was...degrading. I'd rather not revisit that. But we all took part in it. Not really wholesome family activity, but I guess it's something you do when you give yourselves to a dark lord.",

							"They were approached by a mysterious entity known only as the Red Witch a scarlet-clad figure who offered to them a blond-bonding ritual with a dark lord that would grant them the vitality of vampires without subjecting them to the taint of undeath. In later centuries, these creatures became known by the name of the first noble family to forge the pact: the Vrylokas."

							"They have upper canine teeth that sometimes appear slightly more pronounced than the human norm, however unlike true vampires, vrylokas have no fangs.Vrylokas favour clothing that reflects their ancient origin, from layered robes and tall head-dresses to long jackets and trousers, or bodices and skirts.",
