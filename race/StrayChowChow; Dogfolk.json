Dogfolk live in the moment and such history has been lost to time. Dogfolk maintain the diversity of their kin and they credit their successful society to the wide range of skill, talent, and ability that dogfolk possess. If there is a job that needs to be done, there is a dog who can do it. They form strong pack bonds, often among family but dogs often care not of their pack's heritage and many choose their pack among other dogfolk or even other races.",

Choose the category you feel best represents your individual dogfolk's heritage or strengths.",
							"Don't forget, you can use Tasha's Cauldron of Everything to customize your origin to suit your breed better by applying the Ability Score Increases to different ability scores.
