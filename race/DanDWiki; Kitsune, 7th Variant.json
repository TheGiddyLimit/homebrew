					"Kitsune are a type of fey that are far and few between. Delighting in all sorts of trickery, mischief, and general nosiness, those who know of the Kitsune regard them as sometimes annoying, but harmless. Despite an irrepressible penchant for deception, Kitsune prize loyalty and make true companions. Although almost universally good, there are the rare few who follow a path of evil, commonly known as Nogitsune or \"Field foxes\" as opposed to Zenko or \"Good foxes\". Most Kitsune are fascinated with the adventurers they meet, often joining them in their travels to try and satisfy their inquisitive nature. Because of this spirit of curiosity, they are wonderfully suited to the adventuring life.",

Willing to giving over their true name is a symbol of absolute trust. Their second name is a poetic or literal name that describes one of their traits, professions, or simply a cultural name that the kitsune found amusing. Although it's not unheard of to change their name, they tend to keep the first name they choose."

							"Kitsune have two forms. The first is their true form, which is in the shape of a fox. Unlike a normal fox, kitsune may possess multiple tails depending on their age and power. Kitsune are noted for having as many as nine tails. New tails will spontaneously appear as they age and gain more power. Once they reached either the pinnacle of their power or seven hundred years in age, they will grow their ninth and final tail. Their fur will turn white, silver or gold if they are a Zenko or black if they are Nogitsune. Most kitsune obtain their second form upon reaching 50-100 years of age. This form is human in appearance with a narrow face with close-set eyes, thin eyebrows, high cheekbones, and softly glowing amber, golden, or blue eyes. Their hair retains the same color as their fur. In human form they have the ears and tail(s) of a fox, they can choose to hide the ears and tail if they wish. A young or undisciplined kitsune may have difficulties hiding their appearance when in human form. In some rare cases, their are individuals who can see through their disguise merely by perceiving them. Shadows may also reveal their true nature. Regardless of the form, most kitsune carry a signature fox mask with them, either on their person or worn. This mask they are born with, and it grows with them; it is an extension of their very soul."

							"It is a widely known fact that the Kitsune, or fox people, were powerful beings. Rumors of their immense power often fueled sensations of greed to try and harness that power for themselves. As such, the Kitsune had once been severely wiped out via the method of severing their tails. In much of the Kitsune remaining, a deep seeded grudge still often remains toward other races due to that fact. The Kitsune were creations of Inari, who, when this rooted hatred arose, a variant of Inari's original conception of fox spirits turned into two separate subspecies: The Zenko and the Nogitsune. The Nogitsune are known for being evil,feeding into self entitlement and hatred toward other races, turning malicious and now often feared by the masses. Meanwhile, the Zenko take on much more of Inari's intent of creation, being kindhearted and gentle souls who go out of their way to help others. Both of them pay little and no attention to the other most of the time."

As far as societies among the Kitsune are concerned, they often don't live too different lives from other humanoid races. they can be located in a variety of locations and climates, which as such offers variants in the thickness of one's fur, and so forth."
