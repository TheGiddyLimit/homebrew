							"The identifiable features are mouse-like ears hidden within the hair, covering where ears would sit on any other humanoid species. Ears of miceling are better built for listening and identifying sound, thanks to a vastly greater range of motion than standard human ears. Thanks to this, miceling can perceive their surroundings with their hearing only if necessary. Eyes of miceling are typically completely black, beady and reflective, often reflecting a specific colour. giving the eyes more depth \u2014 with these eyes comes much better eyesight in darkness.",
							"Miceling also bare tails, albeit more varied in form that their muroid counterparts. Some have more standard, mouse-like tails while the majority have a slight layer of fur. Tails vary depending on where a miceling was born and who from. Similarly, the soles of miceling feet are also covered in a fine layer of fur as well as having pawpads, allowing them to move quieter than most.",
							"Miceling have slimmer statures, and have a harder time packing on muscle than other species. Speed is something miceling essential, as they often have to evade bigger creatures and escape. Therefore, what muscle they can get is often in their legs and core, allowing them to run faster and with more confidence."

							"Miceling are vegetarian creatures, due to the inability for their digestive system to process meat. Therefore, many miceling live in forests and other areas where natural, plant-based food is plentiful.",
							"Keeping to themselves even within their own community, miceling are a relatively uncommon people in most modern societies, with only a few deciding to integrate with the rest of the world and their towns and cities. Rural miceling live within spiral homes made of twine, wood and soft materials, constructed in fields or forests. When left without the luxury of a home, miceling dig small burrows into soil or find somewhere small and dry where they can curl up, usually with a second escape route.",
							"Miceling share a root language called Miceri that comes naturally to them thanks to bearing ears more suited to hearing the squeaks and higher pitched sounds of Miceri that others cannot. It contains a lot of clicking noises, high pitched squeaks outside of the range of some creatures' hearing, and has a soothing rhythm when spoken. As more miceling spend time with other humans, some have begun to develop a dialect that others without their hearing can learn and be proficient in, currently known as Miceri-Mou. Thanks to also being part-human, miceling are able to speak Common and other languages like it."
