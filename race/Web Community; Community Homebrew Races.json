Thus, the fey'ri were born - devilish in their nature and strength, and yet - as intelligent and swift as their elven parents. When this treachery was discovered, the House was renamed Daemonfey and deemed enemies to all elven kingdoms. A war followed.

The treachery was discovered and the House members were either killed, imprisoned or scattered.",

They mostly resemble elves in their features, yet they have something in them, resembling there devilish bloodline - barbed tails, fangs, forked tongues, horns or any combination of them.

Of course, this made them prideful, looking negatively on outsiders and even other elves. Though they had respect towards intelligence, strength and flexible morals. Today, this fey'ri are either in hiding or prison, having a grudge on the remaining elven Houses and are planning to overthrow those, who they deem traitors; or, maybe, escaping the claws of death, some of them reestablished their values and are now on a quest for redemption?",
							"There are other fey'ri, though - the younger ones, that were born after the Seven Citadels' War. Because even once tainted by the fiendish blood, there's always a chance to give birth to a fey'ri. Some elven societies, being afraid of the cursed bloodline, shun and even kill these children. Others raise them as normal children, never even mentioning that they are \"different\". Being quite nimble from childhood and talented in magics, fey'ri often became Warriors, Rogues or practitioners of the Bladesong. These fey'ri, though still concealing their true form outside of their homeland, tend to value life the same way as their elven brethren, even though they are still trying to experience life to its fullest, because of the chaotic nature that their blood has in it."
