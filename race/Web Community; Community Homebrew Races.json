Resembling elves in their features, yet having something from their devilish blood - barbed tails, fangs, forked tongues, horns or any combination of them. Some even have multiple limbs or bat-like wings. Their skin and hair color may vary from pale white to bright red. And yet - all of them are naturally born with the ability to hide these signs of corruption and appear as normal elves."

							"Five centuries ago, a powerful House of high elves decided that they needed more, that the elven kind should rule not only the forests but every inch of land. Of course - with them as their leaders. Only a few of elven archivists remember the name of this House before its corruption and fall, but every humanoid knows of the Daemonfey. Seeking power, this house incorporated into their ranks fiends and demons, interbreeding with them to give life to a new, more powerful elven bloodline. Thus, the fey'ri were born - devilish in their nature and strength, and yet - as intelligent and swift as their elven parents. When this treachery was discovered, the House was renamed Daemonfey and deemed enemies to all elven kingdoms. A war followed. The Daemonfey armies, although empowered by lesser demons and fey'ri, were defeated. Most of them were killed in the conflict, sealed in prisons - only some have escaped.",
							"The elven kind was victorious... But not for long. A fiends corruption always finds a way out, and those, who were tainted by it during the war, gave birth to new fey'ri. Some elves shunned or even killed such children (even with their parents), being afraid of what could become of them. Others raised them as their own, teaching them the way of the elves. And some newly born were kidnapped by those surviving after the war fey'ri, so that they would be raised in hate to the elven kind. Will the remaining forces of the Daemonfey rise from the shadows and try to conquer that, which they deem as their own? Or will this race find a new path for itself, not dictated by their heritage, nor the public's fear?"

That is why they are gathering troops, kidnapping newly born fey'ri and seeking power - to fulfil their role!",
							"Those fey'ri, who were born not so long ago, have a different view on life: they see themselves as a part of the elven kin - different, maybe even corrupted (if they were shunned by those around them), but still elven. Being swift and intelligent from their birth, and yearning for action, fey'ri often become warriors, rogues or practitioners of the bladesong. But, instead of sharpening their skills at home, their desire for freedom stirs them to the open road.",
							"Just as elves, fey'ri are slow to make friends - sometimes, because they believe others to be insignificant, other times - because they don't trust anybody but themselves. What they do trust, are actions: demonstrations of power, intelligence and quick wit. After some time, they may start to trust those, who they call comrades. But it is very rare for a fey'ri to show their true form to those, who aren't also fey'ri or those, who they consider as their family.",

Others raise them as normal children, never even mentioning that they are \"different\". Being quite nimble from childhood and talented in magics, fey'ri often became Warriors, Rogues or practitioners of the Bladesong.
