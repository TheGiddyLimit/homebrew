His horselike body- for the centaurs only closely resembled horses, being actually smaller and stockier- was as black as his hair, and he had three white feet, a pattern Kellen had not seen in any other centaur.}",

In either case, centaur hold loyalty to the community as high in their esteem and will certainly fight to preserve the safety of their herd, whether that herd is the tribe, the village, or a company of adventurers.",
