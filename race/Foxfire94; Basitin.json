					"The Basitin encompass two separate cultures, both of which live on the Basidian Islands. Living on the Eastern Isles are the Eastern Basitin, the more technologically advanced of both cultures, they rely on ideals of military discipline and obedience to their superiors. Details about the Western Basitin living on the Western Isles are scarce but it seems they still still live with a tribal like culture. The two races are similar and are biologically the same species, all being Basitin, but they appear to rarely interact mainly due to the East seemingly seeing the West as intellectually inferior and the West being hostile of any outsiders in their territory.",
					"Most Basitin look like one another, bearing shades of gray or taupe colored fur and hair, with some rare cases of black fur only ever seen amongst the Western variety of Basitin. Basitin are an anthropomorphic race that features many similarities to feline and lagomorph (Rabbit) characteristics.",
					"The Basitin have an impressive immune system and very resilient bodies. They are able to withstand most poisons and diseases. Basitins are also naturally unable to use magic. When trying to use magic, they will be mentally damaged and this can affect their brain to the point of being unable to speak normally."
