All koradi have various plant-like markings or growths over their bodies \u2014 sometimes symmetrical and sometimes not. These markings help the koradi blend in with the local lands and are used by outsiders to further differentiate them from one another.

Koradi will usually stay away from half-orcs and dwarves, and will keep a close eye on any humans they encounter. But a koradi will be quick to trust a gnome or an elf. Regardless of race however, a koradi holds a creature's respect towards nature (or lack thereof) above all else.
