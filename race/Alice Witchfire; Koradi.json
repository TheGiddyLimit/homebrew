These markings help the koradi blend in with the local lands and are used by outsiders to further differentiate them from one another.

Koradi will usually stay away from half-orcs and dwarves, and will keep a close eye on any humans they encounter. But a koradi will be quick to trust a gnome or an elf. Regardless of race however, a koradi holds a creature's respect towards nature (or lack thereof) above all else.
