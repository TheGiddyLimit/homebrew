					"Minotaur blooded, or simply called minos, have both human and minotaur blood running through their veins, but are their own separate race. While they do have horns, their faces look human, their skin is hairless, and they are generally attractive. Despite their size, they are mostly peaceful, and prefer a life of farming in closely knit minos communities. Many minos are wary of strangers, as their gregarious nature has often been taken advantage of in the past, yet they usually give strangers the benefit of the doubt. Minos are known for their hospitality, strong sense of honor and dedication, and consider ungratefulness and deceitfulness to be great sins. Despite their hospitality, minos tend to keep their communities as homogeneous as possible, only fully accepting fellow minos or humans with whom they share ethnic characteristics, as well as those who proven themselves to be friends of the minos. They act so out of a pragmatic belief that diversity leads to adversity, and seek to prevent future conflicts this way. Regardless whether this is true or not, their communities are well known for their unity, stability, and productivity, even while those of other people around them rise and fall. Despite this pragmatic outlook, they are well known for their genuine kindness and charity, and they've been known to sell their food at lower prices to those in need. Minos do however mix with other races, usually with those adopted by minos parents, with their children being born as small build minos. It is also not uncommon for a minos husband to have multiple wives, as there are often more minos women than men. Those that decide to adventure, instead of living a life of farming, make use of their greater physical prowess in battle. While minos can be down-to-earth to a fault, they're well known for their genuine kindness and loyalty, and often help those who truly need it. Minos keep domesticated animals, and often ride larger beasts instead of horses; like bears, woolly Rhinoceros, or mammoths.",
					"Minos are also well known for their size, granting them the nickname \"friendly horned giants\". However, should they be pressed, they can quickly prove themselves to be more than capable of defending themselves. They strongly believe in the right of self-defense, and often carry a double crossbow. While they tend towards lawful alignments, they are also highly suspicious of large governments, especially those of humans, and they often strive to decentralize power as much as possible. This is because they strongly believe that power corrupts, especially power granted to those who do not live among the common folk. If a threat does arrive, smaller minos communities often band together to form a united front, but only until the threat has been sufficient dealt with.",

					"Descendants from the monstrous harpies and unfortunate male thylean sirens (see {@i Odyssey of the Dragonlords Player's Guide} page 34), these self proclaimed harpies have carved a place in the world for themselves by allying themselves with humans as scouts and messengers, taking advantage of their flight to fill out niche professions that are harder for humans to perform. While there are male harpies, which is not the case with full blooded harpies, they are not as numerous as female harpies are. Therefor it is common for a male harpy to have multiple spouses, and not uncommon for female harpies to seek out partners among other races, often among humans. The children of a harpy and another race will always be born as harpies. There is a belief among harpies that children born between a harpy and another race will often become more \"domesticated\", while those who aren't are often more \"wild\", which causes some harpies to form closed communities. Like full blooded harpies, their songs can enthrall humanoids and cause them to move towards them, although they also become immobile and unable to take flight while singing. Many believe that this is due to their thylean siren blood, as thylean sirens lose their flight when they sing. Overall, this subspecies of harpies is known for its attractive features and comely nature. However, they are also known to be fierce when insulted or threatened, and their vicious claws make for deadly weapons.",
