					"kwiikwii resemble bipedal owls with no wings and taloned hands. Some suspect they are descendents of the first owlbears, or part of the same experiments that created them. They are short, stocky and share the enhanced musculature of their larger cousins.",

					"Ikwiikwii mate for life as a general rule, and their families rarely exceed four individuals at a time. If a family grows too large, the eldest child is encouraged to leave the nest and start their own family. This moment marks true adulthood in their lives, and their parents may make a great display, showering gifts and well-wishes upon their departing child, or throwing a party attended by friends and even extended family.",
					"Although ikwiikii are typically shy, cautious, and generally slow to trust others, they make steadfast friends and trustworthy allies."
