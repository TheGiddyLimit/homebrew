In folk tales they are often described as fair, but cold and calculated seductors who lure folk with their upper halves to then entrap them with their snake bodies. These antiquated tales stem from a time in which lamia had not integrated themselves with the world at large and fortunately only contain small kernels of truth.",

The lamia are not only independent, but a head strong and persistent people who know what they want and their natural problem solving abilities aids them in getting it. These traits earned the lamia a reputation of being smart and determined, but also aloof and calculating, which some folk might interpret as a cold disposition.

In the way a lamia expresses themselves, their facial expression and body language communicate in very subtle and unusual ways, which often go unnoticed by other races. Many unfortunate miscommunications resulted from this characteristic, which in caused many blunders in initial meetings between the lamia and the other people of the world. But this does not mean that lamia are entirely stone faced. A lamia will express quite clearly when an emotional threshold is crossed and emotions boil over. For those unfamiliar to lamia, these outbursts of joy or anger can come unexpectedly and might be misinterpreted as sudden and out of nowhere.",
