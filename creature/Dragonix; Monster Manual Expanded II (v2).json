								"Mephistopheles, the Lord of Cania, is the Archduke of the eighth layer of Hell. Steeped in research and acquisition of knowledge, Mephistopheles has spent countless millennia on the study of arcane magic. The expanse of his research has attracted the attention of other archdukes, most notably Dispater, the lord of the second, who now regularly sends envoys to Cania in case Mephistopheles stumbles upon new knowledge that could be useful to the Lord of Dis. The most prominent research on Mephistopheles' table is that of hellfire magic. While he is the only one who has mastered the use of hellfire magic, Mephistopheles willingly imparts the power to influential people and devoted followers in order to build up and strengthen his cult following.",

But as Asmodeus's foremost wizard of the Nine Hells, Mephistopheles is impatient and unforgiving, and is prone to killing minions and other creatures that he may perceive to be distractions or annoyances to him. Over 9 feet tall with red skin, a muscular body, leathery bat wings, two curved great horns, long black hair, and yellow eyes, Mephistopheles' appearance is that of a traditional devil that mortals perceive. He wears a long, black cape and always carries his ranseur, a vicious three-pronged staff through which he can channel his hellfire magic."

Mephistopheles chooses to keep the entire layer of Cania under freezing temperatures and ice storms to deter unwanted visitors. Anyone wishing to visit Cania will need to sign a written approval from Mephistopheles himself which grants visitors protection from the cold weather, but also makes them subject to Mephistopheles's Word of Injunction. Most visitors are loyal worshipers and powerful wizards who would like to study under Mephistopheles or offer him new knowledge. These unfortunate visitors soon find themselves the fancy of the Lord of Eight and are soon unwillingly bound to a contract and forced to toil in the vast libraries and research laboratories of Cania for all eternity."

This design was not made to punish the dwellers though. Mephistar was brought to lower than freezing temperatures so that the citadel could sustain Mephistopheles' hellfire experiments. Some areas that house the strongest hellfire experiments have already started to melt and are creating icy pools on the floor. While these pools are a trivial matter to its denizens, naïve wanderers and intruders may find themselves frozen in an icy pool of water or dying of hypothermia.",
						"The hallway to Mephistopheles lair is lined with various ports and hidden holes that blast hellfire from time to time. While others may see this as a trap, Mephistopheles only designed this for his amusement. In the middle of his lair, Mephistopheles sits on a slowly melting throne, with a \"moat\" of icy water surrounding the dais. The temperature in the room can change depending on Mephistopheles' whim. Adventurers who wish to defeat the Lord of Eight will have to deal with extreme heat and cold as they battle Mephistopheles. The archduke is an archmage and can emit an aura of hellfire from his body at will. As the true master of hellfire, Mephistopheles can disintegrate opponents through hellfire with nothing but a gaze. While Mephistopheles possesses all of these powers, he perceives combat as trivial and will have his subordinates and the {@creature ice devil||ice devils} he summons to fight for him."
