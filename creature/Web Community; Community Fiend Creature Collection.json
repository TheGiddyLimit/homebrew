But they do still have the ability to talk and state their wishes that a smart creator is better off satisfying not only to gain its favor but to avoid being shredded to bits. While on the prowl the goredrinker's smell is its best weapon, they can pick up the scent of the deceased even to the afterlife. They will go on abandoned battlefields and search for their prey. The overwhelming scent of blood on these sites oftentimes sends them into a frenzy and lets them feast upon any corpse nearby. If someone would be unlucky enough to witness this, that person might just be close enough to end up as the goredrinker's next meal.",
					"Demonic Embrace. The first goredrinker was said to be created under the service of a demonlord trying to confiscate any lost soul for his abyssal army. The knowledge on how to create them has been forbidden by scholars. Some still managed to find out that you need the corpse of a dog, the mane of a manticore, the wings of a still living chimera and some more unknown components. The ritual must then be perfomed in the abyss on contaminated earth. All the components shall be set afire and 3 creatures will be impaled by spikes protruding from the ground. The demon will then be born from the will of the abyss. As its life was given by fire, its only fear is that it will take it away again.",
					"Soul Snatcher. The will to seize souls is inbound to them like an instinct and they will thus do it without question. But it does not see itself as a servant nor anyone else as their master."
