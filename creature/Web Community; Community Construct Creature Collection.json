Animated traps are a masterstroke of object animation, people tend to treat them with caution up until they are disarmed; Once \"disarmed\" an animated trap can catch opponents truely off guard.Used by spellcasters who do not want to be disturbed and have a sick sense of humour; The animated trap is used for self defense and psychological warfare.Tricky Traps. Animated traps left to their own devices will attempt to follow whatever orders they were left last which is usually some combination of: Hide, Ambush and Attack.Animated traps hide themselves after successfully killing, moving away from the bodies as not to indicate their location.Constructed Nature. The trap doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.Monster a Day A194 by 1d6AdventurersTome of Madness Vol1, p21"
