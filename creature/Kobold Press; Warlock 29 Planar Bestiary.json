Other times, they use their own larva as building material, for mature cephaloids are able to control larva at will.

						"In the time before Midgard, there was only the Void\u2014and within that twilight dwelled the ahu-nixta. While mortals use the name to define an ancient race of aberrant, Void-spawned tyrants, it may just as easily represent an ideal or the wellspring of the ahu-nixta's very existence. It is a primordial name, given to these same aberrations by the dragons who coined it from a repeated syllabic phrase pulled from their incessant maddening chatter.",
						"At one time, the ahu-nixta held dominion over many races. Cruel masters, they fed upon the younger entities and stole from them those elements they needed to transcend the Void. They broke the creatures they enslaved\u2014salvaging flesh and bone, dominating thoughts, harvesting fears\u2014and they warped them into vessels for their own designs. But just like those creatures, the encasements built from them proved weak and inefficient, prone to physical aging and damage. No matter how the ahu-nixta manipulated the raw materials, the result was always insufficient. To overcome these flaws, they sought out other raw materials, metals and crystals and other elements, the same the mortal races forged into tools and machinery. Using these new resources, they copied and cobbled, implanted and spliced, creating new forms, each stronger and more lasting.",
						"In the fabled {@i Codex of the Endless Void}, one of the authors theorizes the ahu-nixta as both belonging to the Void and being the physical embodiment of the Void itself. She further claims that the ahu-nixta exist to expand the Void into other realms by building themselves\u2014or rather, {@i itself}\u2014into pieces of the realm. (The text is unclear whether the ahu-nixta are multiple entities or but a single entity spread through multiple forms.) The hive mind then warps the pieces, devouring the realm from the inside out. The theory also attempts to define the Concordant Chronosphere, the prime hive mind intelligence of the ahu-nixta.",

Occasionally these clumps take the form of long, weblike strands and sometimes as blankets of unnaturally sticky or caustic slime. Some believe a hive node's appearance depends on the manner of its creation, but no substantial evidence supports this theory. Nodes range in size from a foot in diameter to the size of an {@creature elephant}, and when ready to burst, they can disgorge from one to over a dozen various ahu-nixta: a large node may be filled with a swarm of {@creature Ahu-Nixta Drudge|ToB2|drudges (see Tome of Beasts 2)} while a smaller node may hold a single large, heavily armored ahu-nixta. It's unknown how long a node can exist in stasis before bursting, but they have been found in ancient and long-abandoned vessels, adrift in the Void, buried in the ruins of sunken cities, and attached to debris, hurling through the planes.",
												"The largest of these nodes is known as Node Prime, a titanic mass of pulsing biomechanical clockwork the size of a small planet. Node Prime serves as something of a homeworld to the ahu-nixta. From Node Prime, the Concordant Chronosphere communicates with the rest of the hive nodes scattered through the Void and beyond. Some consider the Concordant Chronosphere to consist of just Node Prime while others argue that it exists within all hive nodes simultaneously and that it manifests on Node Prime merely due to its magnitude\u2014and some see it as all of the ahu-nixta combined."

The creature's mature form bears an uncanny resemblance to a putrefied cuttlefish. In the larval stage, bodies possess a similar texture to the adult, though lacking any consistent shape. In cephaloid form, an ahu-nixta can alter its body dramatically, allowing it to stretch its soft and pliable tissues within other structures. This allows them to occupy existing matter and manipulate it. They can also fuse together to manipulate larger objects, working in pairs or even entire colonies, depending on the nature and size of the encasements. Other times, they use their own larva as building material, for mature cephaloids are able to control larva at will. It is unknown if the creatures can also fuse their consciousnesses, though such an ability would account for their advanced intellects and mastery of arcane secrets, void magic, and clockwork constructions.",

The satarre on the other hand see the yugoloths as cowards and backstabbing schemers whose actions delay their own wished-for end of existence. It is not uncommon for the two fiendish races to clash, though in the face of outside opposition, especially by celestials, the two grudgingly cooperate."

										"The demiplane known as the Broken Path has long served as a manifest enigma, promising to some sages a glance inside the quasi-religious secrets of yugoloth society itself. To others however, it seems a poisoned lure to draw those very same who would seek to expose that knowledge to the light, devouring them instead, either by slaughter or by corruption. Regardless, the Broken Path promises knowledge to initiates who dedicate themselves to exploring and understanding the patterns in its bizarre, alien architecture. But while it offers rewards and power, like yugoloth promises to mortals, every step of progress toward gnosis that they make drags them deeper into its grasp and unknowingly binds them to it, more and more deeply until they are physically unable to leave without succumbing, one way or another.",
										"Only 6 miles wide in its entirety, roughly half of that space is beholden to the ruins of an utterly ancient fortress of alien design and its surrounding debris field of bones, seemingly comprised of the remains of every known creature, save those of any yugoloth. As befitting its extreme age, much of the structure has fallen to rubble, though the central ruins are in better condition due to a deep swath of protective wards that keep portions intact and standing, even with the absence of proper load-bearing support. Of the keep itself, its plan is a series of labyrinthine, spiraling corridors, both aboveground and passages burrowing deep below, with a central chamber, several acres wide, open to the looming, roiling sky above. Surrounding the keep are a pentad of slender ancillary towers, of which one is toppled. And another is sheared off halfway up, as if some angry titan had swung at it with a fist millennia earlier, with the upper portion of the tower still suspended in the sky and a roughly 40-foot gap of missing stairwell and walls between it and the extant lower portion.",
										"Runes in the yugoloth dialect of Void Speech spiral across every inch of stone, carved by thousands of different hands, crowding against one another for position and bizarrely appearing on the undersides of fallen stones as well, not just what would have been exposed surfaces in the original structure. The nature of the carvings varies. Most of them are elaborate prayers for various of the Ibshalek, including some either no longer extant or potentially counted among the Waiting Ones, some are tantalizing promises, some are magical formulae of deeply obscure purpose, and still others are warnings directed toward the reader. One motif is repeated, especially upon the ruined entrances, \"Travel the path supplicant, seeking and finding. Know and transcend. Know and find freedom.\" The direct translation of freedom in the yugoloth tongue is dubious and can mean a number of related concepts from \"release from slavery\" to \"knowledge\" to \"oblivion,\" and the specific wording is reported to change when observed by different readers.",
										"The Broken Path has no apparent native life. Whatever purpose it held for its original builders, it is seemingly abandoned, and only the occasional planar traveler is found within. There is, however, evidence of past occupation, both by mortal explorers and by yugoloth pilgrims. The former litter the ruins' periphery with abandoned and still half-stocked campsites, suggesting that they hurriedly fled or never actually left while the latter leave behind numerous impromptu shrines to the Ibshalek, including sacrifices of all manner of sentient creatures and a panoply of scattered ritual materials, the aftermath of religious rites of a distinctly yugoloth flavor.",
										"There are two caveats to this absence of native life. Visitors over the past century report one permanent resident, a disheveled human wizard by the name of Verig Renelik. Obsessed with the Broken Path, the wizard is prone to long, meandering diatribes to himself, his familiar, and non-existent persons who may have been former\u2014though now missing\u2014companions. Left to his own devices, he is non-violent, but if interfered with, he is merciless. Visitors describe him rambling on and on about some great reward promised to him, some unknown truth that he has learned that is otherwise reserved for the Ibshalek themselves. Powerful and paranoid, Verig is convinced that he is close to discovering some final hidden and powerful truth. Often dismissed as mad, others are convinced by one curious realization: the wizard has apparently not aged over the course of the past 200 years, despite the normal flow of time within the Broken Path.",
										"The other caveat resides in the wizard's familiar, Xera, an {@creature ezkiloth|W29PB}. This tiny yugoloth urges on its master's obsession and claims to be the fruit of his advanced understanding of the Broken Path's obfuscated truths. If the demiplane generates yugoloth familiars for those visitors who follow the path, so to speak, it would lend credence to there actually being a dark and hidden truth waiting for the worthy to understand.",
										"So what is that truth? Is it a honey trap to lure powerful and ambitious mortals and, there, bind their souls and thus them into fiendish service? Is a powerful yugoloth, perhaps even one of the so-called Waiting Ones, lurking secluded deep within its core, luring powerful victims to an unknown end? As with everything involving the 'loths, every deeper exploration, like the Broken Path itself, brings no answers but only an ever-deeper and more dangerous level of questions."
