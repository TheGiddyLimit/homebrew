The thinnest sheet of lead can block the most powerful of divination, and it is often used as a mean to protect against magical prying. A purer form of lead, called deep lead or sometimes dimeritium, exists. It is a silvery metal with a hint of blue found only rarely in mineral veins. Deep lead is highly toxic, and those frequently exposed to it regularly experience migraines, respiratory diseases or even seizures. These effects are amplified for magical creatures and spellcasters that will instantly feel nauseous in its presence and intense physical pain at its contact. Witch Hunters rely heavily on deep lead and have integrated in their arsenal several devices based on that metal to face their most dangerous enemy: spellcasters."

Eldritch cults often take to venerate amygdalae, craving communion and guidance from superior beings. Those able to see them are considered chosen, a sign that one has been initiated on the path to transcendence beyond mortality and into the deeper mysteries. Naturally these cults attract mostly raving lunatics that feed into the collective delusion. Ultimately, humanity is seldomly acknowledged by such creatures and merely gravitate around them like buzzing flies, unable to gain entry to the supernal world and merely attempting to satisfy its fantasy of relevance in the cosmic order."

The king is required to be as much a warrior as a diplomat, charged with the difficult task to maintain a semblance of unity among the clans.",

There, he meets with the Earthmother and is judged. If he is accepted, he emerges from the waters wrapped in green and silver mist, reborn as hers and invested by her powers. If he is rejected, he is never seen again, and the pool fills with blood as the mad laughter of Da Dhiogail is heard.",
										"This tradition has prevented the Waelen from having a royal bloodline, for the king has no a queen and his children have no claim to the throne. The death of a High King is always followed by a time of turmoil across the isles, as clans compete against each other to present their best candidates for the throne. Many different types of men have been High King, from conquerors to schemers and diplomats, or even tyrants at times. It takes ambition, courage, and probably a touch of madness to wish for the antler-crown. Only the goddess knows why she picks who she does, choosing who her people need, and not necessarily who they want.",

To defy him is to defy the will of the goddess herself and his position is only rivaled by the leathdhia demigods and the archdruids. The king surrounds himself with oathbound nobles representative of each clan, defending the interest of their homeland. Kinship plays a great deal on the political chessboard, as more than a few High Kings have favored their initial clan throughout their rule. Noble houses also take pride in providing a suitable High King and benefit greatly in influence from his ascension. In theory anybody, man or woman, can wear the antler-crown, but in reality, only a handful of Antler-Queens or plebeians ever ruled.",

These events plunged the isles into chaos, paralyzing the entire society and leaving the Waelen without a ruler. Bloody civil war reaped the isles apart, as each clan reached for domination and the druids debated endlessly on the validity of a new High King without the crown. Thankfully the crown was finally reclaimed from the Northlanders and a new king chosen, but all fear this could happen again."

Fauns are always males but can and do breed with anything. In that regard they often prey on dryads and nymphs, but are also known to carry off brides and other women at weddings. The male offspring are always fauns. Fauns are believed to be originating from the curse of an archfey, cast onto a satyr as punishment for seducing its true love: \"May you look as beastly outside as you are inside, and may all that you sire suffer the same fate.\""

When nekkers venture out as a war or hunting party, they are led by thornhearts, their prophets and leaders. Thornhearts give orders, turning a wild band into an organized unit, thus they should be eliminated first. As malicious as they are, nekkers are cowardly creatures by nature and will not hesitate to flee if too many of them are slaughtered or an opponent seems too dangerous.

If you see one, expect anywhere from 2-10 more. They burrow from beneath the ground or fall from trees and swarm upon their prey. Though primitive, the tactic is surprisingly effective. Nekkers overwhelm their targets through sheer numbers, surrounding them, then pummeling and clawing victims to death. Even veteran adventurers can fall prey to this. When facing large groups of nekkers, it is best to take advantage of tactics that can harm several opponents at once, such as spells and explosives that can help thin out the swarm with ease. As with other agile creatures, running from nekkers is not the best idea, for the monsters will catch up to their prey and swiftly kill it with multiple hits of their claws."

Otherwise they will harass their prey with flyby attacks and stinger shots until its quarry does not have any strength left to fight back. They will then patiently wait for the poison of their stinger to turn the unfortunate victim into a pile of fleshy goo and will come back to collect it, bringing it to their nest to later devour it."

Supported by their order, they carry with them a number of devices to help them in their task such as deep lead shackles, weapons and bombs.",

Many believe that they speak and act on behalf of the clergy, but in truth not all witch hunter are affiliated or even religious. They are more of a mercenary group and their actual legitimacy is pretty nebulous, but questioning it openly is a sure way to be branded a heretic."
