The importance and political sway of an island, beside its military power and wealth, is measured how much it is \"touched by the goddess\", with the presence of moonwells.

The thinnest sheet of lead can block the most powerful of divination, and it is often used as a mean to protect against magical prying. A purer form of lead, called deep lead or sometimes dimeritium, exists. It is a silvery metal with a hint of blue found only rarely in mineral veins. Deep lead is highly toxic, and those frequently exposed to it regularly experience migraines, respiratory diseases or even seizures. These effects are amplified for magical creatures and spellcasters that will instantly feel nauseous in its presence and intense physical pain at its contact. Witch Hunters rely heavily on deep lead and have integrated in their arsenal several devices based on that metal to face their most dangerous enemy: spellcasters."

Should she call upon him, he must fight her battles. However, this is highly theoretical and mainly used as a symbol of his right to rule, for this has not happened in centuries. The king is required to be as much a warrior as a diplomat, charged with the difficult task to maintain a semblance of unity among the clans.",

There, he meets with the Earthmother and is judged. If he is accepted, he emerges from the waters wrapped in green and silver mist, reborn as hers and invested by her powers. If he is rejected, he is never seen again, and the pool fills with blood as the mad laughter of Da Dhiogail is heard.",
										"This tradition has prevented the Waelen from having a royal bloodline, for the king has no a queen and his children have no claim to the throne. The death of a High King is always followed by a time of turmoil across the isles, as clans compete against each other to present their best candidates for the throne. Many different types of men have been High King, from conquerors to schemers and diplomats, or even tyrants at times. It takes ambition, courage, and probably a touch of madness to wish for the antler-crown. Only the goddess knows why she picks who she does, choosing who her people need, and not necessarily who they want.",

To defy him is to defy the will of the goddess herself and his position is only rivaled by the leathdhia demigods and the archdruids. The king surrounds himself with oathbound nobles representative of each clan, defending the interest of their homeland. Kinship plays a great deal on the political chessboard, as more than a few High Kings have favored their initial clan throughout their rule. Noble houses also take pride in providing a suitable High King and benefit greatly in influence from his ascension. In theory anybody, man or woman, can wear the antler-crown, but in reality, only a handful of Antler-Queens or plebeians ever ruled.",

These events plunged the isles into chaos, paralyzing the entire society and leaving the Waelen without a ruler. Bloody civil war reaped the isles apart, as each clan reached for domination and the druids debated endlessly on the validity of a new High King without the crown. Thankfully the crown was finally reclaimed from the Northlanders and a new king chosen, but all fear this could happen again."

A botchling hideous outer appearance, a partially-decayed fetus twisted with hatred and malice, can almost be seen as a metaphor for the ugliness of its predicament, it rises from pure sadness and devastation: the corpse of an unwanted infant abandoned in the wild or from a stillborn baby unnamed and discarded without funeral rites."

The feeling of utter abandonment and the complete absence of love that defines the botchling make it glow like a dark beacon for wraiths that are born from powerful negative emotions.

However, attempting this rite isn't without risks. Firstly, subduing the botchling itself can prove difficult, and secondly its cries during the rite will attract all sorts of hostile specters and undead.

Driven mad with pain or anger, they wander the fields searching for their unfaithful lovers or backstabbing rivals, though they will kill anyone who does not get out of their way in time. They are often held in this world by some object of intense emotional significance. That is why, if one ever finds a wedding ring or torn veil in the middle of a field, one should not pick it up, but instead back away as quickly as possible. Contrary to popular belief, noonwraiths can also be encountered at night, but are much weaker then than during the day."

When the raiding season comes to a halt, or that a clan decides that trading would be more profitable than war, they establish a permanent or temporary trading outpost, welcoming merchants from across the world. These outposts quickly become centers of transshipment, exchange, and redistribution, where spices, furs and weapon trade are especially welcome."

A warp spawn is a formidable opponent on its own, capable of slaughtering an entire group of adventurer, but the threat is poses does not resides solely on the brutal strength and flurry of attack of the creature, but in the corrupting touch that it spreads. The fate of a spawn is to die, either on the field of battle by axe or sword, torn apart in the wilds by even more savage creatures, or literally ripped asunder by the energies that continues to course through its twisted body. Mindless and utterly beyond reason, warp spawn relentlessly attack anything in their way, the blows of their enemies merely a strange relief to the endless insanity that is their miserable existence."

They thrive in the desolation they create and bask in its strange glow. As such, they are rarely found in healthy lands and their presence means that a region is contaminated. They are very territorial predators, attacking on sight any living thing. They are often found in broods of five to ten creatures, but much larger broods have been discovered as well, truly infesting nightmarish regions of the deep Underdark. Their social hierarchy is nebulous at best, as they almost never communicate with other creatures, but they seem to share a hive-mind mentality."

Once their surrounding has mutated to their liking, they establish a nest. The brood scavenges any kind of materials and organic life they can and shape a large \"shell\" from their findings. Once the shell is completed and sealed, half of the brood will liquefy and infiltrate it, merging inside the shell. At that moment, the brood is the most vulnerable, its numbers depleted. Soon after, the shell will start emitting blinding light and deadly energy, vaporizing any that come too close. About a week later, a single {@creature yarghuul broodmother|BoBH} emerges from the shell, ready to lead the brood."

If mounting an ambush, they will use their mutable form to devastating effect, falling from the ceiling or emerging from the ground to surprise their victim. Members of a yarghuul brood use a complex combination of telepathic images, whale-like singing and bioluminescent pulses from their tentacles to communicate with each other."
