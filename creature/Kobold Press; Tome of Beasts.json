It leads with its wicked horns before grabbing hold of its target or another nearby foe and hanging on as it claws its victim to death. The creature relishes the feel of its victim's struggles to escape its embrace and reserves its roar, which sounds like a cross between a toad's croak and lion's roar emanating from a creature the size of a dragon, for organized foes or against overwhelming numbers.

Once mating has been completed (and groves of trees have been destroyed), the female finds a secluded, shallow lake in which to bury eggs. A bukavac reaches maturity in five years, during which time it and its siblings hunt together. After the bukavacs mature, each finds its own lair.",

The creature has a natural lifespan of 40 years, but its noise and proclivity to ambush intelligent prey attracts the attention of hunting parties, which considerably shorten its life expectancy."

She might defeat the vizier whispering lies in the ruler's ear only to discover he was a pawn in a vast conspiracy.
