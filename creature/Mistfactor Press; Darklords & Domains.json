His eyes, always blue, are sky blue when he is at peace and the deep blue of a storm tossed sea when he is angry.",

His eyes explode, leaving him with empty eye sockets. The feathers in his wings fall out, and the skin rots, leaving only thin bones. Despite the loss of his feathers, Diamabel can still fly.",

							"Diamabel was born to rule. He was the son of a sheikh of a powerful tribe of nomads. The nomads controlled important trade routes through the desert and served as guides and protectors for the giant merchant caravans that crossed the desert from the sea to the wealthy cities. When Diamabel was a child, his nursemaid would tell him stories of her far away homeland. In her land, people chosen by the gods were turned into pillars of pure light and taken away to live with their deities for all eternity. At the young age of five, Diamabel knew the path he would tread in life.",
							"As Diamabel grew into manhood he became an accomplished warrior and tactician. He was famed for his devastating night raids on enemy nomad tribes and the caravans they protected. Diamabel always looked beyond the desert, to the seats of the gods and swore one day he would be with them. Diamabel's father had no time for this nonsense. Protecting his people and letting them prosper was his only concern. Time and again Diamabel tried to convince his father that he should follow a heavenly path, but Diamabel's entreaties failed. Diamabel had more success with the rest of his tribe, most of whom began to worship Diamabel. As Diamabel grew older, his relationship with his father became more and more laboured.",
							"When Diamabel was 16 his father suddenly died. Those in the tribe that whispered of poison or murder soon joined their sheikh in death. The tribe of nomads changed with Diamabel's leadership. They no longer protected caravans or raided enemy tribes for supplies and honor, now they were conquerors. Diamabel began to subjugate the nearby tribes. Any that didn't convert to his faith were put to the sword. The few members of Diamabel's tribe that didn't share his belief were slain as well. As Diamabel's power grew, he began to attack the coastal trading towns and wealthy cities that surrounded the desert, putting thousands to the sword, but it wasn't enough. At night, Diamabel would dream of becoming an angel in the service of his god, strong, with a fiery sword in one hand, and carried aloft on feathered wings. In the mornings, Diamabel would wake, still just a man. His frustration and anger drove him to even greater heights of savagery.",
							"At the height of his power, Diamabel moved to raze a village on the edge of the desert, one of the few left that didn't worship his god. The village didn't have the numbers to openly resist, but archers hid in the houses, and took a terrible toll on men and horses. As Diamabel ordered his men to burn the village, an arrow was loosed, and tore its way into his torso.",
							"Diamabel fell from his horse and his most faithful servants surrounded him. Healers were summoned but Diamabel knew it was too late. The arrow had entered too deeply and the wound couldn't be staunched. Diamabel's blood seeped into the hot desert sands and he died. When Diamabel opened his eyes again, he had changed. The arrow was gone and Diamabel had become a perfect being too beautiful and tall to be a man.",
							"At first Diamabel was convinced his god had given him part of heaven to rule, but that belief only lasted until his first transformation. Now Diamabel believes his god is testing him, and with each passing day he grows less patient and forgiving."

Anyone he sees that violates his holy law, or looks like they may violate his holy law, are immediately seized by his Law Givers. The lucky are scourged by the Law Givers, Diamabel's holy enforcers and either let go or slain on the spot. The unlucky are marked by Diamabel himself.",

Take care of it. Make sure it's fed and watered, even if it means you have to go without. Then pray you never go near that island. If you do, release the raven and pray she likes it more than you."

							"No one knows the Lady of Raven's true name, including the Lady herself. She is a petite woman with long dark hair styled around elaborate combs. Her eyes are the same color as her hair and both are a perfect complement to her pale skin. Her demeanor is cold and haughty. The Lady of Ravens looks at people the same way she might look at something she just stepped in. The Lady rarely allows her icy demeanor to crack, and when she does, she can stun people with the force of her personality. Her emotional highs and lows are captivating, to behold. She can dominate a group of people through sheer force of personality alone. The Lady is more likely to relax around the isle of ravens."

							"The Lady of Ravens was born into a world of silence and isolation. She was the last in a long line of nobility that had long fallen into inbreeding and insanity. Her mother died when the Lady was a toddler and the Lady of Ravens neither remembers her nor cares. The Lady's father spent his days in a drugged haze and wandered the halls of the castle, talking to unseen spirits and friends long dead. The Lady never talked to the servants that raised her or took care of her day to day needs,not considering them important enough to matter in any way. The Lady despised the other children that lived in the castle, and they soon learned to avoid her altogether. The Lady of Raven's only joy was the Tower of Flint. A 400 foot tall edifice of gray stone that sat in the middle of her castle, hundreds of ravens roosted in the tower. The Lady of Ravens had inherited the ability to talk to ravens, passed down by her mother. The Lady spent hours in the tower, telling the ravens stories, and listening to the tales they told her in return. After her father's death the Lady rarely left the tower, spending days in conversation with her ravens. This was the way of things until the Lady reached her late teens. Looking out the windows of her tower, she spotted a handsome young man. The Lady became obsessed with the man, the son of a servant, and set her ravens to follow his every move. When he departed to fight in some nameless war, she was devastated, barely sleeping or eating for a year. She was overjoyed to hear the news from one of her ravens\u2014the man had returned. Her joy turned to rage when the young man immediately fell into the arms of another woman.. Devastated and enraged, the Lady sent her ravens to tear the young lovers apart. Grief stricken, the Lady spent several days in her tower mourning the death of her obsession. When she left she found the Tower of Flint was standing alone on a isle in the middle of a vast sea. To make matters worse, the Lady found she could not remember her own name. Even more devastating, although she could command the ravens of her isle with an act of will, she could no longer talk to her friends."

							"The Lady of Ravens is obsessed with talking to her beloved raven friends again. She believes finding her lost name is the key to this, as the ability was passed down from her ancestors, and her name represents her ancestry. If a group of humans lands on the Lady's isle and appears to be well learned or intelligent enough to aid the Lady in her quest, she may offer them treasure or hospitality if they agree to aid her. If they don't agree to help the Lady then she will force them to serve with her magic. The Lady has magical means to track and communicate with her minions.",
							"Occasionally, the Lady of Ravens becomes enamoured with a handsome sailor or adventurer. That individual is gifted a raven as a mark of the Lady's favor. While the raven is alive, that individual will have great fortune in the seas around the Isle of Ravens. The individual will amass great wealth and avoid the worst storms, so long as that raven survives. If the raven dies, the individual loses the Lady's favor instantly, and all his good luck turns to ash\u2014their treasure will be stolen, food will rot in their mouth, and their friends will abandon them or die. Eventually the Lady of Ravens will appear, and change her paramour into a raven to replace her lost friend that she entrusted to that sailor. No raven gifted in this way has lived longer than two months."

If pressed into actual combat, the Lady will use her powerful spells to crush her enemies from afar. If hard pressed, she will command her ravens to attack her foes, but is loath to put her precious birds in danger. Borders: When the Lady of Ravens closes her borders, storms encircle her isle. Any attempt to move through the storm is hopeless. The winds and lashing waves will blind and disorient anyone attempting to cross and push them back to the Isle of Ravens."
