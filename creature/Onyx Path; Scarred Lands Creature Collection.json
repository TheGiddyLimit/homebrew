In 57 AV, a group of elven artists, writers, wizards, and other creative individuals gathered and the city of Turen to discuss their plight. They agreed to assume responsibility for the rekindling the elves' spirits while preserving high elven heritage and culture. Artists from all of the elf realms were rallied and a renaissance movement began, bringing to an end the decades-long dearth of true elven culture. Along with their colleagues' murals, novels, poems, symphonies, sculptures, and architecture, the elven wizards presented new spells and magic items\u2014and their pièce de résistance, the remembrances: constructs tailored like beautiful high elves. The remembrances were designed as testament to erstwhile elven glory, animated cultural archives. Once, they mingled with elves, singing, dancing, reciting myths and legends or even re-enacting famous battles. Intended as keepers of all the joys and pleasures of elven lives and passions, they were intelligent, knowledgeable, and even fully capable of romantic and sexual activities."

The angry elves destroyed most of the renaissance works, including many of the remembrances. The riots continue to this day, and Pelegael survives amid violence and anarchy. After the movement faded, several remembrances secluded themselves in theaters and museums along with other pieces of art, where today they discreetly duplicate ancient masterpieces or pen old stories. Others wander as bards, disguising themselves as living elves. A few others live with sympathetic elven wizards or simply hide in the forests."

Their narrow mouths are filled with dirty, jagged teeth and their large black eyes are covered with a transparent lid. Their rear feet end in wickedly curved claws that they use to scoop prey off the land to take back to their eyries to consume. The long tail of the female sand wyverns ends in a stinger and in a brilliant green gem-scale for males. When sand wyverns travel in large flocks, they have been known to kick up such a great quantity of sand that travellers often mistake their approach for a sandstorm."

If such were the case, then only the most foolhardy (or desperately greedy) adventurer would ever venture to the place. Each of the long, brilliant gem-scales on a male sand wyvern's tail is worth anywhere from 50 to 200 gold coins depending on how far one travels from the desert fringe towns to sell it. Tribes of hardened wasteland nomads who live along the Splintered River in the Ukrudan desert make their living hunting sand wyverns, which they call Angels of Sand. Divine War legends describe asaatthi training sand wyverns as war mounts. Asaatthi children reportedly rode the beasts into battle until they grew too large for the beasts to bear. Rumor holds that the Dunahnae army is trying to replicate this training process."

Though they are carnivores at heart, these creatures will pass right over anything that appears to be already dead, preferring to tear into living flesh. This tactic may seem better than confronting an angry flock of wyverns, but lying down in the desert and having a sandstorm pass overhead can result in being buried alive..."

In the aftermath of the Divine War, people rarely and inexplicably developed the disease (and still do) that marked them as Chern's. Yet, without a titan to command them, they were merely outcasts and liabilities in a world lorded over by gods. The marked still had potential in the Scarred Lands, though. Warrior-priests of Vangal recognized the marked's usefulness as envoys and messengers for their god - and as tools of destruction should disease and mayhem need to be delivered upon Vangal's enemies. The warrior-priests have therefore declared Chern's former pawns now Vangal's chosen\u2014representatives of the god who are not be molested or interfered with without invoking the Ravager's wrath. In truth, Vangal is probably disinterested in these pathetic souls, but they make fine political pawns for his true followers. By order of Vangal's clerics, the chosen must cover their bodies as much as possible (usually with robes and hoods made from rough cloth), as a reminder that Chern has been defeated, and must bear the sign of Vangal prominently to signify their new dedication.",

				"{@i Animal spy} might be a spell that influenced a legend, or perhaps a legend influenced the development of this spell. The sentry crows of Iron Tooth Pass stand watch around the dwarven stronghold there, reporting any news of a threat to their masters. They famously warned the dwarves of King Virduk's approach, and while the dwarves insist the birds are naturally intelligent, others claim that an ancient spell compelled them to their duty.",
				"This spell allows you to compel an animal to go to a place, keep watch, and then report back to you or a creature you designate. Choose a Tiny beast you can see within range. The beast travels to a location you specify and keeps watch there. You must have seen the specified area. The target beast travels for the duration of the spell toward the specified location, covering about 50 miles per 24 hours for a flying messenger, or 25 miles for other animals.",
				"You decide precisely what the beast is watching for when you cast the spell. You can have it keep watch for certain circumstances or activities, such as the advent of a storm or a single group of 20 or more creatures passing through the area. Alternately, you can have it watch for creatures with specific physical characteristics (such as height or weight), of a specific kind (like aberrations or titanspawn), or of a particular type (goblinoid or ratfolk). Finally, you can set a simple chronological trigger, having the beast return after 8 hours, for example.",
				"At the time you select, or once the beast has seen the circumstance, activity, or creatures you specified, the beast returns and relays what it sensed as if via {@spell speak with animals}. The messenger speaks only to you or to a creature matching the description you gave. If your spy fails to reach its destination before the spell ends, it can no longer relay what it sensed, but it still makes its way back to the location where you cast this spell."
