					"In many religions and beliefs, there are stories of the End Times, when the world comes to a deadly and devastating end. Many of these tales denounce the culprit of these world-ending catastrophes to be the people of the world, whose greed and hatred lead them to destroy each other and the rest of the world around them. However, these attributes of destruction give rise to evils above and beyond themselves. When the world is on the brink of collapse, and men, elves and dwarves are at each other's throats, the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse rise from their slumber in the nine hells to wreak havoc across the land.",

					"The final, and most dangerous of the four horsemen. Death travels the world as an old woman, seeking out the old and dying to put to final rest. Whenever Death passes through a town, the number of deadly diseases grows, there is an increase in the number of life-taking accidents, and a sense of looming despair follows her wherever she goes. Although she does not seek to increase her own power, just being in her presence drains even the greatest man of his strength and will to carry on.",
					"Death always wields her canonical scythe, and rides upon her pale horse Despair. She is the last of the four horsemen, because she brings the final stroke to the lives of those subjected to the other three."
