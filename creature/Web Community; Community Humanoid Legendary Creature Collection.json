She'll use legendary actions to keep pushing her aggressive battle routine closer and closer to the enemy, striking them with her warhammer and spiritual weapon as much as possible. Being a cleric herself, she would know how to focus down any healing enemies, and as a retired Verenian Watcher she has a good understanding of how to prioritize a well-balanced adventuring party that is working together."
