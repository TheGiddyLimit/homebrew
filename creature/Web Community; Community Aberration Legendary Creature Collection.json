In the case of Dakkon, the master blacksmith, she commissioned him to forge the Black Blade, a legendary soul-drinking sword under the promise that god-like power would be bestowed upon him. Dakkon toiled each day for 10 years only to be double-crossed and have his soul imprisoned within the blade by Geyadrone upon the sword's completion. For years Dakkon wandered the planes, wondering why she would betray him for seemingly no purpose other than to make him hate her.",
