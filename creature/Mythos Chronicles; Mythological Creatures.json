These spikes served both defensive and offensive purposes, rendering the {@b Aeternae} formidable adversaries in combat.",
				"The origins of the {@b Aeternae} are veiled in the depths of mythological history, with their tales often interwoven with the narratives of gods and heroes. One of the most notable legends recounts the {@b Aeternae}'s engagement in battle against the forces of Dionysus during his expedition to India. In this tale, they proved to be daunting foes, inflicting severe losses on Dionysus' army. Reports regarding the {@b Aeternae} can also be found in the historical accounts of Alexander the Great's conquests. As the Macedonian king ventured into the vast expanses of the known world, he encountered many wonders and challenges, including these mysterious creatures. Historical records and ancient writings provide glimpses of Alexander's encounters with these mythical beings. Arrian, a second-century historian and one of the primary sources on Alexander the Great, documented the Macedonian king's travels and battles in his work ",
				"In conclusion, the involvement of the Aerternae in the campaigns of Dionysus and Alexander the Great is often interpreted allegorically, representing the unforeseen challenges that even deities and heroes might encounter in their quests."
