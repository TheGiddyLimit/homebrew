Living creatures within the mist are vulnerable to necrotic damage. Undead within the mist have resistance to radiant damage. Light within the mist can be no brighter than dim unless created by a spell of 5th level or higher, or equivalent magic. The mist lasts for 1 minute, but a strong wind can disperse it, and sunlight burns the mist away instantly and clears the area such light touches.",

At the end of each of its turns, a creature can make a DC 22 Wisdom saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. If this saving throw fails by 5 or more, the affected creature can't maintain concentration until the start of its next turn"

Ireena ,in my eyes, is shown to be very strong willed and stubborn, despite how much trouble it gets her into.Although she is charmed by Strahd, she realises her situation and is determined to reach safety. Despite her tough exterior, her caring nature shines through in her concern for her family. Sometimes she is a bit cold to the ones surrounding her but in reality she is a charming woman who can wield a weapon as good as she can stand up for herself in a verbal conflict."

According to the lore, he is the first true vampire and the one who defeated mordekainen, while the CR 15 version that the \"Curse of Strahd\" book uses; is similar to a normal vampire who could have never managed to defeat a wizard like morderkainen.

New legendary and lair actions New legendary and lair actions have been added to the ones of the original statblock. They give environmental,flavour and mechanical benefits worthy only to the Lord of Castle Ravenloft. The heart's of sorrow bonus life points have been doubled to make the shielding effect to feel more dreadful.",
							"New Spell list and new spells The spell list of Strahd has been adjusted to the power of someone who has access to the amber temple. I have made his list combat ready. The spells that you can find in the spell list of the book are pretty useless to a final showdown. You can also find new spells of previous editions translated to 5th ed. at the end of this file.",
							"Equipment As the lord of the land, Its totaly unacceptable for strahd to not have magic items equiped when he fights to kill his enemies.

					"Leo Dilisnya was born a noble in Prime Material Barovia in 320 BC. Leo inherited from his stepfather a hatred for the von Zaroviches. Leo plotted not merely to punish them but to make himself the ruler of Barovia. The von Zaroviches would be wiped out entirely. His ailing brother would be installed as Count of Barovia and after a year or two, Leo would assassinate him with poison and make it look like his brother died of his stomach illness. Leo would then succeed as Count of Barovia. The Wedding of Sergei von Zarovich was the moment when Leo struck. The massacre turned out to be somewhat bloodier than had been intended initially. A lot of Leo's family members died because of Strahd, and although he appeared to be fatally wounded he was still alive. The couple to be married, Sergei von Zarovich and his bride Tatyana Federovna, were also dead by Strahd's hand. Unfortunately for Leo, Strahd did not expire but rose up as one of the undead and routed Leo's forces. Leo and his remaining kin went to ground, rightly fearing the vengeance of the vampire that now ruled the realm. Flight to other lands proved to be impossible, for the Mists had cut off the land from its neighbours. The patriarch of the Dilisnyas hid himself away in the Monastery of Silver Threads and prepared himself for the night when Strahd would come. In 398 BC, the Devil came finally to hunt and serve his revenge. Leo's preparations proved to be insufficient. Strahd ended Leo's life, but not his existence. He cursed him with vampirism and then sealed him away in a tomb on the Wachter Estate to be driven mad by hunger before eventually expiring of it.",

Despite her sharp golden gaze that held many steadfast, unwilling to move until granted permission, the rest of her appearance reminded one of an esteemed woman in elaborate paintings; ivory coloured skin, rouge dainty lips that could go from a sultry smirk to a darkened scowl. Her illustrious red mane was done up perfectly, held in place with an articulate platinum headdress with three points and accented with red silk. Her main apparel was a red dress with gold accents that trailed behind her. She wore matching red greaved gloves, the fingertips reinforced and pointed for when she wished to sample how plump her hors d'oeuvres were...",

					"Lady Fiona Wachter comes from a family that has been loyal to Strahd for many years. Fiona's beloved husband died of disease some years ago but she has preserved his body and sleeps with his corpse every night since. Rumor has it, that the corpse is not only used for sleeping. At one point, Fiona attempted to gain power by insinuating her daughter, Stella Wachter, into the Vallakovich Family by hitching her up with Victor Vallakovich. The incident ended disastrously, for Victor's cruel words ending up driving Stella mad, and now she thinks she's a cat. For her part, Fiona locked Stella away in Wachterhaus after the incident. If Stella should ever regain her sanity, she will blame the demeaning abuse and exploitation of her mother. In an effort to overthrow Vargas, Lady Wachter started a fiendish cult and masquerades it as a \"book club\". Lady Fiona also employs an assassin named Ernst Larnak a highly skilled man. The one relationship she does not keep secret at all is her (and the Wachter Family's) loyalty to the master of their dread land, Count Strahd von Zarovich. Fiona wishes to bring glory to her family by ruling Vallaki. She has recruited plenty of lowlives to act as her cultists and she has formed her own council of powerful individuals to help her with her schemes.",

The nobleman is donned in the finest accoutrement; thick black vestments over a periwinkle shirt with white collar fastened in place by an elaborate silver brooch. The cloak he wears over it during abysmal weather is known to have the emblem of his house - an ivory eight-point star with a red cross. A jewelled encrusted rapier rests lazily at his hip, making one wonder if it is for show rather than skilled action when used.",

					"Blumue Huanra has been very privileged from since he was a child. His noble parents paid for the finest personal tutors that Barovia could provide and he took a great shining to history and the arts, especially when it came to both poetry and story weaving. As he grew older his interests shifted to fencing and he bested every single tutor and opponent who challenged him, earning him a very pig-headed outlook that no one could be no better than he, when in truth everyone who faced off against him lost in purpose, in fear of what his parents might do if their son fell into a tantrum at losing. Once reaching adulthood his obstinate view of the world did not change, more so only worsened. Because of his status and vast riches, people would listen to him with bated breath, be it from lesser nobles to the mere common folk, and because of this Blumue took many liberties at bending the truth to suit his own needs and thanks to his exceptional skills as a storyteller could make any lie believable and trustworthy so much so that he, in turn, believed it wholeheartedly himself as nothing but the truth. Any information that is provided to him he then proceeds to turn it into his own, discarding the pieces that don't interest him and formulating new details that he then passes out at a modest fee. While many people see him as a scam artist, they cannot help but fall for his overly charismatic disposition, which the noble in turn uses to his advantage by lavishing himself with the finest of jewelry, vestments and, of course, his love for rich, fine cuisine all at a fraction of the cost. His parents now far too old to do anything reside within their comfortable mansion while Blumue takes the helm of the family mantle. He currently has allied himself with Fiona Wachter to gain the additional power the heightened status provides him with working with such a well-established name in Vallaki, whereas the Lady herself makes use of the plump noble's network of informants and loyalists.",

					"Adran Nalty is of average if squat like build with a sullen complexion consisting of his waxen skin, dark and wet matted hair and jade eyes. His daily attire seemed to be dulled threadbare robes underneath a multitude of misshapen belts and patchwork leather. His black feathered mantle has a noxious odour to it, as if the plumage had been dipped in old entrails before being stitched together. His look is accessorized with hanging small poultices and the skeletons of small creatures. He is never seen without his obsidian staff that at the top is seen clutching onto a pulsating molten crystal. His teeth, riddled with active decay that accurately portray this man's soul.",
					"{@b Background:}",
					"Adran Nalty has been living in the wild for as long as he remembers, taken in at the age of five by a circle of druids after he lost his parents to a wolf attack. The circle of druids in question were not ones of life and blossom but of natural decay. There was something beautiful to him about how both flesh and fauna would disintegrate under the effects, struggling to stay alive until it all disperses in a single last breath or twitch. One may question that fire would be more effective, but that is the one thing above anything that Adran hates, seeing the flames stop the creeping degradation of a blight and overall consuming it. As he became an adult Adran was more proactive at using his druidic abilities to inflict blight amongst living beings - be it beast or man he did not care, as long as he could observe the deteriorating stages of their flesh. It was on such occasion that he had a run in with Lady Fiona Wachter, out on an errand with her alabaster skinned bodyguard. He was in the pursuit of a fleeing commoner, decay already eating through their limbs till they fell at the noblewoman's feet, begging for her aid. Adran pauses for a moment from afar, not wanting to get in over his head, but when the woman instead looked towards the druid, smiles and beckoned him to continue, he grinned widely, baring his rotten teeth before sucking the life out of the hapless victim. Fiona was never one to look a gift horse in the mouth and immediately took to finding out more of the death riddled man before her, learning of the circle of druids he was bonded with at Yester Hill and his desire to see everything crumble to dust. Fiona in turn urged Adran to join forces with her. She could provide him numerous individuals, enemies to her but for him, life to slowly disintegrate. Adran was quick to agree and while the nobleman left with growing thoughts of how achieving her goals will happen so swiftly, the druid himself had other thoughts. The fact of the matter was while Fiona was speaking and working her magic to earn the foul man as an ally, Adran was merely focused on how beautiful Fiona would look while he used his blight magic on her, plus the bonus of a full city for his to decompose... it was so exhilarating. For now he will play the role of an ally until the moment arises that he will launch his own plan of attack.",

His attire consists of torn black cultist robes, clawed gloves and an ornate charcoal expressionless demon mask that hides his features. Should he ever be stripped of his clothing he is to be revealed to be nothing more than an emaciated and elderly bald man with yellowed teeth and a withering stare.",
					"{@b Background:}",
					"Filnen Gustanov used to be of noble standing in Vallaki, his family name commanding a fair amount of respect amongst the merchants and common folk. When he took over the family mantle after his parents' passing, instead of maintaining ties and putting money into the neighbouring businesses his ancestry has long paid into, his wealth turned into funding his growing library of books on the occult. Filnen had always taken great interest in the arcane arts and was captivated by the notion of engaging in a pact with an Other-Worldly being and having access to unlimited power. While a gifted man in magic, try as he might he was unsuccessful in making contact with a patron - unsurprising, truly, given where he lived. He then, begrudgingly, used the books he obtained to become an aptly skilled wizard. By the time he reached his late sixties, nearly all of his family's coffers emptied from his obsession with joining with the occult, he made a journey across town, ready to visit the neighbouring Vistani encampment when his gaze locked upon a mischievous red little fiend like being that was causing some disarray amongst a couple. Their eyes met before the creature scampered away, to which Filnen soon came to an epiphany of what that being was - a beast formed from that of a pact with a patron! Moving as quickly as his weary form could take him, he followed the creature and soon found it meeting with Lady Fiona Wachter. Not one for tact, Filnen immediately bombarded the noble with questions about the creature and what pact she had succeeded to obtain in the world they lived in. While a bit taken aback by the old man's forwardness, Fiona was never one to turn the opportunity away. Taking Filnen under her wing, she explained she was indeed in a pact with a patron and with her help, she could assist with him reaching his goal. She then went on with her plight of how she had grand changes for Vallaki, and those that followed her yet needed firm guidance which Filnen was all too eager to jump on proclaim fealty in exchange for her knowledge. From that day forth he became her general over the other cultists in their faction and despite how old and frail the once noble was, he had an aura about him that both commanded respect and delivered fear to his subordinates. Filnen had no care for those under his foot, seeing them as mere fodder for the fires. No one dared go against him after he made an example out of the first set of fools who tried - he left them in a heaping pile of charred bones and hard plasma. Fiona has no worries of Filnen betraying her and will offer tidbits of information about how to be a warlock - albeit they are only well-thought lies. The old man is known to be wily and tries to garner secrets from the red creature addressed as Majesto, the imp itself more than happy to put the occult obsessed general through pointless task after another.",

					"Jebediah Zonovan has been in service to Strahd since the second to last incarnation of the ever eluding Tatyana. Originally from Krezk, Jebediah had grown weary of the people around him, finding them weak and simpering fools who believed hiding behind their walls would protect them from anything. Having no ties to any living family, nor any friends or loved ones he cared for, he set off to Castle Ravenloft one night and swore his allegiance to the ruling vampire. Why the human was turned not many of Strahd's minions could understand, except for perhaps his chamberlain, Rahadin, who believed his master saw a spark of his youth in the young man. Since his turning, Jebediah acquired a taste for beauty... albeit a bit skewered. Ravens plucked of their feathers and pinned by their wings to stained glass, to horses sliced open from the belly up and turned inside out with broken bones and to finally his human prey with blood sputtering from their slashed open and skinned necks he keeps as trophies. That which he fabricates he sees as a work of art when deep down it is simply a degraded monstrous game of cat and mouse, a game that he excels rather well in both a battle of weapons or words. The vampire has recently been assigned to be a bodyguard to Lady Fiona Wachter as well as be an informant to his Lord of what the devious woman was conspiring. Jebediah himself finds it a fool's errand, feeling he is far worthier than such simple babysitting duty, yet he keeps to it, hoping to prove to Strahd that he is not only trustworthy and reliable but worth so much more... perhaps even to obtain the title of Chamberlain and Strahd's right-hand man. Until then he maintains his duty over Fiona Wachter however he rather tends to enjoy lording over the Lady's head of how her decisions may not be favourable to Strahd. Fiona herself is not fond of the vampire assigned to her but keeps her opinions to herself as she does enjoy having the added protection for any who try to rise against her.",

					"The first thing that is noted of Heskel is his sculpted musculature, followed soon after by his intimidating aura that warns those to not mess with such a man. His face is obscured by an ornate white harlequin mask, only showing his maroon and teal coloured hair. His clothing is a torn silver bodysuit with repetitive black symbols of a broken sun throughout. In one hand he clasps his worn shield with a blood red cloth, and in the other his sharpened scimitar with the hilt wrapped with a teal coloured cloth - the blade itself has an intricate pattern of a black dragon. His exposed left shoulder shows a tattoo depicting a speared crow in flight with blood pooling in the centre. If he is ever to be demasked, all that can be seen is a scarred face with unnatural white eyes of a vistana.",
					"{@b Background:}",
					"Born in the Vistani encampment south of Vallaki, Heskel was a free-spirited lad, not seeming to have a care in the world. With such a disposition he had a fairly happy childhood growing up. Unfortunately for his parents, he had a penchant of getting into trouble with his people. Heskel never fully grasped the idea of property, or ownership, believing that everything that the world provided was up for grabs and nothing, not even the clothes on one's back belonged to a sole individual. This definitely got him into trouble with the other Vistani when he took their much-desired wine though he often would make them forget of such anger when he would pilfer the pockets of potential customers. One day his lack of belief in ownership got him in trouble when he took a roasting chicken from an encampment of hunters who, unfortunately for Heskel, had no love for the Vistani as they saw them as lesser beings. He was chased down through the woods. Finally he got cornered and beaten on when suddenly the pain stopped. He could hear the agonizing screams of pain coming through the souls of his attackers. Looking up, his breath was caught in his throat, seeing a beautiful woman dressed in red with a grinning imp on her shoulder. She leaned over him and magically treated his wounds. He soon learned that the woman was Lady Fiona Wachter, a noble from Vallaki who was on her way back from a meeting with the Devil when she happened upon him. Heskel at once became very attached to the woman and asked her as many questions as he could, desperate to know everything about her. Fiona felt her heart soften for such a child, wishing her own children had such an eagerness to learn, not only about their mother but the world she lived in. She then decided to take it upon herself to dote upon the child, teach him everything she could. Multiple times during the week she would visit him at the Vistani encampment, and even bring him back with her through Vallaki's walls. Heskel's own people had no qualms with this, seeing the young Vistana as a way to get access to the town they've long since been banned from. As Heskel grew older so did his fondness for Fiona that as she revealed more of her plans for conquest, he became increasingly worried of those that would usurp, or even worse, take her life. This desperation of wanting to protect who he viewed as his pseudo-mother became so strong that he went to seek out none other than Jenny Greenteeth, the hag who lived outside Lake Zarovich. Pleading his desperation for protecting Fiona, the old woman offered an ornate magical mask, said not to only provide healing to those that are wounded but even bring one back from the cusp of death. Heskel immediately jumped at the mask, not even balking when the cost of ten years of his own life was required for its exchange. No price was too great to protect the woman he adored. Since then, Heskel has been training and honing both his body and mind to be a stalwart defender of Fiona. He often would fool opponents in combat with appearing as if he was a fumbling fool fighting left-handed with his scimitar before delivering the decisive blow. His outlook of no one owning anything has not changed and would still leisurely take things from others, even Fiona's other allies. He especially enjoyed stealing from Jebediah, loving when he elicited specific reactions of annoyance or anger that made the undead man oh so attractive in Heskel's eyes. Despite the trouble he caused to the others, he was steadfastly loyal to Fiona and would do anything for her, even laying down his life like a good son would do for his beloved mother.",

					"Strahd's journal gives a different perspective, and explains that it was in fact Kasimir who led the Dusk Elves in stoning her to death. He was incensed that his sister would choose to explore evil magics and take up with Strahd romantically. He killed her as a way to \"save her from damnation.\" It was for this that Strahd sent his Dusk Elf chamberlain Rahadin to exterminate the women of the clan and lop of the male's ears.",
					"Nerilynn saw a woman she believes to be Patrina in a Dream Pastry induced vision.",
					"Kasimir believes her spirit is flooding him with dreams and visions. This has led him to discover a place, the Amber Temple, far to the south near Mount Ghakis. These visions have led him to believe this frozen place holds the secret to Strahd's power as well as the key to his destruction.",
					"Patrina is believed to be entombed in the bowels of Castle Ravenloft."
