									"Huge, squat beasts with powerful legs and a thundering croak, the gronk are also known as \"hopping rocks\" or \"stone frogs.\" The ill-tempered beasts pose a threat to the nomadic bariaur tribes that roam the Outlands, and those tribes occasionally mount hunting parties solely to thin the gronk's numbers. According to the bariaur nomads, gronk have existed on the Outlands for as far back as five bariaur generations. Their numbers have not increased substantially during that time, mostly due to bariaur thinning gronk herds with their rites of passage. A number of planewalkers have sighted the gronk on several Prime worlds as well.",

											"When a creature comes within its line of sight, a gronk emits a thundering croak and hops toward the target to smash it to death with its spiked headplate. All gronk are nearly deaf, and bright visual displays irritate them. Tales tell of wizards who cast {@spell dancing lights} into gronk herds to drive them into a frenzy. This results in the gronk turning on themselves until nearly every member of the herd is dead.",
											"The gronk are so ill tempered that they can't even tolerate their own species. Despite their herd mentality, the strength of the herd depends on the gronk's emotional cycle, and members of a new herd can survive for a week at most before becoming irritated with one another. Soon after, their natural hatred gives way to furious bouts of head smashing. The herd then dissolves and reforms into new herds several months later."

The ridged spikes that cover the gronk's headplate are actually buds that exchange reproductive material when two gronk smash their heads into each other, then subsequently fall off. If a fallen bud touches dirt, sand, earth, or rock, it submerges a few inches beneath the ground, only to burrow forth a few months later as a tiny gronk.",
											"The gronk have never been seen to eat; it is a mystery how they sustain themselves. A gronk's lifespan ranges from three to five years. As a gronk ages, its headplate cracks and flakes off until the creature suffers brain failure and dies."

											"The gronk also have bladder-like glands along their necks and upper backs that can be removed with care after a gronk is slain. When treated with the right resins and filled with acid, the gland sacs can be used as grenades, and are known to be extremely effective against fiends."
