					"Drow Assassin. People do not fear drow assassins as much as they fear the drow scourges, due to the difference in notoriety. A lesser breed of killers would allow for a reputation of bloodshed to precede them, but drow assassins are not the most reputable humanoid killers of the Underdark, they are the deadliest. Little is known to others about these drow Occasionally, a noble will be found with their throat slit, or a party of adventurers will suddenly go missing. Drow assassins are not only careful in masking their handiwork, but will execute it with unheard of proficiency"
