The githyanki remained an eternal thorn in Velgilt's side, and battles between githyanki raiders and Velgilt's colony were frequent. In one particular battle, Velgilt's nautiloid was destroyed, and his colony was slaughtered. Velgilt was only barely able to escape, teleporting to the Prime Material Plane.",
					"He then retreated to an underground region in your campaign setting, plotting and planning. He began to kidnap humanoids and use the process of ceremorphosis to turn them into mind flayers. Soon after this, Velgilt found a home in caves underneath the sewers of a large city, and continues to expand his colony.",

City goers who find themselves in the sewer are quickly taken through the walls by Velgilt or one of his allies. Here, either brains are eaten or they are turned into mind flayers themselves.",
