					"Neomites are the result in a divergence in the reproductive cycle of a mind flayer tadpole, typically if an elder brain is killed. As they are no longer utilized as food or implanted into a donor brain, these tadpoles are able to grow to the size of small dogs. Despite their small size, they are extremely ravenous and feral creatures driven by their hunger for the minds of living creatures. Neomites prowl the tunnels of the Underdark in search for sentient prey and are especially attracted to the psionic hubs generated by an illithid colony. Due to their mutations, they are able to absorb all forms of psychic attack using it instead to heal their wounds. These creatures produce a unique corrosive acid that is able to quickly dissolve the brain and nervous system of their prey making it extremely easy for them to devour their prey's brain in a single bite."
