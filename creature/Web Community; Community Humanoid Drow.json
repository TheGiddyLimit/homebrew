A majority of driders (60%) were priests of 6th or 7th level before they were changed, all other driders were mages of 6th, 7th, or 8th level.",

Driders are usually found alone or with 2d6 huge spiders (10% chance), rather than with drow or other driders. They are violent, aggressive creatures that favor blood over all types of food. They stalk their victims tirelessly, waiting for the right chance to strike.",

					"{@b Description}",
					"Silverhair Knights are an order of elite priests of Eilistraee. They are mostly female drow, elves and half-elves, although males are allowed to become Silverhair Knights too. Silverhair Knights pursue a very specific goal: they want to redeem evil drow from the underdark, purifying their souls and granting them the chance for a new life on the surface.",
					"To achieve this, Silverhair Knights train non-lethal combat techniques with their swords, learn spells to incapacitate their opponents without damaging them and generally attempt to use their blessed serene voice to calm down any conflicts before they actually start engaging in combat.",
					"In addition, Silverhair Knights are blessed with the ability to use an unique kind of magic for redeeming someone, for purifying their souls: They essentially consume their target's sins into their own soul, where they are destroyed by radiance and purity - and thus, they are known as Sin Eaters.",
					"Silverhair Knights usually accompany Sword Dancers and Darksong Knights on missions in the underdark. While the others fight off dangerous monsters and demonic servants of Lolth, the Silverhair Knights attempt to calm down drow, try to protect them and to convince them to come with them to the surface, and if they don't succeed, they use their various tools to incapacitate the drow until they can later purify their souls.",
					"{@b Non-Lethal Combat.} Silverhair Knights have vowed to never willingly kill any drow. They are specialiced in techniques for nonlethal combat with both their swords and spells, focusing on incapacitating their enemies, exhausting them or otherwise making them give up fighting. They know how to hit their enemies with a sword to neutralize them without using lethal force, how to bring them down to the ground, where they can be tied up, and how to deter them of potentially dangerous reactions.",
					"However, despite generally fighting nonlethally, Silverhair Knights still are respectable and capable combatants, who can easily apply lethal force to kill powerful enemies if necessary.",
					"{@b Blessed Enchanters.} The second important tool Silverhair Knights use for nonlethal combat are their spells. In addition to regular cleric spells they know a wide array of non-damaging enchantment spells specialiced for incapacitating and otherwise neutralizing combatants to prevent casualties. Their blessed voice of redemption makes these enchantment spells particularly effective tools, allowing them to overcome even the innate resistance to charming effects drow just like other elves are known for.",
					"In addition, Silverhair Knights can use a special kind of enchantment magic, which is particularly effective against evil drow - they can make them feel the weight of all sins they committed,  which not just makes them thinking about changing their way of life, it also distracts them in combat, makes them unwilling to continue the fight and can even stun them or cause mental damage.",
					"{@b Sin Eating.} A Silverhair Knight can perform a special ritual on another conscious creature with an evil alignment, whether that creature is willing or not, to consume its sins, redeeming it and taking the full weight of cruelty and suffering inflicted by it. The ritual lasts 10 minutes and the Silverhair Knight must be touching the target for the full duration. Once the ritual is completed, the target creature feels the weight of all their sins on their conscience, understands the errors it made in its life and regrets its past actions. The target is then freed of all evil, causing its alignment to change to good. The sins themselves are absorbed into the Sin Eater's soul and destroyed by its radiance and purity.",
					"With each sin eating ritual performed by the Silverhair Knight there is a cumulative 5% chance of it failing as it is overcome by the sins it is trying to absorb. In this case, the Silverhair Knight falls unconscious for 24 hours and the target is not freed of their evil. At the end of that period, the Silverhair Knight must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a success, the Silverhair Knight wakes up, on a failure however, the Silverhair Knight dies and rises as a ghost with the same evil alignment as the target of the failed ritual."

					"Darksong Knights are an order of elite crusaders and warrior-priests of Eilistraee.They are mostly female drow, elves and half-elves, although males are allowed to become Darksong Knights too. Generally, Darksong Knights are specialiced on hunting down and slaying the demonic servants of Lolth, such as yochlols.",
					"Darksong Knights usually are fighting in small groups, supporting each other. Sometimes, a group of Darksong Knights is lead by some Sword Dancers who provide additional striking forces, inspire them to fight and back them up with their powerful spells. More often though they are accompanied by Silverhair Knights who take care of any drow they come across, saving and redeeming them using their special abilities to awaken and devour sins.",
					"{@b Battledancers.} Darksong Knights practice a dance-like fighting style, similar to but not as artistic and perfected as the battledance performed by Sword Dancers; however, Darksong Knights on the other hand have perfected the art of feinting as part of their style to lure an enemy into exposing their weak spots. If a creature falls for a feint and thus is caught off-guard, it easily loses balance due to the force behind the attack and, which is particularly useful against spellcasters, such a surprise can easily lead to someone dropping their concentrating.",
					"{@b Light into the Dark.} Darksong Knights bring the silvery light of the moon, the light of Eilistraee, with them to fight dark demons. They can use said light to mark and weaken their enemies - which also forces shapechanged yochlols to reveal their true forms. Another ability related to the light Darksong Knights have is their Crescent Moon Strike. This ability allows them to summon blades of light, which they can hurl across the battlefield, burning away the darkness and blinding their foes."

					"{@b Description}",
					"Sword Dancers are elite priests of Eilistraee, the Dark Maiden, blessed with the ability to channel Eilistraee's power in an unique way - through the so-called Spellsong. They are mostly female drow, elves and half-elves, although males are allowed to become Darksong Knights too. While there is no official hierarchy amongst the followers of Eilistraee, Sword Dancers often are considered to be the most powerful ones, especially when it comes to combat.",
					"Becoming a Sword Dancer is a difficult endeavour, as it requires both rigid following of rules such as having been on the surface for long enough, regularly performing rituals, singing and dancing each night in the moon's light to receive Eilistraee's blessings, and a great amount of training, far more than what is required for other orders of followers of Eilistraee.  A Sword Dancer is not just a master of combat, they are masters of the arts of song and dance too, they are fit acrobats and skilled diplomats.",
					"Unlike the fairly narrowly specialiced orders of Silverhair Knights and Darksong Knights, Sword Dancers perform a broad spectrum of activities. They fight as warriors for Eilistraee on missions both on the surface and in the underdark, they use their diplomatic skills to promote harmony between drow and other races and to generally improve the acceptance of surface drow, and they aid the local population by supplying them with food, water and by curing curses and diseases to establish friendships and a place where drow can live on the surface world.",
					"{@b Eilistraee's Front.} Sword Dancers usually lead and fight at the frontline of missions to to free other drow from Lolth's web, to bring them out of the underdark, to the surface world. Sword Dancers usually fight in groups to make full use of their Spellsong, lone Sword Dancers usually avoid fighting until they can gather some allies - although even a lone Sword Dancer is a force to be reckoned with. On missions in the underdark, Sword Dancers usually are accompanied by Silverhair Knights and Darksong Knights, who are specialiced on redeeming drow and hunting down Lolth's demonic servants respectively.",
					"{@b Wielders of the Singing Swords.} Each Sword Dancer wields a sword, which by itself gives off a faint singing while drawn, echoing the Sword Dancer's own song. These swords, known as singing swords, are blessed by Eilistraee and bear powerful magic within them. However, only a skilled Sword Dancer capable of properly combining swordplay, song and dance on the battlefield, which by itself requires countless of hours of training, can awaken the sword's magic: the Sword Dancer's mind becomes shielded from any spells and other effects that would negatively affect it and the accuracy of the Sword Dancer's strikes reaches levels beyond imagination, even the toughest armor is sliced through like butter and even the most elusive enemy is caught by the sword's blade.",
					"{@b Moonlight Missiles.} The {@spell magic missile|PHB} spell, bestowed upon them by Eilistraee in a version that creates missiles of pure, silvery moonlight, has a special value for Sword Dancers, as they have learned to incorporate it into their performances in various ways, making it a highly efficient tool in combat. When cast on their own sword, it causes white and blue flames to erupt from the blade empowering the strike, when cast in the sky, the missiles combine into a ray of moonlight, and when the missiles wave and twirl around a dancing Sword Dancer like little lights of moonfire, they protect the Sword Dancer from attacks.",
					"{@b Spellsong.} Sword Dancers are capable of using a special kind of magic known as the Spellsong.  By singing, they can focus on their magic even in the midst of combat, being able to cast spells of up to 4th level and incorporate them seamlessly into their dance-like fighting style.",
					"However, what truly makes the Spellsong unique is the fact that multiple Sword Dancers can sing together as a choir to cast spells of much greater power. Combining their voices does not only result in a beautiful piece of music, it also results in great feats of healing and resurrection - or in devastation on the battlefield.",
					"{@b Spellsong Choir Spells}",
					"If at least three Sword Dancers are within 60 feet of each other, they all have access to the following additional spells and spell slots. These spells do not require material components, but they always require verbal components when cast by Sword Dancers, even if they usually don't. The Sword Dancers share these spell slots amongst themselves and can also use them to upcast their own spells:",
