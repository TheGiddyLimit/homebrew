								"Hidden underneath the everyday world is a dark, mysterious realm. There are some areas lit by phosphorescent plants, but most are cloaked in inky darkness. Narrow tunnels branch off into massive hidden caverns filled with stalactites and stalagmites. The colors of the rock range from gray to brown to tan. Fast flowing rivers lead into huge black lakes that never seem to end. Immense ravines are bridged by flimsy, rotten rope bridges. Streams of lava boil and ooze through solid rock. Elegantly carved dwarf and dark elf cities rise out of nowhere. This dim world is inhabited by many creatures, in fact there are entire societies thriving away from the sun.",
								"The dwarf and drow kingdoms stretch for miles and miles. The orcs, duergar, deep gnomes, and minotaurs also have a strong presence. Patrols of humanoids sent out as scouts and spies are everywhere. All the Underworld races have many long running conflicts that will affect any visitors to this land. Hideous monsters lurk in the dark and make this an extremely dangerous place to visit. The unimaginable is ordinary in this bizarre world."

								"Bearing in mind the lack of light and chaotic nature of the Underworld is very important. Many adventuring parties will have to rely on torches, lanterns, {@sense darkvision}, or magical sources of light. However, these sources have their limits. Even with {@sense darkvision}, creatures can only see so far and only shades of gray. Light sources will alert monsters of any visitors. Many of the denizens of this land can see in the dark and will have an advantage. Much of the travel will be in difficult terrain with the slippery ground and rubble littered everywhere. Getting lost in this underground territory is not uncommon. The terrain is unforgiving and unpredictable. Some groups of adventurers might have to rope themselves together. It's difficult to navigate for an hour, let alone days or weeks. Having mounts to carry equipment, food supplies, and other gear will help some groups immensely. Of course, these caravans will have to be protected.",
								"Eventually a party will need to strike a camp. When they do, they'll make themselves known. Food and clean water are also scarce. Adventurers might have to search long and hard for food and even then, they might not be sure what they're eating. Sound also travels in unusual ways in this world. Echoes could confuse the party or sounds from far away could warn of dangers. This is not an easy place to survive. It is a harsh and extremely dangerous land.",
								"For the Game Master, it's an easy place to keep the party on their toes. Many areas have narrow tunnels or have the possibility of cave-ins or other kinds of rockfall. Ambushes are easy to set up and put the adventurers at a disadvantage. A group of heroes might have to find their way across an area that has no solid ground. Any enclosed areas could also put the party in a very precarious position. There are also dangerous cliffs to negotiate. A character might simply lose their footing and fall into a chasm.",
								"Another element that could add more challenges is changing the way magic works. A Game Master could create an Underworld where magic doesn't work all the time, or in the same way. Spells that help the players travel around might not work in such an alien realm. Magical light might also not work in the same fashion as on the surface world.",
								"Overall, the Underworld is a setting that will challenge any adventuring party and the heroes should be prepared for anything."
