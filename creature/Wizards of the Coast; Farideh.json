				"Farideh is a warlock, using her powers to protect the people she cares about (and the various cities she travels to) from the Nine Hells and other villainous groups. Adopted by a male dragonborn named Mehen, she has an identical twin, Havilar, who fights with a glaive and is a bit flighty. Farideh gained her powers when Havilar accidentally summoned Lorcan, a cambion from the Sixth Layer (Malbolge) who happened to be looking for an heir of Bryseis Kakistos, the Brimstone Angel, to fill out his set. Farideh happened to be that heir as well as being hungry for better control over her life and a way to protect her sister. She was easily swayed by Lorcan, who is very attractive and very manipulative.",
				"Bryseis Kakistos is a warlock who performed a ritual with twelve other tiefling warlocks to help Asmodeus ascend to godhood and change the tiefling race to become true-breeding Asmodeans. All tieflings who descend from that time are Asmodeans because of her coven, the Toril Thirteen. Bryseis Kakistos wasn't given her promised reward swiftly enough, and she began scheming, which led to her death. Twenty-five years ago, she escaped the Nine Hells and attempted to reincarnate through her heirs and followers, but the zygote she attempted to attach to twinned in the process, tearing her ghost apart.",
				"Two pieces remained, which the twins' souls eventually formed around. With these two pieces resides the knowledge of how to destroy the god of sin.",
				"During the Sundering, Farideh and Havilar developed powers as Chosen of Asmodeus. What they do not realize is that these powers were actually meant for Bryseis Kakistos, the payment for her assistance. But Asmodeus also knows that the knowledge of his doom resides in the twins\u2014and wishes them thoroughly and quietly taken care of.",
				"Why were they not dealt with sooner? Both twins have a powerful protection laid upon them, which makes them impossible to scry on without workarounds in place (for example, Lorcan collects a sample of Farideh's blood, which allows him to call up the rest of her blood) and which repels the ghost of Bryseis Kakistos. The origins of the protection are unknown; some speculate it might have something to do with Selune and a tiefling called Alyona that Bryseis Kakistos can't quite remember.",
				"The twins are connected to the Harpers of Waterdeep, having assisted Tam Zawad in a mission before he became a High Harper. Two of their companions are Harpers: Dahl Peredur (a fallen paladin of Oghma and Harper handler) and Aubrin \"Brin\" Crownsilver (a Cormyrean nobleman and field agent-at-large).",
				"They have also clashed with devils, Zhentarim, Netherese wizards (dead and alive), Red Wizards, aboleths, Cormyrean nobles, and Ashmadai cultists. Books so far have been set in and around Neverwinter, the Nether Mountains, Waterdeep and the High Forest, and Cormyr.",

Tapping into this power, she gets a sense for how corrupt someone is and can tell where the creature lies along the spectrum of good/neutral/evil. Additionally, she can tell if the creature has been essentially claimed by a deity, such as a cleric or paladin, or even one of the Chosen."

Each of these creatures must succeed at a {@dc 17} Wisdom saving throw or be {@condition frightened} and be affected as though struck by a ray of enfeeblement. At the end of each of its turns, an affected creature can make another Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the creature is immune to Farideh's aura of menace for the next 24 hours. The aura of menace lasts up to 1 minute and requires {@status concentration}.",
								"Additionally, while the effect is active, Farideh is surrounded by a nimbus of flame, and a pair of fiery wings appears to sprout from her back. Farideh and anyone or anything she is holding are immune to the heat from this fire. Whenever a creature within 5 feet of you hits her with a melee attack, the nimbus erupts with flame and the attacker takes {@damage 2d8} fire damage.",
