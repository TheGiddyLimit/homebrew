					"Most creatures perceive ambush drakes as deadly draconic hunters of limited intelligence. However, they are social creatures among their own kind. Ambush drakes share the classic dragon mentality of hoarding treasure, but a pack doesn't believe in individual ownership. While one ambush drake might use an item at any given moment, the pack owns the treasure, and tomorrow another ambush drake might use it.",
					"An ambush drake prefers to move about on all fours, using terrain for cover until they are close enough to charge their prey. An ambush drake typically weighs 200 pounds and has a 5-foot-long body. Its scales display dark shades of red or brown, allowing him to move unseen in the mountains or rocky badlands of Athas. Ambush drake live in rocky areas, and like to hide in caves during the coldest hours of the night. They are usually hunting during the day, leaving with the sunrise and returning in their lair with the sunset.",
					"Ambush drakes can speak Common and Draconic, but rarely choose to do so. Instead, they communicate telepathically with their kind. Ambush drakes share a communal consciousness, enabling them to communicate telepathically with other ambush drakes.",
					"Encounter",
					"Ambush drakes generally stalk their prey as a coordinated pack. They start by using their breath weapons and focus attacks on affected creatures, ignoring quicker fleeing prey."

Little is known about the origins of the anakores. According to an ancient tale, terrors from beyond the sky touched the humanoids that were forebears of the creatures. Afterward, these ancestors recoiled from the burning sun and burrowed below the wastes to find cool, embracing darkness. Beneath the sands, the creatures dreamed dark reveries and became nightmares of the desert. No discernible characteristics distinguish anakores as male or female. It is whispered that the creatures produce no young, instead dragging selected victims to weird hollows under the sands. Inside these wombs, the captives become new anakores rather than meals. How and why the anakores choose particular individuals as their new kin is unknown.",
					"Encounter",
					"Anakores avoid battle on terrain in which they cannot burrow. They appear with others of their kind or with other burrowing creatures such as bulettes, hejkins, galeb duhrs and kruthiks. Wasteland raiders convince groups of anakores to work for them by paying the creatures with food and shiny baubles. Dreams and visions also entice anakores to explore ancient ruins where other aberrant creatures dwell, some of which are stronger and cleverer than even the dune kings. In such places, anakores serve these creatures and join in their incomprehensible rites. Anakores burrow under prey before rising to attack. Hunters emerge, grab targets, and use drag under to reduce the number of enemies they must face. Renders burst from the sands, stay among the prey topside, and lay targets low to make them more vulnerable to allied attacks. A dune king launches into battle with sand eruption and uses its toxic claws to prevent the quarry from escaping. When caught in poor tactical situations, anakores flee or deal peacefully (but grudgingly) with enemies.",

Each individual sees to its own needs, fattening up on weeds and tiny prey, and storing water in a sac under its bony back shell. When larger prey is found, the pack works together for the promise ofa good meal for all. All baazrags are born female. Some members of a pack become male when an egg-laying breeder is nearby. These males tend to the breeder, defending her and her eggs as well as any hatchlings. Powerful baazrags have a natural psychic sensitivity.

If a baazrag is born among other types of creatures or becomes accustomed to those who offer it food and comfort, it considers such beings to be part of its pack. Clever humanoids use this trait to tame baazrags as guard beasts. Baazrags tend to ignore creatures they cannot eat, such as undead. These inedible creatures, in turn, treat the baazrags similarly and ignore them. Thus, explorers might find a lair being shared by the two groups. Baazrags gain confidence, focus, and ferocity in numbers. Although they hunt singly, each baazrag acts as a scout for the pack. When a hunter finds prey, its distinct call brings its mates to swarm over the target. The baazrags relentlessly bite this prey and follow the creature until it falls or it proves too tough to pull down, forcing the baazrags to retreat. A baazrag breeder enters combat by culling a victim from the herd with psychiClure. Then it pounces on that individual, distinguishing it as a target for at least a few of its brood.",

Young braxats are trained to fight from the time they can stand. Deadly combat between young braxats over potential mates, lairs, or treasure is encouraged to ensure that only the strongest and cleverest survive to reproduce.",
					"Once a young braxat is deemed worthy to join a warband, that group becomes his or her second family. Switching to a different warband occurs only rarely usually when most of a band has been killed in battle. Aggression between bandmates is strictly forbidden, since cooperation is vital to a successful hunt. Killing a bandmate is punishable by the immediate execution of both the offender and his or her family.",
					"Info",
					"A braxat can grow so large and psychically powerful that only the strongest creatures on Athas can hope to oppose it. These braxat lords view most other beings as prey or potential slaves-those that don't end up in a lord's belly usually end up serving its dark whims."

					"these four-armed giantkin wander the deserts in small nomadic bands, eking out primitive existences, guided by primal spirits. Their dull minds encourage their simple ways. But the bestial brohgs are rarely left alone - to the contrary, other Athasians conscript them to fight as gladiators in the arena or as soldiers on the battlefield.",
					"Lore",
					"Brohgs are simple giantfolk with archaic ways. While wandering in small bands or living in sheltered dwellings among cliffs or canyons, they listen to the whispers of primal spirits and world-bound elementals. They rarely use the primal magic granted by these entities except to find food and water. Instead, brohgs lead moderate lives, taking only what they need from the land and occasionally meeting with other brohgs to mate and swap stories. Despite its dim intellect, the typical brohg is a capable survivalist and naturally talented at combat.",
					"A brohg that focuses its attention on the fighting arts, as the elite hunters among free brohgs do, becomes a skillful warrior. This talent makes brohgs targets for slavers looking for gladiator and soldier slaves. Brohgs that learn the value of their abilities flee the slavers and become mercenaries instead.",
					"Every brohg has a natural sense for arcane magic, which the four-armed creatures see as a blight brought to Athas by evil spirits. They believe that arcanists traffic with foul, unseen beings, so brohgs distrust all arcanists and hate all defilers. It is possible that some great harm came to brohgs long ago through the misuse of arcane power, or that the brohg race was spawned through the manipulation of such energy.",
					"Once in every generation or two, a brohg is born with innate arcane power that manifests in adolescence. Afraid to kill the accursed one for fear of releasing evil spirits, the tribe banishes the renegade into the wastes, where it travels alone and lives as a hermit. Few such renegades have the wherewithal to learn anything more difficult than defiling sorcery. The use of defiling magic eventually taints these brohg renegades, and their belief that they are possessed by evil spirits hastens their corruption.",
					"Encounters",
					"Brohgs keep hardy beasts as pets. They also ally with earth creatures such as galeb duhrs, other giants, and some humanoids. A brohg might be found as a mercenary or a slave soldier among civilized folk or in an arena. Evil creatures join forces with malevolent brohg renegades, and in a few cases, such renegades have set themselves up as masters of other degenerate brohgs.",
					"Info",
					"Brohgs dislike spellcasters and are enraged by defilers and by those who abuse arcane magic. Such talents are taboo among brohg tribes. When a brohg is born capable of using magic, it is branded a renegade among its own kind."

It closely resembles the rare flowering oasis cactus, whose juicy fruit is salvation for lost and thirsty travelers.

Those cacti that were not destroyed found their way into the desert. Hunter cacti are opportunistic hunters that grow and stay where prey is plentiful, moving on from poor hunting grounds. They rely on their camouflage as they wait for distracted or unobservant creatures to come close. A cactus might leave an occasional corpse uneaten, in hopes of attracting scavengers that make a better meal. The flesh of a hunter cactus is succulent and nourishing, a tasty reward for those who turn the tables on it.",

They might form short-term alliances with creatures that lure prey to them. A few are forced into the service of more powerful beings and constantly look for a chance to escape.",

Precarious cliffs are a great setup for air drakes, volcanic fissures favor fire drakes, and unstable underground burrows make tricky settings for encounters with earth drakes.

					"Drakes loom large in the myths of athas",
					"Though tales of them might scare children, few people believe these giant monsters exist. Those who find out the truth rarely survive the experience-the soft flesh of humanoids is drakes' favorite food.",
					"Lore",
					"Athasian drakes are enormous, fearsome predators having only animal intelligence and strong instincts. Each variety of drake is attuned to a specific element and has psionic control over that element, making its home in areas dominated by its associated element.",
					"Athasian drakes collect objects in their lairs or expand their territory, depending on the individual drake's nature. Although some hoards are valuable, drakes also amass trinkets or souvenirs that have no worth to anyone else. Air drakes maintain multiple lairs atop rocky spires or mesas and divide their few precious belongings among these lairs.",
					"Encounters",
					"Drakes use terrain to their advantage, and the setting for a battle with a drake can be as important as the monster. Precarious cliffs are a great setup for air drakes, volcanic fissures favor fire drakes, and unstable underground burrows make tricky settings for encounters with earth drakes. Water drakes might appear anywhere precious reserves of water exist. Any location might also have been booby-trapped or fortified before the drake claimed it.",
					"Info",
					"The prisoner pleads for the halfling shamans to release him, yet they insist he is a sacrifice to the god of fire. As if answering their call, a creature arises from the crater, magma dripping from its thick, rocky scales. With a bestial rumble like a laugh, it suddenly slashes, felling and devouring the halflings. Before the victim can give thanks, the beast turns its scorching breath and razor-sharp claws on him. A fire drake opens with breath of elemental fire to scorch as many enemies as possible, moving the fiery zone about the battlefield to herd them. It grabs an enemy and uses it to deflect blows, for fun as well as defense. Fire drakes thrive on tormenting their victims, using blazing pain to amplify suffering."

Looking back to the other wagons, they watch in awe as people and kanks rise into the air, suspended by an unseen force, then plummet into the rocky depths. From midair bursts a monster amid a flurry of raking claws and buffeting winds. Air drakes are ambush predators that prefer to tenderize their food by dropping it from a great height. They commonly attack creatures traveling along dangerous precipices. A drake sails in surrounded by its wind veil and rips at its target, then buffets the victim with a blast of wind to force it over the edge.

Her companions turn to run but, with a resounding boom, a mass of soil and stone coalesces around them and engulfs them. These beasts like to play with their food and prefer a meal that puts up a fight before the kill-they might provoke attacks just for the chance to lash out against the attacker. A drake bowls over as many targets as possible with its orb of elemental earth, growing to immense size to intimidate and torment immobilized prey."

					"The dragonborn were born from the mad genius of the sorcerer-king Dregoth, ruler of the former city-state of GiustenaL He created the race to serve him but deemed the result imperfect, so the capricious sorcerer cast the dray out into the sands ofAthas in scorn. A few were allowed to stay in Giustenal, but when the other sorcerer-kings banded together to slay Dregoth, those dray that remained either were killed or barely escaped.",
					"Dragonborn are now extremely rare and band together in small tribes for survival. All that most know of their origin is that their creator tossed them aside, and none are aware that Dregoth persists in a state of undeath.",
					"Among the few people who know of their existence, dragonborn have a reputation as slavers and sorcerers. Though not true ofall their kind, this reputation is well deserved. Many dray use the cruelty of their origin as a justification for slavery-they once belonged to Dregoth, and now they take slaves of their own. Others follow the path of the defiler, caring little for the preservation ofAthas in the pursuit ofever more power.",

					"Hostile dragonborn are slavers and mercenaries. They can be found alongside anyone who pays them enough. Dragonborn respect the strong, and their bands might include other tough humanoids and dangerous beasts.",

A dragon born atavist plunges boldly into the midst of its foes. Then it rips into adversaries with tooth and claw, emulating the fury of the dragon it reveres."

					"Dune stalkers are creatures native to the Elemental Plane of Earth",
					"though they are also frequently found on the Gray Waste of Hades. These monsters revel in evil and take their only joy from spreading its blight. They despise the Material Plane and avoid it as much as possible. Even so, they are sometimes summoned there by evil characters to kill targets or carry out other quests.",
					"Lore",
					"A dune stalker appears humanoid. It stands approximately 7 feet tall, but it would be taller if stretched out or forced to stand erect. Its head is triangular, and the neck attaches near the top of the head, causing its leering, toothy face and pointed chin to hang below its shoulders. The dune stalker's gangly body is hairless, and its red, dusty, abrasive skin has no pores. The combination of short legs, long arms, and stooped posture causes its hands to drag on the ground. Its fingers and toes (four on each limb) are long and bony. The creature has massive shoulders and an enormous chest, which tapers to a narrow waist and hips. A dune stalker that has been assigned a mission by its summoner pursues the literal fulfillment of its instructions to the exclusion of all else. It resents its time on the Material Plane and wants to make its stay there as short as possible. Occasionally, a summoner's instructions are phrased in such a way that the dune stalker cannot actually carry them out. In this case, it is trapped on the Material Plane, where it takes out its frustration by killing all creatures it finds. Despite their sonic abilities, dune stalkers do not speak, though they understand Common and Terran.",
					"Encounters",
					"A dune stalker's preferred tactic is to hide in a rocky area and attack from ambush. When possible, it tries to gain higher ground on its opponents by climbing up on a rock or a structure to conceal itself. It often begins an assault by using its shout ability to disorient a group of opponents, then leaping into combat to deliver its kiss of death. Against foes within its reach, a dune stalker usually prefers to deliver a kiss of death against just one target rather than a shout against the whole group. The preferred target is the one it seeks to slay, or the one that presents the greatest danger, or the one that appears to have the strongest good alignment. (Given the dune stalker's demented psychology, this last could be just about anyone, but paladins usually stand out.)"

					"Weirds are cryptic beings of elemental force who are powerful in the art of divination. They are oracles, soothsayers, and seers of knowledge past, present, and future. Each weird is composed of material from one of the four elements (air, earth, fire, or water) and has special knowledge of the particular aspect of fate with which its element is associated (see below). These creatures dwell in remote or hidden locations on the Material Plane a fact that makes travel difficult for those seeking their counsel. The upper body of a weird always resembles that of a beautiful female humanoid. The lower half may be either humanoid or a serpentine column. A weird rises from a pool of the appropriate element, which it can never leave.",

Like most seers, an elemental weird never provides a clear, concise prophecy. Some of the message may seem forthright, but some is always confusing or just difficult to decipher because the listener does not have enough information to understand the weird's meaning. Though its messages can be misinterpreted, a weird's warnings and advice are never wrong. Its counsel is seldom free, however, so anyone beseeching a weird had best bring offerings or be prepared to undertake a quest of vital importance to the creature.",
					"Encounter",
					"All weirds, regardless of their elemental subtypes, are connected to each other in fundamental ways. They share a unique, secret bond that is evidenced in their level of cooperation. A weird that cannot provide the desired knowledge to a supplicant usually guides him or her to another weird for better counsel. Weirds of different elements often place their pools close to one another to broaden the range of divination services available to supplicants in an area. Weirds are strongly linked to the Material Plane. They have all chosen to leave their native planes and serve as diviners for the humanoid races. Though they are bound to their pools, weirds can interact with other races though mortal agents that specialize in divination magic.",
					"Elemental weirds do not fight if they can avoid it. If they must fight, they begin by summoning elementals to defend them. If any other elementals are present (regardless of type), the weird attempts to gain control of them and turn them against its foes. Meanwhile, the weird remains in the center of its pool, using divination magic to foresee possible consequences of the battle and acting accordingly. If forced into melee, a weird uses its reach to lash out at nearby foes. If seriously threatened, a weird retreats back to its plane of origin.",
					"Elemental Pool",
					"Each weird dwells within a large pool (at least 20 feet across and 40 feet deep) filled with the purest form of its element. The pool is always secured to a flat surface (floor, wall, or ceiling; see individual entries for possible orientations) such that its depth forms a hollow within that surface. The surface must have sufficient depth to accommodate the pool. An elemental pool can also exist as a separate area inside a larger volume of the same element; for example, a water weird's pool might be situated at the bottom of an ocean or lake. The base of the pool contains a portal to the weird's native plane. Creatures granted access to the pool by the weird must provide their own protection from the elemental material, as well as the means to breathe and move within that enviroment. Otherwise, they suffer the effects given in the individual entry. A weird is physically tied to its pool and cannot leave except to return to its native plane through the portal. A weird may rise up to a height of 10 feet above the surface of its pool, but the lower part of its body must always remain in contact with the elemental material. Once a weird exits the pool for its native plane, the portal closes, and the pool loses its special effects. Air Pool. An air weird's pool is filled with billowing, gusting vapors of breathable air and mist. Creatures without the ability to fly cannot move through it, except by falling. An air weird's pool may be affixed to any vertical or horizontal surface, and it may be right side up or upside down (if affixed to a ceiling, for example). Fire Pool. This pool contains a torrent of dancing flames that burn and smoke continually. Unprotected flammable materials within a fire pool catch on fire immediately, and any creature within the pool takes 3d10 fire damage per round. Creatures without the ability to fly cannot move through this pool, except by falling. A fire weird's pool may be affixed to any vertical or horizontal surface, and it may appear only in a right side up position (such as on the floor of a cavern). Earth Pool. This pool is filled with churning mud, rocks, and earth. Every creature within it (except the earth weird and earth elementals) takes 4d8 bludgeonning damage per round from the ever-grinding earth. In addition, creatures entering the pool suffocate if they do not have a way to breathe and are entombed (restrained) if they cannot burrow. An earth weird's pool may be affixed only to a horizontal surface, and it may appear only in a right side up position (such as in the floor of a cavern). Water Pool. This pool is filled with bubbling, swirling water. Any creature within it that cannot breathe water immediately begins to drown. Any creature without the ability to swim cannot move through a water pool, except by falling. A water weird's pool may be affixed only to a horizontal surface, and it may appear only in a right side up position (such as on the floor of a cavern).",
					"Info",
					"Air weirds are elemental spirits that offer direction and guidance to those traveling into unknown areas. They can point out paths not considered, reveal unknown doors into new worlds, and describe what may be needed to survive such journeys. An air weird's pool is often found outside, in an open-air place such as a windy plain or on a mountaintop. An air weird appears as a ghostly, translucent woman composed of flowing vapors. Its eyes are deep blue, and its hair appears windblown. The lower half of the creature's body is a tendril of mist that trails back into its pool."

					"Weirds are cryptic beings of elemental force who are powerful in the art of divination. They are oracles, soothsayers, and seers of knowledge past, present, and future. Each weird is composed of material from one of the four elements (air, earth, fire, or water) and has special knowledge of the particular aspect of fate with which its element is associated (see below). These creatures dwell in remote or hidden locations on the Material Plane a fact that makes travel difficult for those seeking their counsel. The upper body of a weird always resembles that of a beautiful female humanoid. The lower half may be either humanoid or a serpentine column. A weird rises from a pool of the appropriate element, which it can never leave.",
					"A weird can divine information that could change the very course of history. It has its finger on the pulse of fate and knows exactly where possible courses of action might lead. Like most seers, an elemental weird never provides a clear, concise prophecy. Some of the message may seem forthright, but some is always confusing or just difficult to decipher because the listener does not have enough information to understand the weird's meaning. Though its messages can be misinterpreted, a weird's warnings and advice are never wrong. Its counsel is seldom free, however, so anyone beseeching a weird had best bring offerings or be prepared to undertake a quest of vital importance to the creature.",
					"Encounter",
					"All weirds, regardless of their elemental subtypes, are connected to each other in fundamental ways. They share a unique, secret bond that is evidenced in their level of cooperation. A weird that cannot provide the desired knowledge to a supplicant usually guides him or her to another weird for better counsel. Weirds of different elements often place their pools close to one another to broaden the range of divination services available to supplicants in an area. Weirds are strongly linked to the Material Plane. They have all chosen to leave their native planes and serve as diviners for the humanoid races. Though they are bound to their pools, weirds can interact with other races though mortal agents that specialize in divination magic.",
					"Elemental weirds do not fight if they can avoid it. If they must fight, they begin by summoning elementals to defend them. If any other elementals are present (regardless of type), the weird attempts to gain control of them and turn them against its foes. Meanwhile, the weird remains in the center of its pool, using divination magic to foresee possible consequences of the battle and acting accordingly. If forced into melee, a weird uses its reach to lash out at nearby foes. If seriously threatened, a weird retreats back to its plane of origin.",
					"Elemental Pool",
					"Each weird dwells within a large pool (at least 20 feet across and 40 feet deep) filled with the purest form of its element. The pool is always secured to a flat surface (floor, wall, or ceiling; see individual entries for possible orientations) such that its depth forms a hollow within that surface. The surface must have sufficient depth to accommodate the pool. An elemental pool can also exist as a separate area inside a larger volume of the same element; for example, a water weird's pool might be situated at the bottom of an ocean or lake. The base of the pool contains a portal to the weird's native plane. Creatures granted access to the pool by the weird must provide their own protection from the elemental material, as well as the means to breathe and move within that enviroment. Otherwise, they suffer the effects given in the individual entry. A weird is physically tied to its pool and cannot leave except to return to its native plane through the portal. A weird may rise up to a height of 10 feet above the surface of its pool, but the lower part of its body must always remain in contact with the elemental material. Once a weird exits the pool for its native plane, the portal closes, and the pool loses its special effects. Air Pool. An air weird's pool is filled with billowing, gusting vapors of breathable air and mist. Creatures without the ability to fly cannot move through it, except by falling. An air weird's pool may be affixed to any vertical or horizontal surface, and it may be right side up or upside down (if affixed to a ceiling, for example). Fire Pool. This pool contains a torrent of dancing flames that burn and smoke continually. Unprotected flammable materials within a fire pool catch on fire immediately, and any creature within the pool takes 3d10 fire damage per round. Creatures without the ability to fly cannot move through this pool, except by falling. A fire weird's pool may be affixed to any vertical or horizontal surface, and it may appear only in a right side up position (such as on the floor of a cavern). Earth Pool. This pool is filled with churning mud, rocks, and earth. Every creature within it (except the earth weird and earth elementals) takes 4d8 bludgeonning damage per round from the ever-grinding earth. In addition, creatures entering the pool suffocate if they do not have a way to breathe and are entombed (restrained) if they cannot burrow. An earth weird's pool may be affixed only to a horizontal surface, and it may appear only in a right side up position (such as in the floor of a cavern). Water Pool. This pool is filled with bubbling, swirling water. Any creature within it that cannot breathe water immediately begins to drown. Any creature without the ability to swim cannot move through a water pool, except by falling. A water weird's pool may be affixed only to a horizontal surface, and it may appear only in a right side up position (such as on the floor of a cavern).",
					"Info",
					"Fire weirds are the diviners of hope. They shed light when all is dark and illuminate lore that has been long lost and nearly forgotten. They guide the long-suffering and ignorant to new peace and prosperity. The beautiful, feminine half of a fire weird is a humanoid form composed of flickering flames and wreathed with smoke. The lower half of the body snakes away in a fiery trail into the hazy, flame-filled pool."

					"Erdlus are large flightless, featherless birds covered with flaky scales that range in color from pale gray to deep red. An erdlu can weigh as much as 200 pounds and grow to a height of 7 feet. Its massive, round body has a pair of useless wings that fold in at its sides. A snakelike neck rises to a small round head with a huge, wedge-shaped beak. A pair of powerful, lanky legs extend down from the body and end in four-toed, razor-clawed feet.",
					"Erdlus make ideal herd animals because of their temperaments and ability to survive on a variety of foods. They can eat many forms of tough vegetation, as well as snakes, reptiles, and insects. The eggs that erdlus provide are an excellent source of nutrition. A diet of erdlu eggs can keep a human or demihuman alive for months at a time, for the eggs are packed with a variety of nutrients and essential vitamins. If an erdlu egg is eaten raw, it is a substitute for one gallon of water. However, this substitution is not perfect and can only be used successfully for no more than one week. The meat of an erdlu also makes an excellent meal.",
					"In groups, erdlus instinctively flock together for protection. If threatened, these creatures usually flee. For short distances of no more than half a mile, erdlus can race along at great speeds (50 feet). Their normal walking pace is much slower (30 feet). When escape is not possible, the flock turns and fights as a group. They strike first with sharp beaks (inflicting 1d6 points of damage) then rake with one of their claws (causing 1d4 points of damage).",
					"The hard scales of an erdlu's wings can be fashioned into shields or even armor (with an AC of 6), its beak can be used to make fine spearheads, and its claws can be crafted into daggers or tools."

					"Lore",
					"A grisgol is a horrifying construct composed of broken and worn-out magic items, animated by a powerful spellcaster who has harnessed the spirit of a lich. Its skeleton is fabricated from old staffs and wands and its skin from expended scrolls wrapped about it like a mummy's burial cloth. Woven into this are rings, bracers, fragments of leather or chainmail, and the like. Inside the creature are scores of half-empty vials of potions, unguents, and oils, vaguely resembling sets of internal organs. It typically wears a rune-scribed cloak or robe. Pinpoints of red light glare from underneath a hood or old helmet. Nestled inside the construct, among miscellaneous junk, is the original lich's phylactery. Unless one knows what animates a grisgol, the phylactery appears as another piece of spent magic trash tossed loosely and randomly into the insides of the construct. From a distance, a grisgol appears to be a mummy, even moving with a similar stiff gait. When it walks, one can hear the tinkling of glass touching glass, the sloshing of half-filled vials and bottles, the squeaking of leather, the rubbing of wood and bone against each other, and, most prominently, the shuffl ing of paper as if pages of a tome were caught in a slight breeze. Thin tendrils of black smoke escape from cracks in its body. A grisgol leaves a sooty, oily residue upon whatever it touches. A grisgol is in every way a magic construct, possessing all traits native to golems in addition to the abilities of the lich that powers it. A grisgol's damaging and paralyzing touch attacks are the same as a lich and the construct retains a fraction of the original lich's spell-casting ability. A grisgol only casts the spells scribed by its creator on the scrolls and tome pages that make up its outer skin.",
					"The spells a grisgol can cast are, however, restricted to the spell levels, domains, and specializations the lich (a 20th-level cleric, sorcerer, or wizard) could have cast. Destroying a grisgol does not destroy the lich that powers it. To kill the lich, its phylactery must be destroyed after the grisgol is destroyed. Otherwise, the lich is free to return in a physical form in 1d10 days. The escaped lich retains all the powers and abilities it had previous to its entrapment. The lich seeks vengeance upon whoever possesses its phylactery and the wizard, sorcerer, or cleric who originally entrapped it in the body of a grisgol. A grisgol stands 8 feet tall and weighs about 400 pounds. It knows all the languages known by the lich whose phylactery animates it.",
					"Encounters",
					"Grisgol are rare, even by golem standards. They are solitary construct that exist solely to serve the will of their master. Once this master has died it continues to fulfil his duty, oblivious of the pointless reason behind it. In the region of Raam, particularly ancient tombs are rumored to hold mysterious string of parchment, driving those reading them to madness and death. Other reports from adventurers tell the stories of strange mummies invulnerable to most of their known weaknesses.",
					"Lich sometimes create grisgol as punishment for their rivals, hiding their phylactery in the construct and sending them to impossible and pointless mission. They are reveling in the knowledge that their enemy can do nothing but rage silently while his immortality is wasted away."

Whether patrolling halfling lands or wandering the wastes, they harry enemies rather than engaging them in pitched battles. Fierce warriors, forest runners do not fear enemies even two or three times their size. They rely on stealth, poison, teamwork, and pure savagery to defeat their foes. They favor moving up to their enemies and then using strike and slip away to vanish back into the surrounding terrain."

					"As harsh and unyielding as their desert homes, harssafs don't typically deal congenially with others. Harssafs live in and wander the great deserts and barren places of Athas. Seemingly composed of the fire and sand of their home terrain, they live in nomadic bands and frequently raid settlements within or near their homes. Harssafs live mostly insular lives, traveling and raiding throughout a massive section of the Tableland, the Great Aluvial Sand Wastes and the Endless Sand Dunes. Harssafs have no compunctions about killing when necessary, but they take no particular pride in it. Killing to the harssafs is a necessary skill to survive the coming sandstorms that will carry the great desert to the far reaches of the world. Both male and female harssafs stand about 6 feet tall and weigh about 190 pounds. Harssaf communities dot the great deserts of Sarlona. When humans migrated from Sarlona to Khorvaire millennia ago, they brought harssaf slaves with them. Their descendants gather in small tribes in the heart of the Talenta Plains, where the harssafs maintain a tenuous truce with roaming halfling plainsfolk. The halflings of the Talenta Plains refer to these harssaf \"interlopers\" as the Flameborn.",
					"Harssaf clans are incredibly structured, composed of a strict caste system of scouts and tenders. Tenders comprise less than one-third of a band's total population, and even they are capable warriors. Consisting mostly of scouts incapable of fighting due to age or infirmity, pregnant females, young children, and the few craftsfolk of the clan, tenders are regarded as second-class citizens. Leaders of the clans always emerge from the scout caste, which consists of any male or female of fighting age. Males and females have an equal opportunity to prove themselves worthy of the scout caste. But females who have children are relegated to be tenders until their children are old enough to be left with others of the caste. Only then can these females return to the scout clan. As a result, children are raised by the clan as a whole, being alternately schooled by different members of the scout caste. These scouts have taken it upon themselves to educate the youngsters in various martial and religious mysteries to ensure they are prepared to choose their career when they come of age.",
					"Encounter",
					"Harssaf clans sometimes skirmish over resources or territory, but they prefer to avoid fighting other chosen desert dwellers and focus their raids on the soft outlanders. A harssaf camp is usually composed of several small tents shared by tenders, and a few large pavilions where the scouts stay. Due to their natural affinity for hot and sandy environments, harssafs have no problem sleeping in the open desert. Rumors exist of ancient harssaf structures in the deepest deserts, strongholds that all clans visit from time to time. These strongholds are said to hold the history of the mysterious harssaf people, as well as monasteries that devote themselves to schooling the many monks of the harssaf clans.",
					"Info",
					"A harssaf prefers to ambush its opponents, hiding among the dunes near the desert edge in sand form or just beneath the sands and using its blindsense to determine when potential targets wander by. Once engaged in melee, a harssaf ignites its weapons and closes to melee, wielding its twin kukris with deadly efficiency."

					"As harsh and unyielding as their desert homes, harssafs don't typically deal congenially with others. Harssafs live in and wander the great deserts and barren places of Athas. Seemingly composed of the fire and sand of their home terrain, they live in nomadic bands and frequently raid settlements within or near their homes. Harssafs live mostly insular lives, traveling and raiding throughout a massive section of the Tableland, the Great Aluvial Sand Wastes and the Endless Sand Dunes. Harssafs have no compunctions about killing when necessary, but they take no particular pride in it. Killing to the harssafs is a necessary skill to survive the coming sandstorms that will carry the great desert to the far reaches of the world. Both male and female harssafs stand about 6 feet tall and weigh about 190 pounds. Harssaf communities dot the great deserts of Sarlona. When humans migrated from Sarlona to Khorvaire millennia ago, they brought harssaf slaves with them. Their descendants gather in small tribes in the heart of the Talenta Plains, where the harssafs maintain a tenuous truce with roaming halfling plainsfolk. The halflings of the Talenta Plains refer to these harssaf \"interlopers\" as the Flameborn.",
					"Harssaf clans are incredibly structured, composed of a strict caste system of scouts and tenders. Tenders comprise less than one-third of a band's total population, and even they are capable warriors. Consisting mostly of scouts incapable of fighting due to age or infirmity, pregnant females, young children, and the few craftsfolk of the clan, tenders are regarded as second-class citizens. Leaders of the clans always emerge from the scout caste, which consists of any male or female of fighting age. Males and females have an equal opportunity to prove themselves worthy of the scout caste. But females who have children are relegated to be tenders until their children are old enough to be left with others of the caste. Only then can these females return to the scout clan. As a result, children are raised by the clan as a whole, being alternately schooled by different members of the scout caste. These scouts have taken it upon themselves to educate the youngsters in various martial and religious mysteries to ensure they are prepared to choose their career when they come of age.",

					"Harssaf clans sometimes skirmish over resources or territory, but they prefer to avoid fighting other chosen desert dwellers and focus their raids on the soft outlanders. A harssaf camp is usually composed of several small tents shared by tenders, and a few large pavilions where the scouts stay. Due to their natural affinity for hot and sandy environments, harssafs have no problem sleeping in the open desert. Rumors exist of ancient harssaf structures in the deepest deserts, strongholds that all clans visit from time to time. These strongholds are said to hold the history of the mysterious harssaf people, as well as monasteries that devote themselves to schooling the many monks of the harssaf clans.",

Hejkins are cursed to see beyond the world into a heaving, squirming space filled with nightmares. They draw power from this place and from the twisted primal spirits of the blasted Athasian land. These diminutive creatures might appear to be crazed monsters, but they have a rudimentary culture. They revere the earth and its dark spirits as terrifying and callous forces that nonetheless supply life. Their connection to the earth gives hejkins a hatred of creatures that misuse arcane magic or carve into the earth. They murder spellcasters and miners with glee, taking meat, supplies, and other spoils to their hidden abodes. No creature is safe from the cook fires of hejkins, even other hejkins. The creatures also covet treasure. As long as they don't have to scar the earth to acquire their spoils, they collect gems and gold.",
					"Lore",
					"Hejkins are deformed in both body and mind. They gibber and behave erratically, occasionally engaging in elaborate alien rites to unnamable spirits. They prefer to raid at night and return to their caverns during the day. Hejkins make their homes in natural caverns, choosing those with an existing water supply. They do not shape earth or stone. The only marks the hejkins leave are strange, charged runes on cave walls. These runes hold power that can harm the unwary or drive the sane to madness.",
					"Hunger or bloodlust draws hejkins from their caverns. Astronomical events, such as a comet's appearance in the sky, can drive hejkin tribes into a frenzy. During these times, they are found in nearly any kind of environment, murdering and plundering.",

					"Hejkin serve unknown entities that drives them insane, during a crisis or a particularly intense twisted rite the hejkins scribble glyphs on the rock, granting magical powers to the ugly symbol. Most of these glyphs merely duplicate the effect of a glyph of warding spell. Each glyph is a unique glyph with specific effects. Master glyphs affect a creature upon its initial entry into the glyph's range. Beneficial glyphs apply their effects immediately. Hostile glyphs typically grant a saving throw to negate or reduce their effects; in this case, a creature need only make the save upon entering the glyph's range. The effect of a glyph ends immediately after a creature leaves the glyph's area of effect, but the creature must make a new saving throw immediately upon reentering the glyph's range. The effects of multiple glyphs do not stack. In a case where more than one glyph would have an effect on a specific area, the glyph with the highest spell level suppresses the other glyphs. In the case of multiple glyphs of the same spell level overlapping, the most recently created glyph suppresses the older glyphs.",

The effect of this glyph persists for 1 minute after a creature exits the area of effect. A successful DC 13 Wisdom saving throw negates the effect completely.",
					"Glyph of Twisted Reality: Squirming, ebony tentacles fill a 20-foot square on ground and walls around the glyph. These tentacles turn the ground in the area into difficult terrain. When a creature enters the affected area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or take 3d6 bludgeoning damage and be restrained by the tentacles. A creature that starts its turn in the area and is already restrained by the tentacles takes 3d6 bludgeoning damage. A creature restrained by the tentacles can use its action to make a Strength or Dexterity check (its choice) against a DC 14. On a success, it frees itself.",

					"Glyph of Madness: All creatures within 30 feet of this glyph hear the raving of mad voices in their mind, all nonaberration within range must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or become charmed for the duration. While a creature is charmed in this way, a madness glows in its eyes. The charmed creature must use its action before moving on each of its turns to make a melee attack against a creature other than itself. The target can act normally on its turn if you choose no creature or if none are within its reach. An affected creature can retake the Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a success, it's free from the glyph's influence until it enters the area of effect again.",
					"Glyph of the Deep Curse: Within 30 feet of this glyph, any nonaberration must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or become diseased. The disease has no effect for one minute and can be removed by any magic that cures disease. After 1 minute, the diseased creature's skin becomes grey, slimy, and skin lesion start to appear. The creature can't regain hit points unless it is underground, and the disease can be removed only by heal or another disease-curing spell of 6th level or higher. When the creature is outside in the open, it takes 6 (1d12) acid damage every 10 minutes.",

					"The rampant misuse of arcane power",
					"not only altered Athas's environs, it also birthed numerous abominations. Among these monsters are the burrowing humanoids called hejkins. Hejkins are cursed to see beyond the world into a heaving, squirming space filled with nightmares. They draw power from this place and from the twisted primal spirits of the blasted Athasian land. These diminutive creatures might appear to be crazed monsters, but they have a rudimentary culture. They revere the earth and its dark spirits as terrifying and callous forces that nonetheless supply life. Their connection to the earth gives hejkins a hatred of creatures that misuse arcane magic or carve into the earth. They murder spellcasters and miners with glee, taking meat, supplies, and other spoils to their hidden abodes. No creature is safe from the cook fires of hejkins, even other hejkins. The creatures also covet treasure. As long as they don't have to scar the earth to acquire their spoils, they collect gems and gold.",
					"Lore",
					"Hejkins are deformed in both body and mind. They gibber and behave erratically, occasionally engaging in elaborate alien rites to unnamable spirits. They prefer to raid at night and return to their caverns during the day. Hejkins make their homes in natural caverns, choosing those with an existing water supply. They do not shape earth or stone. The only marks the hejkins leave are strange, charged runes on cave walls. These runes hold power that can harm the unwary or drive the sane to madness.",
					"Hunger or bloodlust draws hejkins from their caverns. Astronomical events, such as a comet's appearance in the sky, can drive hejkin tribes into a frenzy. During these times, they are found in nearly any kind of environment, murdering and plundering.",
					"Master glyphs",
					"Hejkin serve unknown entities that drives them insane, during a crisis or a particularly intense twisted rite the hejkins scribble glyphs on the rock, granting magical powers to the ugly symbol. Most of these glyphs merely duplicate the effect of a glyph of warding spell. Each glyph is a unique glyph with specific effects. Master glyphs affect a creature upon its initial entry into the glyph's range. Beneficial glyphs apply their effects immediately. Hostile glyphs typically grant a saving throw to negate or reduce their effects; in this case, a creature need only make the save upon entering the glyph's range. The effect of a glyph ends immediately after a creature leaves the glyph's area of effect, but the creature must make a new saving throw immediately upon reentering the glyph's range. The effects of multiple glyphs do not stack. In a case where more than one glyph would have an effect on a specific area, the glyph with the highest spell level suppresses the other glyphs.

					"Kanks are large docile insects often used as mounts by the people of the Tablelands. A black exoskeleton of chitin covers their segmented bodies. The three body sections are the head, thorax, and abdomen. They weigh as much as 400 pounds, grow to heights of 4 feet at the back, and as long as 8 feet from head to abdomen. Around their mouths, they have multi-jointed pincers that they can use to carry objects, feed themselves, or fight. Six lanky legs descend from their thoraxes. Each ends in a single flexible claw that allows them to grip the surfaces they walk upon.",
					"Kanks are often used as caravan mounts. They can travel a full day at their top speed, carrying a 200-pound passenger and 200 pounds of cargo. Kanks make decent herd animals, but usually only elves employ them as such. As kanks can digest almost any sort of organic matter, they can thrive in most terrain types. In addition, these creatures require little special attention. A kank hive instinctively organizes itself into food producers, soldiers, and brood queens."

					"The kirre is one of the more vicious animals of the forests and jungles of Athas. Resembling a tiger in many ways, the kirre is a beast not to be trifled with.",
					"At first glance, the kirre looks like a great cat, but upon closer examination, the differences quickly become clear. The kirre is eight feet in length and has eight legs, each ending in paws that sport very sharp claws. The kirre also has large horns on either sides of its head and a sharp barbed tail spike often used as a weapon. The mouth of the kirre is large and has sharp, canine teeth, which are used mostly for tearing food that has been killed. The kirre is a fur-covered animal with coloration similar to a tiger (both are striped). However, where a tiger are is striped in black and orange, the kirre is striped in brown and grey. This coloration is consistent all over the kirre's body, with the exception of its face, which is all grey.",
					"Kirres are normally solitary creatures, until the approach of their mating season, at which time a male and female will join and produce offspring. Kirre litters number from three to five young. Kirres are mammals, and females produce milk for their young. Young kirres survive on milk for the first five months, at which point they begin to eat solid food such as small forest animals and other mammals.",
					"Kirre are a favorite game of many hunting tribes of races who live in the forests of Athas. The meat from kirres is some of the finest on all of Athas, and many seek after it. Aside from a source of food, the kirre also has other uses when killed. The creature's horns can be cut off and used as spearheads; in some cases, they can be carved into ornate daggers. In addition, the tail of a kirre has a sharp, bone spike at its end that can be fashioned into either an arrowhead or a dart."

					"Megapedes are colossal centipedes that roam the sandy deserts of Athas. Megapedes are very similar to normal centipedes in all ways except in size. They have a very long (100 to 150 feet), segmented body which sports a pair of legs nearly every two feet. These legs are five feet in length and have flexible claws at their ends. The body of a megapede is covered with a fur-covered, bulbous skin that serves as a pseudo-exoskeleton.",
					"The megapedes of Athas are, with the exceptions of the Dragon and Nightmare Beasts, the most dangerous feature of travelling across the deserts of this harsh world.",
					"Because of their sheer size, megapedes cannot normally hide their presence. Most, however, live beneath the sands of the desert, only surfacing to feed on unfortunate passers-by. Herds of erdlus and even kanks are among the favorite foods of megapedes, though they often survive on vegetation alone for weeks on end.",
					"A Megapede's Lair",
					"When a megapede is ready to lay eggs, it will find an isolated area, if possible in the rocky barrens of the Tablelands, and begin to make a cocoon in which to place its eggs. Up to three eggs can be placed within one cocoon, which often reaches near 60 feet in length. A cocoon will remain for four to five weeks before bearing young megapedes. At birth, a megapede is 20 to 30 feet long, growing to its full size within three months after birth. While not especially protective of its cocoon, a megapede, which has laid eggs, will fight off any creature that threatens them, mostly out of instinct."

					"Long before luckless travelers in more remote and foreboding marshes see the harrowing sight of a lone night twist, they hear its haunting and melancholy song. The ghostly moaning sounds of its song seem slightly different to every traveler. For some, the song of the night twist sounds like a women weeping. To others, it is more akin to a wind blowing over a desolate graveyard. Most likely, the despair song of a night twist is the most sorrowful sound each traveler can conjurer within his or her own mind. Night twists subsist in the most inhospitable marshes, mudflats and ruins feeding on the rotting carcasses of creatures and travelers attracted by its despair song.",

These night twists watch over the unplundered tombs, buried deep in the land in ancient times. Much older night twists can be found throughout the Dry Marsh and the Crescent Forest, taking root in and around the cyclopean ruins of fallen giant cities, their songs of despair luring explorers to a swift doom.",
					"A night twist, when actively seeking victims, sends out its despair song in order to bring prey to it. When those lured by the song are within range, a night twist uses its phantasmal killer spell-like ability. A night twist employs its powerful slam attack only if opponents first survive the illusion. The creature uses its entangle and darkness spell-like abilities to keep opponents from escaping. When a night twist feels threatened, it uses its wind attack and fear spelllike ability."

Each nightmare beast was once another, more mundane predator of the wastelands. In rare instances, as an animal consumes prey within areas connected to the Gray or imbued with substantial defiling magic, the creature slowly begins to change. Energy courses through it, causing it to grow and to develop a limitless hatred for all living things. Once the tainted creature begins to seek and consume sentient beings, it mutates into a nightmare beast.",
					"Nightmare beast spawn aren't progeny - they are a stage of mutation that some creatures reach before full metamorphosis is achieved.",
					"This, of course, leads to other questions: Why do these creatures all mutate into the same form? Do other, related mutations haunt the farthest reaches of the wastes?",
					"Info",
					"A maw of gladius-sized teeth splits a hulking form covered in armored scales. Tusks as sharp and numerous as the spears of a phalanx sprout from this opening. A nightmare beast stands at least 20 feet tall on its four legs. Each of its digits is tipped with a 3-foot-long claw. Its jaws are filled with 1-foot-long teeth and flanked by curved tusks the size of cavalry lances. A nightmare beast's thick, tough hide is typically dark gray with dark blue, purple, or brown splotches in between patches of bony material. Its red eyes, each the size of a man's head, glow in the dark. The nightmare beast prefers to lair in a remote cave. It spends most of its time in search of food, and it tends to hunt in one area until the food supply is exhausted. At that point, it usually hibernates for up to one year, then awakens again in a ravenous state. Surely nothing so nightmarish could be a living being-and yet it is. The nightmare beast is always ravenous, a mobile source of carnage. The more the beast's hunger is frustrated, the greater the frenzy of its attacks.",
					"Hatred consumes a nightmare beast - only through supreme willpower does it resist its brutish impulses. When possessed of its full faculties, the beast torments its enemies, sending them into nightmare-filled slumber. While its victim thrashes, the beast appears at its side where it can sample the horror firsthand. If a nightmare beast becomes injured, all thought of toying with its enemies vanishes. Its barely contained monstrous nature surges to the fore. Roaring with rage, it rises up on its hind legs, savagely slashing, impaling, and destroying its enemies. The putrid essence of a nightmare beast taints everything around it when the beast dies. At the Dungeon Master's option, the area within 30ft of a slain nightmare beast becomes defiled terrain."

					"Fallen Sphinxes, whether through the weariness of the ages, corrupted by the slaughter of innocents, or dreams of worship by supplicants that attempt to bargain their way to knowledge, protosphinxes broke free of their divine command. Once freed of their servitude to the forgotten gods of Athas many sphinxs became protosphinx, abandoning their divine mission to become above all else, aggressive and animalistic creatures who lives up to the vicious reputation of their patron animal, the large and violent crocodile.",
					"However, even if a sphinx's alignment and loyalties drift in this way, it never leaves the place it guards or grants its secrets to any except creatures it deem's worthy. Despite their feral appearances and their obvious cruelty protosphinxes are clever manipulators that still obey to old divine laws. They follow the tradition of magical tests, expecting the failure of the contestant and an easy meal. However, they always make sure that one of them escape alive so the tell of their buried treasure keeps spreading and food keeps coming.",
					"In some reagions of the desert they are seen as cruel but benevolent patron, protecting a community and helping it prosper with its magic in exchange of frequent and bloody sacrifices.",
					"Some protosphinx are plainly mad, vicious creatures that do not obey any of their specie's dogma. These sphinxes are the ones that have been played by explorers and adventurers, cheated of their treasure or secrets in a deceitful way. They succumb to madness without the support of their deity and quickly after transform into a protosphinx, only driven by vengeance. The only way to appease the monster is to retrieve its treasure or to make sure its secret is safe once again.",
					"Encounter",
					"Protosphinxes can be found all over Athas, guarding forgotten temples where no worship has been uttered in millenias, watching over treasure rooms in lost cities. The Tablelands are famous for the high number of ruins that can be found there, and therefor protosphinxes are more common in this region. The south of the Great Alluvial Sand Wastes, getween the Giant's Ribs Mountains and the Screaming Ravine is known to be the home of at least two of this monstrosity, but none has been brave enough to follow the creatures to their lair and discover what could have spawn two of them.",
					"The most famous of the protosphinx is certainly Munakhtmou, lurking in the ruins of Balshara, at the foot of the Black Spine Mountains. Munakhtmou is known to keep no treasure or secret, but instead receive the worship of a growing community of escaped slaves, nomads and sheperds. The sphinx receives the sacrifices of intelligent humanoid and in exchange uses his magic to fertilise the land and defend the community against raiders and slavers."

					"Psurlons are an old race possessing deep lore. They are sometimes sought by masters of the Way, spellcasters, or historians to shed new light on old questions. Getting answers from a psurlon is fraught with danger, though-the exchange can end with the questioner's death if great care is not taken. Psurlons are not native to Athas. They found their way through the Gray; some might still reside in the blasted graveyard of dead gods. They were drawn to Athas like moths to a flame, attracted by the high degree of psionic power regularly wielded by life forms on the planet. Centuries ago, the psurlons had a world all their own. In an act of hubris, they attempted to unite the minds of their race into a single godmind. Disaster struck, and the resulting psychic backlash destroyed the psurlon home world. Only their minds survived, and they managed that only by taking shelter in the Astral Sea and by anchoring themselves in the bodies of mindless slugs. Over thousands of worm generations, the psurIons modified their host forms until they reached their present aberrant embodiments. Although they might once have had forms similar to the humanoids of Athas, they have come to prefer their wormlike host forms.",

If combat is imminent, a psurlon burrows into the most advantageous position, using close or melee attacks to position foes or inhibit their movement. A psurlon might gather humanoid minions under its influence to do its fighting. Warded by these cat's-paws, it dominates weak-willed opponents or focuses its damage on the least armored enemies.",

					"Rakshasas originated long ago in the Nine Hells, when powerful devils created a dark ritual to free their essence from their fiendish bodies in order to escape the Lower Planes. A rakshasa enters the Material Plane to feed its appetite for humanoid flesh and evil schemes. It selects its prey with care, taking pains to keep its presence in the world a secret.",
					"For a rakshasa, death on the Material Plane means an agonizing and torturous return to the Nine Hells, where its essence remains trapped until its body reforms - a process that cart take months or years. When the rakshasa is reborn, it has all the memories and knowledge of its former life, and it seeks retribution against the one who slew it. If the target has somehow slipped through its grasp, the rakshasa might punish its killer's family, friends, or descendants. Like devils, rakshasas killed in the Nine Hells are forever destroyed.",

The master of Roqom is Fajjayad, a great rakshasa prince, and he occasionally uses magical sendings tolure silt sailors and travelers to his black palace especiallytravelers who have a desperate need of some sort. Fajjayad claims to be able to provide for any such needs in exchange for services to be rendered within 1,001 days. The rakshasa is unfailingly polite and candid. If asked, he freely admits that the task he sets is likely to be difficult, even deadly, and that his \"clients\" might die while attempting it. However, Fajjayad assures them that \"the laws\" (a term he does not define) forbid him from setting a task that is impossible or whose outcome is certain death. For his magic to work, the task must have an element of chance and uncertainty. Still, if any group has ever profited from Fajjayad's bargain, its tale is not known.",

Rakshasa society is led by a rajah or maharajah, whose commands are to be obeyed without question. Rakshasas wage war on humanity constantly, not only to feed themselves but because they believe that battle is the only way to gain honor. If confronted by humans who recognize their true appearance, they are insufferably arrogant. A rakshasa's life varies in cycles of wild self-indulgence in times of prosperity and strict fasting and sacrifice in times of trouble or before battle. They are honorable creatures but will twist the wording of an agreement to suit their purposes. They prefer to deal with humanity by using their illusion powers to deceive and manipulate them, but are brave and forthright in battle."

					"Ak'chazar rakshasas wander the planes seeking new lands to subjugate and new undead minions to enslave. These rakshasas are masters of necromantic magic, although they are powerful in the other schools of magic as well. Ak'chazar rakshasas typically work behind the scenes, manipulating events to suit their dark whims and relying on their web of spies, assassins, and intelligent undead to carry out their nefarious plots. Ak'chazar rakshasas do associate with other rakshasas, often as leaders or manipulators. Other types of rakshasas value an ak'chazar's intelligence even as they fear its abilities. It is not uncommon for weaker rakshasas to follow the complex plans of an ak'chazar even as they go about their own missions. All rakshasas tend toward solitary existences, but communication and coordination between the various kinds is not unheard of.",
					"An ak'chazar rakshasa typically establishes a power base at the site of a great battle, a city of the dead, or some other place where a large number of corpses might be interred. It uses its power over undead to create several intelligent undead minions. Thereafter, it might make contact with a local underworld organization (almost always through intermediaries) or even a corrupt or power-hungry political official.",
					"It will play with these leaders, offering them advice, power, or riches as it learns their habits and defining characteristics. Then the ak'chazar uses its magic jar spell-like ability to replace one of these leaders for a time, using the borrowed body to solidify its hold on the region.",
					"Several of the House Tsalaxa high officials are actually ak'chazar rakshasas. They sequester themselves in foreboding strongholds or warehouses hidden in the waste, although some have made lairs closer to the heart of civilization in the city states. At least one ak'chazar rakshasa operates from within Balic, lending his services and undead minions in exchange for special favors too terrible to ponder."

Creature's unfortunate enough to encounter a rampager might spot flitting spirits of fire, sand, stone, or wind assailing the beast, filling it with uncontrollable rage. The spirits cannot be attacked during the encounter, but further chaos might be averted if a way can be found to placate them through offerings or restitution.",

It cannot abide metal's stench and focuses its attacks on enemies wielding metal weapons or wearing metal armor. Once it dispatches these foes, it turns back to structures and rips through walls and buildings until nothing remains. It stops only when it is dead or no artificial object remains intact."

Of course, salt alone is not sufficient to suffuse a body with undead vigor; often, such a creature has taken a great sin with it to its subterranean grave, the horror of which eventually creates a linkage to the Gray. A salt mummy is usually encountered by miners working a new deposit. It appears at first to be nothing more than an old, salt-rimed corpse. If the miners continue to dig it out, eventually the mummy becomes animate and waits until it is almost dug free. The shuddering crack as a salt mummy breaks away from a salt vein is a dreadful thing to hear.",

					"The diminutive silt runner",
					"proves that even the smallest of Athas's creatures are disproportionately deadly. Distantly related to ssurrans (Athas's lizardfolk), silt runners combine greed with cold-blooded ruthlessness. Their xenophobic hatred of other races is renowned. Survivors of attacks by silt runners describe how their companions were swarmed over and gradually lacerated to death by numerous tiny, razor-edged blades - a particularly unpleasant way to perish.",
					"Lore",
					"Silt runners live in tribal warrens, temporary camps spread between dunes and connected by tunnels. They use these bases as staging areas for raiding small communities or slow-moving caravans. As their name implies, silt runners move easily across loose sand and silt, preferring to hunt where the terrain works to their advantage. Silt runners wear the clothes, treasures, and body parts of their victims as trophies. The rest of their prey is consumed. For reasons lost to history - perhaps nothing more than a quirk of biology - these humanoids harbor a particular hatred for fey. They have been known to break off attacks against far more numerous or vulnerable foes to attack a lone elf or eladrin.",
					"Encounters",
					"Battles with silt runners occur in the open desert or within communities on the edges of the wastes. Unless an attacking force is small, silt runners quickly abandon their transitory warrens rather than defend them. The silt runners prefer to retaliate later with a surprise attack. Silt runners prefer the company of their own kind. On occasion, a tribe cooperates with reptilian creatures such as ssurrans or dray. Some tribes tame lizards as beasts of war.",
					"Info",
					"Scurrying about the periphery of a battle or lurking behind rolling dunes, darters skim across the sand on broad, webbed feet. They keep careful watch for the right moment to launch their stinging projectiles into an enemy's exposed flesh. Darters remain at long range, using blowgun. A darter tips its darts with a fast-acting, immobilizing poison, which it produces from glands in its mouth. By using their darts to immobilize enemies, darters give their melee-oriented cohorts more time to cause damage."

At night it reflects any ambient light, retaining its colors but not as radiant as during the day. When the spider has fed, it takes on a reddish tinge but this fades over a few days. A crystal spider is incapable of making sounds, but can communicate with others of its kind by means of controlled light. Crystal spiders get most of their nutrients from sunlight but do require liquids to survive, preferring human blood. They are hunted for their webs, which make excellent weapons, and for the gems which they instinctively weave into these webs (although the spiders are themselves unaware of their value).",

Divided among warriors, defilers and queens, they have no natural enemies but often create enemies through their predatory behavior when nesting young.

Warbands of warrior spiders are often led by individual defilers or psions, who use their powers to bolster the melee attacks of the warriors. In melee, dark spiders strike with two claws and a poisonous bite. The venom of the queen is particularly potent and is easily capable of killing an adult human. The poison of the other dark spiders is still dangerous but less routinely fatal than that of the queens.",

The queens lay their young in web sacs at the heart of their nests, where they are defended by elite bands of warriors and defiler/psions. Dark spider poison is greatly prized by assassins, and the wily creatures are not above trading their venom for warm meat for their young."

					"The nomadic ssurrans, also called sandscale lizard folk, traverse the blistering desert sands in loose tribes. The ssurrans are tribal in nature, roaming in groups of related families. At times these groups can dwindle in size, particularly after a lean spell, but tribes have also been known to band together for common purpose, forming vast hordes that last for as long as need or firm leadership binds them. The harsh conditions of life on Athas have driven many ssurrans to live the lives of raiders, taking by force what they cannot gain by other means. Some groups hunt while others raid settlements. They allow inhabitants to flee, and kill only those who resist. The ever-practical ssurrans then strip a village of its usable goods and move on. The tribe's hunters follow behind, clearing away signs of their passage and laying false trails.",
					"The more fortunate and enterprising tribes have turned to trade as a way of life, forging more productive relationships with the other peoples of their region. Whatever their major pastime, all ssurran tribes are natural scavengers and hunter-gatherers. Ssurrans rarely live outside a tribe. On rare occasion, a ssurran wanders alone, either as an outcast or the last of its tribe. Sometimes, slavers capture young ssurrans to sell in city-states as exotic merchandise. Ssurrans are hunted for their young by some. Ssurrans raised from the egg can be trained as guards, scouts, and gladiators, and are valued in the city-states of the south.

Standing up to 6 feet tall, they are a hardy species that have adapted to deal with Athas' unforgiving climate. In the region of the Scorched Plateau, their natural resistance to extremes of heat has allowed them to stake their claim over the immediate environs of Lava Gorge, where the majority of other races simply cannot venture. Ruled over by their priests, ssurrans hold ancient beliefs in strange gods and have a reputation for barbarism that is perhaps a little undeserved.",

Ssurrans would rather attack with superior numbers and have been known to flee from battles that they might have won simply because they have believed themselves to be outnumbered. For the ssurrans, the ideal battle is one where you and a large amount of your fellows strike from ambush, surprise the foe and over-run him with sheer numbers. Victorious ssurrans have been known to strip the corpses of the fallen, scarring or otherwise marking the dead as food, for later consumption. Ssurrans strike with dreadfully sharp claws and a savage, snapping bite. Those of a more civilized bent arm themselves with whatever weapons they can find and deal solid, brutal blows with these.

					"Lore",
					"The nomadic ssurrans, also called sandscale lizard folk, traverse the blistering desert sands in loose tribes. The ssurrans are tribal in nature, roaming in groups of related families. At times these groups can dwindle in size, particularly after a lean spell, but tribes have also been known to band together for common purpose, forming vast hordes that last for as long as need or firm leadership binds them. The harsh conditions of life on Athas have driven many ssurrans to live the lives of raiders, taking by force what they cannot gain by other means. Some groups hunt while others raid settlements. They allow inhabitants to flee, and kill only those who resist. The ever-practical ssurrans then strip a village of its usable goods and move on. The tribe's hunters follow behind, clearing away signs of their passage and laying false trails.",
					"The more fortunate and enterprising tribes have turned to trade as a way of life, forging more productive relationships with the other peoples of their region. Whatever their major pastime, all ssurran tribes are natural scavengers and hunter-gatherers. Ssurrans rarely live outside a tribe. On rare occasion, a ssurran wanders alone, either as an outcast or the last of its tribe. Sometimes, slavers capture young ssurrans to sell in city-states as exotic merchandise. Ssurrans are hunted for their young by some. Ssurrans raised from the egg can be trained as guards, scouts, and gladiators, and are valued in the city-states of the south. Ssurrans are strict carnivores, and some of their kind are reported to enjoy the flavor of halfling flesh over others (apparently they find it soft and sweet, but with a piquant after-taste...).",
					"Encounters",
					"A typical ssurran is laden down under patchwork armor, assorted bric-a-brac and battered trade goods, and armed with a bizarre assortment of weaponry from across the Tablelands. These reptilian humanoids roam the Tablelands, trading, raiding and hunting that which does not hunt them. Standing up to 6 feet tall, they are a hardy species that have adapted to deal with Athas' unforgiving climate. In the region of the Scorched Plateau, their natural resistance to extremes of heat has allowed them to stake their claim over the immediate environs of Lava Gorge, where the majority of other races simply cannot venture. Ruled over by their priests, ssurrans hold ancient beliefs in strange gods and have a reputation for barbarism that is perhaps a little undeserved.",
					"When it comes to battle, ssurrans are vicious, disorganized and somewhat cowardly. They prefer to maneuver their opponents into positions of disadvantage and will strike from ambush whenever possible. Ssurrans would rather attack with superior numbers and have been known to flee from battles that they might have won simply because they have believed themselves to be outnumbered. For the ssurrans, the ideal battle is one where you and a large amount of your fellows strike from ambush, surprise the foe and over-run him with sheer numbers. Victorious ssurrans have been known to strip the corpses of the fallen, scarring or otherwise marking the dead as food, for later consumption. Ssurrans strike with dreadfully sharp claws and a savage, snapping bite. Those of a more civilized bent arm themselves with whatever weapons they can find and deal solid, brutal blows with these. Impalers, macahuitl and spears are all popular arms with the ssurrans.",

					"Blackscale ssurran are proud and fierce fighters, concerned with heroic action and personal glory. Left on their own, they will fight as disorganized individuals, but their leaders can force them to work together for short periods of time. The blackscales have little patience for tricks and traps, considering such tools to be the trade of lesser ssurran. They are proud and arrogant, and are usually extremely hostile toward humans who trespass into the deep deserts where they live. While their culture is quite primitive, the black scales have access to the vaults and arsenals of ancient cities. High-ranking warriors or priests wear glittering bone and primitive ornaments, and the weapons of the blackscales are often elaborately carved and decorated.",
					"The blackscales typically live off the \"tribute\" they extract from the other tribes and merchant house offerings made to prevent them from raiding trade routes. The war priests hold the ultimate authority within society but rarely use this power; in the absence of interference from a priest, the most powerful warrior rules the tribe. Any of the three species of ssurran can be called to serve as a priests; the blackscales consider the priests to be chosen ones, and thus see no shame in following their commands.",

					"Ssurrans are hardy reptilian humanoids",
					"that live and hunt under the blazing sun. Like other Athasians, a ssurran's day-to-day goal is survival.",
					"Lore",
					"The nomadic ssurrans, also called sandscale lizard folk, traverse the blistering desert sands in loose tribes. The ssurrans are tribal in nature, roaming in groups of related families. At times these groups can dwindle in size, particularly after a lean spell, but tribes have also been known to band together for common purpose, forming vast hordes that last for as long as need or firm leadership binds them. The harsh conditions of life on Athas have driven many ssurrans to live the lives of raiders, taking by force what they cannot gain by other means. Some groups hunt while others raid settlements. They allow inhabitants to flee, and kill only those who resist. The ever-practical ssurrans then strip a village of its usable goods and move on. The tribe's hunters follow behind, clearing away signs of their passage and laying false trails.",
					"The more fortunate and enterprising tribes have turned to trade as a way of life, forging more productive relationships with the other peoples of their region. Whatever their major pastime, all ssurran tribes are natural scavengers and hunter-gatherers. Ssurrans rarely live outside a tribe. On rare occasion, a ssurran wanders alone, either as an outcast or the last of its tribe. Sometimes, slavers capture young ssurrans to sell in city-states as exotic merchandise. Ssurrans are hunted for their young by some. Ssurrans raised from the egg can be trained as guards, scouts, and gladiators, and are valued in the city-states of the south. Ssurrans are strict carnivores, and some of their kind are reported to enjoy the flavor of halfling flesh over others (apparently they find it soft and sweet, but with a piquant after-taste...).",
					"Encounters",
					"A typical ssurran is laden down under patchwork armor, assorted bric-a-brac and battered trade goods, and armed with a bizarre assortment of weaponry from across the Tablelands. These reptilian humanoids roam the Tablelands, trading, raiding and hunting that which does not hunt them. Standing up to 6 feet tall, they are a hardy species that have adapted to deal with Athas' unforgiving climate. In the region of the Scorched Plateau, their natural resistance to extremes of heat has allowed them to stake their claim over the immediate environs of Lava Gorge, where the majority of other races simply cannot venture. Ruled over by their priests, ssurrans hold ancient beliefs in strange gods and have a reputation for barbarism that is perhaps a little undeserved.",
					"When it comes to battle, ssurrans are vicious, disorganized and somewhat cowardly. They prefer to maneuver their opponents into positions of disadvantage and will strike from ambush whenever possible. Ssurrans would rather attack with superior numbers and have been known to flee from battles that they might have won simply because they have believed themselves to be outnumbered. For the ssurrans, the ideal battle is one where you and a large amount of your fellows strike from ambush, surprise the foe and over-run him with sheer numbers. Victorious ssurrans have been known to strip the corpses of the fallen, scarring or otherwise marking the dead as food, for later consumption. Ssurrans strike with dreadfully sharp claws and a savage, snapping bite. Those of a more civilized bent arm themselves with whatever weapons they can find and deal solid, brutal blows with these. Impalers, macahuitl and spears are all popular arms with the ssurrans.",
					"Ssurrans Blackscale",
					"Like their smaller cousins, blackscale ssurran are primitive reptilian humanoids that can be very dangerous if provoked. A blackscale lizardfolk is usually 8-1/2 to 9-1/2 feet tall, and weighs about 600 pounds. Its tail is 4 to 5 feet long.",
					"Blackscale ssurran are proud and fierce fighters, concerned with heroic action and personal glory. Left on their own, they will fight as disorganized individuals, but their leaders can force them to work together for short periods of time. The blackscales have little patience for tricks and traps, considering such tools to be the trade of lesser ssurran. They are proud and arrogant, and are usually extremely hostile toward humans who trespass into the deep deserts where they live. While their culture is quite primitive, the black scales have access to the vaults and arsenals of ancient cities. High-ranking warriors or priests wear glittering bone and primitive ornaments, and the weapons of the blackscales are often elaborately carved and decorated.",
					"The blackscales typically live off the \"tribute\" they extract from the other tribes and merchant house offerings made to prevent them from raiding trade routes. The war priests hold the ultimate authority within society but rarely use this power; in the absence of interference from a priest, the most powerful warrior rules the tribe. Any of the three species of ssurran can be called to serve as a priests; the blackscales consider the priests to be chosen ones, and thus see no shame in following their commands.",
					"Info",
					"Once in a generation a blackscale is born with tremendous strength, ferocity and evil in its heart. These fearsome creatures are touched by the demon lord Sess'inek's and gifted with demonic might. They soon take control of their tribe and quickly conquer other lesser ssurran tribe. Once they have gathered enough members they begin a campaign of slaughter and terror against other intelligent races. If left uncheck these tribe of ssurran can grow in numbers and even pose a threat to the city-states. In combat the blackscale warlord is rushing in the melee, killing everything that crosses his path."

The town of Gerot, nestled beneath a mountain range northeast of Raam, met with a particularly unpalatable end. According to legend, Gerot's people were great warriors, haughty and proud. They impressed Grand Vizier Abalach-Re, who offered the mountain community an alliance if its fighters would join Raam's legions. In their arrogance, the Gerotians declined, and they killed Abalach-Re's envoys. Enraged, the sorcerer-queen unleashed a vicious curse against Gerot's populace. The townsfolk were struck with an unquenchable thirst. The twisted brilliance behind her curse was that life-sustaining, pure water would bring death to any Gerotian. Within days, the entire town had died. What Abalach-Re hadn't expected was that every cursed Gerotian would rise in undeath, becoming the first thraxes.",
					"Encounters",
					"Insatiable thirst drives a thrax to hunt the living. The water vampire extracts fluids from the flesh of its victims. It's said to be an agonizing death. The distinctive cadavers are clearly the work of a thrax. Fearing retribution, the undead predator flees. A thrax wanders alone in parched misery. It loathes the monster it has become, but it cannot stop; its thirst is unbearable. Some thraxes seek revenge on Abalach-Re, and they haunt Raam and drink the sorcerer-queen's supporters dry. Because the corpse of a thrax victim is so easily recognized, few thrax live in cities or villages. Instead, they haunt the wastelands, oasis, and trade routes.",
					"Info",
					"Victims of an ancient curse, thrax are wretched creatures that can only survive by draining water from the bodies of others, leaving them desiccated corpses. A thrax's appearance is very different than what it was before \"the change.\" Its hair darkens and its skin takes on a ruddy tinge. Its facial features develop a gaunt, angular cast and its eyes become a deep blue. The most striking change is in its hands. Each of the thrax's fingers grows a circular \"sucker\" through which it drains water from its victims."

A templar of higher level can negate any action taken by one of lower level (prevent the requisitioning of money or troops, release accused prisoners, etc.). Templars of the same level who disagree must seek out someone of higher level within the hierarchy to arbitrate their differences.

					"Templars",
					"Templars are the most feared people in the city states. Their power to accuse and imprison nearly anyone for any reason keeps the city dwellers in terror. Not surprisingly, templars tend to abuse the powers they have for their own personal gain which, so long as the city is administered and kept in order, does not bother the sorcerer-king. Templars perform three vital functions within a given city state. Primarily, they comprise the city guards and officers of the sorcerer-king's armies. Secondly, they see to it that the city is administered, its businesses kept running, and its slaves fed. Finally, the templars are responsible for maintaining the illusion that the sorcerer-king is a god they have absolute power to enforce worship and homage to the sorcerer-kings. Every templar NPC will be actively pursuing one of these functions. One final, unwritten function of the templars is to advance through their ranks as rapidly as possible. The means by which a templar might gain power and position are wide open, including bribery, theft, and even assassination of others within their ranks. Every templar NPC can be counted on to accept underhanded schemes that will help him rise to power among his fellows.",
					"In the administration of the city states, templar NPCs occupy all positions from waste removal to the mayorship. Lower-Ranked templars (levels 1-4) are given the dirtier jobs tkat require hands-on work, having a few guards at their disposal and fewer slave laborers than tkey need to perform their tasks effectively. Ranked templars (levels 5-8) gain greater responsibilities and may have several lower- ranked templars beneath them. High- Ranked templars (levels 9 and higher) move into management of the city state such templars are difficult to unseat, since they can blame nearly any shortcomings on their underlings.",
					"These are only a sampling of the many levels of templar bureaucracy. Advancement through the ranks has little to do with ability or experience. Technically, the sorcerer-king is a god within his own city and the templars assure him of worship and obedience. In actuality, a sorcerer-king is not a god or a demigod, though he is generally an extremely powerful wizard and psionicist. However, the templars erect temples and subjugate the populations to worship him. There isn't a noble, merchant, or peasant in a city state who doesn't at least pay lip service to the sorcerer-king or the templars who enforce his will.",
					"The DM must keep two things in mind when dealing with any particular templar NPC. First, how will the templar attempt to use the player characters to gain advantage? He could accuse or imprison them, which always looks good in the eyes of a superior, or he could buy their services to perform a task suck as assassination or simply making a superior look bad. Second, the DM must consider how the player characters might appeal to the templar's wicked ways and greed. In their quest for power, they are sometimes easily manipulated. Beware, though higher-ranked templars have played these games of treachery before and, by their very existence, they've proven pretty good at them.",

					"Templar soldiers are the enforcement arm of their service to the sorcerer-king. Low-Ranked templars (levels 1-4) are common soldiers, guards within the cities around the slave areas practiced and drilled in formations around the city walls. Ranked templars (levels 5-8) are officers in charge of small (10-100 man) units of guards, slave soldiers, or undead soldiers (in times of war). High-Ranked templars (levels 9 +) are usually generals or administrators, keeping the army equipped and fed.",
					"Balic",
					"Balic's templars are unique in that the free citizens of the city elect them to their posts for ten-year terms, knowing them as praetor. Andropinis is generally tolerant of these elections, though he sometimes lets the citizens know which candidates he would like to have elected. If the wrong candidate wins the election, Andropinis has him executed and calls another vote. Andropinis' personal army consists of ten thousand highly disciplined foot soldiers who carry twelve-foot lances, large wooden shields, and thrusting short swords made from the sharpened thigh bones of erdlus.",
					"Info",
					"Personal guards, generals, and confidants of the dictator, high praetors occupy a position outside the elected praetor hierarchy. Amoral and greedy, high praetors ruthlessly serve Andropinis and enjoy great personal influence."

Jasuan knights are warriors born into one of the city's heroic clans, the descendants of great Draji heroes of long ago. Unlike the nobles of other city-states, Draji nobles aren't necessarily wealthy landowners. Their riches lie in their membership in the city's foremost clans, and their trade is war. Each noble clan claims the allegiance of certain artisan or merchant clans. Warriors of these lower clans are bound to \"their\" jasuans and fight under their command."

They are half-hunter and half-fighter, depending upon stealth to ambush their enemies and bows and arrows or {@condition poisoned} darts to slay them. Gulg does not have a landed nobility in the same manner as other city-states; agriculture is not prevalent, so owning property is not a sign of wealth. Instead, the noble class of Gulg is a meritocracy of hunters. The judagas warriors also serve as the heart of the army, although Gulg rarely goes to war openly. The term \"judaga\" means \"headhunter\" and refers to the hunters' practice of taking the heads of their enemies as trophies. They know a ritual that can trap the soul of a deceased warrior in its own skull, and the dagadas of the greatest hunters are adorned with such undead guardians. Judagas have no land or titles to pass on to their descendants, but they compete fiercely for trophies and rich spoils to buy wives, slaves, livestock, and houses full of luxuries that their families can enjoy for generations. A prominent judaga's family remains wealthy and influential long after the individual's death, and young hunters descended from renowned judagas are likely to become judagas themselves."

Templars perform three vital functions within a given city state. Primarily, they comprise the city guards and officers of the sorcerer-king's armies. Secondly, they see to it that the city is administered, its businesses kept running, and its slaves fed. Finally, the templars are responsible for maintaining the illusion that the sorcerer-king is a god they have absolute power to enforce worship and homage to the sorcerer-kings.

High- Ranked templars (levels 9 and higher) move into management of the city state such templars are difficult to unseat, since they can blame nearly any shortcomings on their underlings.",

Technically, the sorcerer-king is a god within his own city and the templars assure him of worship and obedience. In actuality, a sorcerer-king is not a god or a demigod, though he is generally an extremely powerful wizard and psionicist. However, the templars erect temples and subjugate the populations to worship him. There isn't a noble, merchant, or peasant in a city state who doesn't at least pay lip service to the sorcerer-king or the templars who enforce his will.",

He could accuse or imprison them, which always looks good in the eyes of a superior, or he could buy their services to perform a task suck as assassination or simply making a superior look bad. Second, the DM must consider how the player characters might appeal to the templar's wicked ways and greed. In their quest for power, they are sometimes easily manipulated.

The Lions are handpicked by the king among the ranks of his finest warriors and tought the art of defiler and preserver hunting. They watch carefuly for any sign of illegal use of magic and make sure the mages are punished for their transgression, usually put to death on the spot. Hamanu tought his warriors how to use the magical powers he grants them to protect themselves from magical attack and how to disturb spellcasters on the battlefield. To win their title the Lions must kill in single combat one of the great lions of the arena, they usually keep on their person a token of this victory, integrating it on their armor. The Lions of high ranks often possess one or several actual tamed Lions in their estate."

					"Werehyenas are humanoids, often male humans, who can transform themselves into hyena-like forms. Their packs roam the plains and deserts of Athas looking for prey. The humanoid form tends to be tall and sinewy, with long, shaggy hair usually tied back over their neck. In their human forms, werehyenas tend to be gregarious and charismatic, many possessing a loud, resounding laugh.",
					"The canine form appears to be a large hyena, over 6 foot long from snout to tail, with golden fur on its back and black fur on its belly and feet. It is not uncommon for a pack of these creatures to be followed by 2-12 normal hyenas. The normal hyenas are attracted to the lycanthropes, although not under their direct control.",
					"Gnoll's of the Dragon Horns have a fragile alliance's with the local packs of werehyenas and the two species are often known to collaborate against common enemies. Werehyenas consider themselves superior to gnolls, treating them as the beta of the pack until dominance is asserted by the gnoll. While they do not necessarily respect the gnoll on their own, werehyena thread lightly when it comes to their demonic lord, Yeenoghu.",
					"Encounters",
					"Werehyenas travel in close-knit packs of up to a dozen creatures, most of whom are males. The pack is run by a dominant male, who makes all important decisions, reinforcing them with an occasional, savage bite. Newly infected lycanthropes are welcomed into a pack only if the newcomer agrees to accept the pack leader's orders to the death. If not, a fight for dominance usually ensues, with the victor becoming the new pack leader. Among themselves, they can be playful and capable of lasting intimacy. They mate for life, but only with other members of the pack. From one to four cubs are born with each litter; 75% of them are male.",
					"Werehyena packs scour the desert and plains in human form, seeking human settlements to infiltrate. A favorite ploy is for a single lycanthrope to enter a town or village and use its charm ability to win its way into the hearts of the people. Some are even known to shower gifts on a long-forgotten sister or relative. The gifts are typically small gems which it gathers for this purpose. The lycanthrope then lures the victim out of town to a trap, where the rest of the pack lies in wait.",
					"Info",
					"Werehyenas are covert hunters, preying on gullible humans whenever possible. However, like their normal cousins, they are excellent scavengers, capable of eating just about anything in order to survive. Although their numbers are great, they are too widely scattered to have any profound effect upon the ecology of Athas."

					"Werehyenas are humanoids, often male humans, who can transform themselves into hyena-like forms. Their packs roam the plains and deserts of Athas looking for prey. The humanoid form tends to be tall and sinewy, with long, shaggy hair usually tied back over their neck. In their human forms, werehyenas tend to be gregarious and charismatic, many possessing a loud, resounding laugh.",
					"The canine form appears to be a large hyena, over 6 foot long from snout to tail, with golden fur on its back and black fur on its belly and feet. It is not uncommon for a pack of these creatures to be followed by 2-12 normal hyenas. The normal hyenas are attracted to the lycanthropes, although not under their direct control.",
					"Gnoll's of the Dragon Horns have a fragile alliance's with the local packs of werehyenas and the two species are often known to collaborate against common enemies. Werehyenas consider themselves superior to gnolls, treating them as the beta of the pack until dominance is asserted by the gnoll. While they do not necessarily respect the gnoll on their own, werehyena thread lightly when it comes to their demonic lord, Yeenoghu.",
					"Encounters",
					"Werehyenas travel in close-knit packs of up to a dozen creatures, most of whom are males. The pack is run by a dominant male, who makes all important decisions, reinforcing them with an occasional, savage bite. Newly infected lycanthropes are welcomed into a pack only if the newcomer agrees to accept the pack leader's orders to the death. If not, a fight for dominance usually ensues, with the victor becoming the new pack leader. Among themselves, they can be playful and capable of lasting intimacy. They mate for life, but only with other members of the pack. From one to four cubs are born with each litter; 75% of them are male.",
					"Werehyena packs scour the desert and plains in human form, seeking human settlements to infiltrate. A favorite ploy is for a single lycanthrope to enter a town or village and use its charm ability to win its way into the hearts of the people. Some are even known to shower gifts on a long-forgotten sister or relative. The gifts are typically small gems which it gathers for this purpose. The lycanthrope then lures the victim out of town to a trap, where the rest of the pack lies in wait.",
					"Info",
					"The leader of a werehyena stays in charge until it's too weak to lead and is killed by a younger, stronger pack member. The alpha is a cunning and cruel killer, ruling his pack with an iron fist. In combat the alpha is the first to leap in the melee and always the last to stand. Despite his predilection for violence the alpha prefer to attack when his pack has a strategic advantage and will make good use of cover, high ground and other possible edge. At the end of the hunt the alpha is always the first to choose his share of the kill."

Motivated by hunger for living souls and driven by the same desire for power that awakened them in undeath, some wights serve as shock troops for evil leaders, including wraiths. As soldiers, they are able to plan but seldom do so, relying on their hunger for destruction to overwhelm any creature that stands before them. Wights are unscrupulous about allies, although a habit of the creature's living existence might influence its associations. Some wights work with living allies whose pursuits parallel a wight's dark appetites. More commonly, wights abide the presence of predatory breasts, which don't see the undead creatures as food."

The splinter accesses the memories, needs, and desires of the body's former occupant. Those passions are married to an overwhelming hunger for life force, and a wight is born.

Experienced hunters also know that killing a Wight requires its body's destruction. Dismemberment followed by fire is the surest way to accomplish that.

					"Once, every city in Athas was led by a king or queen. They were the top of the social order. Often, they lived near the city in a fortified palace bustling with minor officials. When a potentate found it necessary to leave his or her palace, he or she did so only with a great deal of preparations and pomp, well-protected by magic and a full bodyguard retinue.",
					"Almost without exception, every king or queen was a powerful Defiler who had risen to his or her position through the unprincipled use of magical and psionic abilities. Each would use his or her magic to prolong his or her life, and most have reigned for hundreds of years.",
					"Currently, there are only three sorcerer-kings in the Tablelands. The Shadow King Nibenay openly rules the city of the same name at the eastern edge of the Crescent Forest. To the far side of the forest is the Oba, Lalai-Puy. Finally, the warrior king Hamanu presides over militaristic Urik to the north.",
					"A Sorcerer-King/Queen's Lair",
					"A sorcerer-king/queen lives within its palace in a city that sees it as a divine being. Everything about the sorcerer-king/queen's lair and its surrounding city reflects its ego and keen mind, from the architecture to the servants. Often, the sorcerer-king/queen is surrounded by its most trusted agents, templars, who are granted magical powers from their patrons."
