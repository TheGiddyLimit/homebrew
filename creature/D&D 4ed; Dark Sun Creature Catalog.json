					"Lore",
					"Most creatures perceive ambush drakes as deadly draconic hunters of limited intelligence. However, they are social creatures among their own kind. Ambush drakes share the classic dragon mentality of hoarding treasure, but a pack doesn't believe in individual ownership. While one ambush drake might use an item at any given moment, the pack owns the treasure, and tomorrow another ambush drake might use it.",
					"An ambush drake prefers to move about on all fours, using terrain for cover until they are close enough to charge their prey. An ambush drake typically weighs 200 pounds and has a 5-foot-long body. Its scales display dark shades of red or brown, allowing him to move unseen in the mountains or rocky badlands of Athas. Ambush drake live in rocky areas, and like to hide in caves during the coldest hours of the night. They are usually hunting during the day, leaving with the sunrise and returning in their lair with the sunset.",
					"Ambush drakes can speak Common and Draconic, but rarely choose to do so. Instead, they communicate telepathically with their kind. Ambush drakes share a communal consciousness, enabling them to communicate telepathically with other ambush drakes.",
					"Encounter",
					"Ambush drakes generally stalk their prey as a coordinated pack. They start by using their breath weapons and focus attacks on affected creatures, ignoring quicker fleeing prey."

Wasteland raiders convince groups of anakores to work for them by paying the creatures with food and shiny baubles. Dreams and visions also entice anakores to explore ancient ruins where other aberrant creatures dwell, some of which are stronger and cleverer than even the dune kings. In such places, anakores serve these creatures and join in their incomprehensible rites. Anakores burrow under prey before rising to attack. Hunters emerge, grab targets, and use drag under to reduce the number of enemies they must face. Renders burst from the sands, stay among the prey topside, and lay targets low to make them more vulnerable to allied attacks. A dune king launches into battle with sand eruption and uses its toxic claws to prevent the quarry from escaping. When caught in poor tactical situations, anakores flee or deal peacefully (but grudgingly) with enemies.",

					"Anywhere that rough terrain provides cover for their burrows, baazrags can be found in large numbers. These wild beasts are vermin that eat anything they can find. Each individual sees to its own needs, fattening up on weeds and tiny prey, and storing water in a sac under its bony back shell. When larger prey is found, the pack works together for the promise ofa good meal for all. All baazrags are born female. Some members of a pack become male when an egg-laying breeder is nearby. These males tend to the breeder, defending her and her eggs as well as any hatchlings. Powerful baazrags have a natural psychic sensitivity. Large psychic disturbances irritate these creatures and can drive them to attack.",

					"Humanoids of all sorts domesticate baazrags, which make good house guards and pest hunters. Baazrags are also used to carry small loads or pull small vehicles. If a baazrag is born among other types of creatures or becomes accustomed to those who offer it food and comfort, it considers such beings to be part of its pack. Clever humanoids use this trait to tame baazrags as guard beasts. Baazrags tend to ignore creatures they cannot eat, such as undead. These inedible creatures, in turn, treat the baazrags similarly and ignore them. Thus, explorers might find a lair being shared by the two groups. Baazrags gain confidence, focus, and ferocity in numbers. Although they hunt singly, each baazrag acts as a scout for the pack. When a hunter finds prey, its distinct call brings its mates to swarm over the target. The baazrags relentlessly bite this prey and follow the creature until it falls or it proves too tough to pull down, forcing the baazrags to retreat. A baazrag breeder enters combat by culling a victim from the herd with psychiClure. Then it pounces on that individual, distinguishing it as a target for at least a few of its brood.",

It is possible that some great harm came to brohgs long ago through the misuse of arcane power, or that the brohg race was spawned through the manipulation of such energy.",
					"Once in every generation or two, a brohg is born with innate arcane power that manifests in adolescence. Afraid to kill the accursed one for fear of releasing evil spirits, the tribe banishes the renegade into the wastes, where it travels alone and lives as a hermit. Few such renegades have the wherewithal to learn anything more difficult than defiling sorcery. The use of defiling magic eventually taints these brohg renegades, and their belief that they are possessed by evil spirits hastens their corruption.",

A brohg might be found as a mercenary or a slave soldier among civilized folk or in an arena. Evil creatures join forces with malevolent brohg renegades, and in a few cases, such renegades have set themselves up as masters of other degenerate brohgs.",
					"Info",
					"Brohgs dislike spellcasters and are enraged by defilers and by those who abuse arcane magic. Such talents are taboo among brohg tribes. When a brohg is born capable of using magic, it is branded a renegade among its own kind."

A chathrang looks like an outsized tortoise, its back covered with reed like protrusions. These tubes shoot quills covered with a sticky toxin.

Chathrangs prey on small flying birds or insects, but they capture land-dwelling prey if nothing else is available.",

They make their homes near sources of plentiful prey, sharing the food they capture with other predators in exchange for protection. Training a chathrang is difficult and rarely worth the effort, though dune traders and assassins sometimes keep the creatures to harvest the toxin they secrete. Captive chathrangs aren't reliable guards, but they might become agitated and attack in chaotic situations.",

When hurt, a chathrang instinctively hides inside its bony shell."

Down the back from the bulge runs a spine that becomes a long, thin, whip-like tail that ends in an appendage known as a zip. The zip is comprised of razor-sharp, barbed ridges that grow at the tip of the spine. The interior mouth or maw (20 + feet across) is lined with row upon row of razor-sharp cartilage ridges.",

They have a special fondness for rocs, pterrax, and flying humanoids. The ray has no true stomach, preferring to swallow prey completely and grind the victim to liquid on its interior jaw ridges to help aid with digestion. After a good meal, cloud rays will sometimes psionically dream travel while their meal digests. Cloud rays have territorial respect for others of their species and, with very few exceptions, do not intrude into another ray's air space.",

Their four webbed feet end in sharp, triangular claws. Water drakes tails are thinner and flatter than other drakes, and they provide excellent propulsion when in water. Water drakes are reclusive and prefer as little contact with humanity as possible. They will avoid intruders, but will kill without hesitation those humanoids who trespass upon their lair. Because of the horrors rent upon the planet by humanoids, water drakes have absolutely no regard for such life. Their four webbed feet help them move large quantities of sand. All four feet have sharp, triangular claws designed for digging into and holding onto prey, or for raking. ",

Looking back to the other wagons, they watch in awe as people and kanks rise into the air, suspended by an unseen force, then plummet into the rocky depths. From midair bursts a monster amid a flurry of raking claws and buffeting winds. Air drakes are ambush predators that prefer to tenderize their food by dropping it from a great height. They commonly attack creatures traveling along dangerous precipices. A drake sails in surrounded by its wind veil and rips at its target, then buffets the victim with a blast of wind to force it over the edge.

The hindlegs are equally as powerful and may be used for digging, but most often serve as anchors. Earth drakes' tails are short but incredibly thick, which forces the monsters to swagger when they walk.",

					"Dune stalkers are creatures native to the Elemental Plane of Earth",
					"though they are also frequently found on the Gray Waste of Hades. These monsters revel in evil and take their only joy from spreading its blight. They despise the Material Plane and avoid it as much as possible. Even so, they are sometimes summoned there by evil characters to kill targets or carry out other quests.",
					"Lore",
					"A dune stalker appears humanoid. It stands approximately 7 feet tall, but it would be taller if stretched out or forced to stand erect. Its head is triangular, and the neck attaches near the top of the head, causing its leering, toothy face and pointed chin to hang below its shoulders. The dune stalker's gangly body is hairless, and its red, dusty, abrasive skin has no pores. The combination of short legs, long arms, and stooped posture causes its hands to drag on the ground. Its fingers and toes (four on each limb) are long and bony. The creature has massive shoulders and an enormous chest, which tapers to a narrow waist and hips. A dune stalker that has been assigned a mission by its summoner pursues the literal fulfillment of its instructions to the exclusion of all else. It resents its time on the Material Plane and wants to make its stay there as short as possible. Occasionally, a summoner's instructions are phrased in such a way that the dune stalker cannot actually carry them out. In this case, it is trapped on the Material Plane, where it takes out its frustration by killing all creatures it finds. Despite their sonic abilities, dune stalkers do not speak, though they understand Common and Terran.",
					"Encounters",
					"A dune stalker's preferred tactic is to hide in a rocky area and attack from ambush. When possible, it tries to gain higher ground on its opponents by climbing up on a rock or a structure to conceal itself. It often begins an assault by using its shout ability to disorient a group of opponents, then leaping into combat to deliver its kiss of death. Against foes within its reach, a dune stalker usually prefers to deliver a kiss of death against just one target rather than a shout against the whole group. The preferred target is the one it seeks to slay, or the one that presents the greatest danger, or the one that appears to have the strongest good alignment. (Given the dune stalker's demented psychology, this last could be just about anyone, but paladins usually stand out.)"

					"who now cling to a handful of crumbling palaces in the Lands Within the Wind, eladrin are rare in the cities and villages of Athas. They guard the few remaining passages between the world and their realm, bewitching or slaying travelers who wander too close to their ancient places.",
					"Lore",
					"Great eladrin realms once spanned the Lands Within the Wind, but over the centuries the fey otherworld has slowly receded, consumed by the defiling magic that ravaged Athas. As their world died, the fey kingdoms fell into ruin. The eladrin now inhabit a handful of palaces and castles, a small remnant of their former numbers. They guard the hidden doors to their diminished realm with illusions and mazes of psionic enchantment.",
					"A rare few eladrin, twisted by the slow death of their realm, have become so hate· filled that they sacrifice themselves for the opportunity to hunt those they blame for their home's destruction. These windwalkers allow their essence to slowly bleed into the Lands Within the Wind in exchange for infusion with the energy of that plane. They haunt the trade ways near eladrin lands, slaying every humanoid they can catch unprotected. During their final years of existence, windwalkers fade to ghostlike, semisolid embodiments of murderous hatred.",
					"Encounters",
					"Eladrin have little in common with their elf cousins, but both races recognize their old kinship and honor it. Eladrin emissaries might travel with elf tribes for a time to spy on the deserts and cities of Athas. More vicious eladrin, especially windwalkers, occasionally throw in with bandits or other violent humanoids dwelling at the edges of their territory.",
					"Info",
					"These enigmatic and powerful psychic are only female eladrin. They are guiding the eladrin and acting as sage, oracle and spiritual leader in the eladrin's society. They are rarely seen on the world of Athas and most of them stay in the dying Land Within the Winds but on some occasion some cross the veil and take actions in the wastes. A white lady shape the battlefield with her illusions, changing the world with her sheer will. She supports the eladrin veiled warrior and windwalker from a distance and retreat into Etherealness if her life is threatened."

					"Weirds are cryptic beings of elemental force who are powerful in the art of divination. They are oracles, soothsayers, and seers of knowledge past, present, and future. Each weird is composed of material from one of the four elements (air, earth, fire, or water) and has special knowledge of the particular aspect of fate with which its element is associated (see below). These creatures dwell in remote or hidden locations on the Material Plane a fact that makes travel difficult for those seeking their counsel. The upper body of a weird always resembles that of a beautiful female humanoid. The lower half may be either humanoid or a serpentine column. A weird rises from a pool of the appropriate element, which it can never leave.",

The pool is always secured to a flat surface (floor, wall, or ceiling; see individual entries for possible orientations) such that its depth forms a hollow within that surface. The surface must have sufficient depth to accommodate the pool. An elemental pool can also exist as a separate area inside a larger volume of the same element; for example, a water weird's pool might be situated at the bottom of an ocean or lake. The base of the pool contains a portal to the weird's native plane. Creatures granted access to the pool by the weird must provide their own protection from the elemental material, as well as the means to breathe and move within that enviroment. Otherwise, they suffer the effects given in the individual entry. A weird is physically tied to its pool and cannot leave except to return to its native plane through the portal. A weird may rise up to a height of 10 feet above the surface of its pool, but the lower part of its body must always remain in contact with the elemental material. Once a weird exits the pool for its native plane, the portal closes, and the pool loses its special effects. Air Pool. An air weird's pool is filled with billowing, gusting vapors of breathable air and mist. Creatures without the ability to fly cannot move through it, except by falling. An air weird's pool may be affixed to any vertical or horizontal surface, and it may be right side up or upside down (if affixed to a ceiling, for example). Fire Pool. This pool contains a torrent of dancing flames that burn and smoke continually. Unprotected flammable materials within a fire pool catch on fire immediately, and any creature within the pool takes 3d10 fire damage per round. Creatures without the ability to fly cannot move through this pool, except by falling. A fire weird's pool may be affixed to any vertical or horizontal surface, and it may appear only in a right side up position (such as on the floor of a cavern). Earth Pool. This pool is filled with churning mud, rocks, and earth. Every creature within it (except the earth weird and earth elementals) takes 4d8 bludgeonning damage per round from the ever-grinding earth. In addition, creatures entering the pool suffocate if they do not have a way to breathe and are entombed (restrained) if they cannot burrow. An earth weird's pool may be affixed only to a horizontal surface, and it may appear only in a right side up position (such as in the floor of a cavern). Water Pool. This pool is filled with bubbling, swirling water. Any creature within it that cannot breathe water immediately begins to drown. Any creature without the ability to swim cannot move through a water pool, except by falling. A water weird's pool may be affixed only to a horizontal surface, and it may appear only in a right side up position (such as on the floor of a cavern).",

					"Air weirds are elemental spirits that offer direction and guidance to those traveling into unknown areas. They can point out paths not considered, reveal unknown doors into new worlds, and describe what may be needed to survive such journeys. An air weird's pool is often found outside, in an open-air place such as a windy plain or on a mountaintop. An air weird appears as a ghostly, translucent woman composed of flowing vapors. Its eyes are deep blue, and its hair appears windblown. The lower half of the creature's body is a tendril of mist that trails back into its pool."

An air weird's pool is filled with billowing, gusting vapors of breathable air and mist. Creatures without the ability to fly cannot move through it, except by falling. An air weird's pool may be affixed to any vertical or horizontal surface, and it may be right side up or upside down (if affixed to a ceiling, for example). Fire Pool. This pool contains a torrent of dancing flames that burn and smoke continually. Unprotected flammable materials within a fire pool catch on fire immediately, and any creature within the pool takes 3d10 fire damage per round. Creatures without the ability to fly cannot move through this pool, except by falling. A fire weird's pool may be affixed to any vertical or horizontal surface, and it may appear only in a right side up position (such as on the floor of a cavern). Earth Pool. This pool is filled with churning mud, rocks, and earth. Every creature within it (except the earth weird and earth elementals) takes 4d8 bludgeonning damage per round from the ever-grinding earth. In addition, creatures entering the pool suffocate if they do not have a way to breathe and are entombed (restrained) if they cannot burrow. An earth weird's pool may be affixed only to a horizontal surface, and it may appear only in a right side up position (such as in the floor of a cavern). Water Pool. This pool is filled with bubbling, swirling water. Any creature within it that cannot breathe water immediately begins to drown. Any creature without the ability to swim cannot move through a water pool, except by falling. A water weird's pool may be affixed only to a horizontal surface, and it may appear only in a right side up position (such as on the floor of a cavern).",

They guide the long-suffering and ignorant to new peace and prosperity. The beautiful, feminine half of a fire weird is a humanoid form composed of flickering flames and wreathed with smoke. The lower half of the body snakes away in a fiery trail into the hazy, flame-filled pool."

					"Lore",
					"Weirds are cryptic beings of elemental force who are powerful in the art of divination. They are oracles, soothsayers, and seers of knowledge past, present, and future. Each weird is composed of material from one of the four elements (air, earth, fire, or water) and has special knowledge of the particular aspect of fate with which its element is associated (see below). These creatures dwell in remote or hidden locations on the Material Plane a fact that makes travel difficult for those seeking their counsel. The upper body of a weird always resembles that of a beautiful female humanoid. The lower half may be either humanoid or a serpentine column. A weird rises from a pool of the appropriate element, which it can never leave.",
					"A weird can divine information that could change the very course of history. It has its finger on the pulse of fate and knows exactly where possible courses of action might lead. Like most seers, an elemental weird never provides a clear, concise prophecy. Some of the message may seem forthright, but some is always confusing or just difficult to decipher because the listener does not have enough information to understand the weird's meaning. Though its messages can be misinterpreted, a weird's warnings and advice are never wrong. Its counsel is seldom free, however, so anyone beseeching a weird had best bring offerings or be prepared to undertake a quest of vital importance to the creature.",
					"Encounter",
					"All weirds, regardless of their elemental subtypes, are connected to each other in fundamental ways. They share a unique, secret bond that is evidenced in their level of cooperation. A weird that cannot provide the desired knowledge to a supplicant usually guides him or her to another weird for better counsel. Weirds of different elements often place their pools close to one another to broaden the range of divination services available to supplicants in an area. Weirds are strongly linked to the Material Plane. They have all chosen to leave their native planes and serve as diviners for the humanoid races. Though they are bound to their pools, weirds can interact with other races though mortal agents that specialize in divination magic.",
					"Elemental weirds do not fight if they can avoid it. If they must fight, they begin by summoning elementals to defend them. If any other elementals are present (regardless of type), the weird attempts to gain control of them and turn them against its foes. Meanwhile, the weird remains in the center of its pool, using divination magic to foresee possible consequences of the battle and acting accordingly. If forced into melee, a weird uses its reach to lash out at nearby foes. If seriously threatened, a weird retreats back to its plane of origin.",
					"Elemental Pool",
					"Each weird dwells within a large pool (at least 20 feet across and 40 feet deep) filled with the purest form of its element. The pool is always secured to a flat surface (floor, wall, or ceiling; see individual entries for possible orientations) such that its depth forms a hollow within that surface. The surface must have sufficient depth to accommodate the pool. An elemental pool can also exist as a separate area inside a larger volume of the same element; for example, a water weird's pool might be situated at the bottom of an ocean or lake. The base of the pool contains a portal to the weird's native plane. Creatures granted access to the pool by the weird must provide their own protection from the elemental material, as well as the means to breathe and move within that enviroment. Otherwise, they suffer the effects given in the individual entry. A weird is physically tied to its pool and cannot leave except to return to its native plane through the portal. A weird may rise up to a height of 10 feet above the surface of its pool, but the lower part of its body must always remain in contact with the elemental material. Once a weird exits the pool for its native plane, the portal closes, and the pool loses its special effects. Air Pool. An air weird's pool is filled with billowing, gusting vapors of breathable air and mist. Creatures without the ability to fly cannot move through it, except by falling. An air weird's pool may be affixed to any vertical or horizontal surface, and it may be right side up or upside down (if affixed to a ceiling, for example). Fire Pool. This pool contains a torrent of dancing flames that burn and smoke continually. Unprotected flammable materials within a fire pool catch on fire immediately, and any creature within the pool takes 3d10 fire damage per round. Creatures without the ability to fly cannot move through this pool, except by falling. A fire weird's pool may be affixed to any vertical or horizontal surface, and it may appear only in a right side up position (such as on the floor of a cavern). Earth Pool. This pool is filled with churning mud, rocks, and earth. Every creature within it (except the earth weird and earth elementals) takes 4d8 bludgeonning damage per round from the ever-grinding earth. In addition, creatures entering the pool suffocate if they do not have a way to breathe and are entombed (restrained) if they cannot burrow. An earth weird's pool may be affixed only to a horizontal surface, and it may appear only in a right side up position (such as in the floor of a cavern). Water Pool. This pool is filled with bubbling, swirling water. Any creature within it that cannot breathe water immediately begins to drown. Any creature without the ability to swim cannot move through a water pool, except by falling. A water weird's pool may be affixed only to a horizontal surface, and it may appear only in a right side up position (such as on the floor of a cavern).",
					"Info",
					"Water weirds are soothsayers that bring words of healing to the wounded. They offer curative knowledge for suffering lands and new options for people who seek a better way. When there is little hope for life, water weirds offer a way to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat against all odds. A water weird appears as a translucent, blue humanoid woman composed entirely of water. Its feet remain below the surface of its pool at all times."

Its massive, round body has a pair of useless wings that fold in at its sides. A snakelike neck rises to a small round head with a huge, wedge-shaped beak. A pair of powerful, lanky legs extend down from the body and end in four-toed, razor-clawed feet.",
					"Erdlus make ideal herd animals because of their temperaments and ability to survive on a variety of foods. They can eat many forms of tough vegetation, as well as snakes, reptiles, and insects. The eggs that erdlus provide are an excellent source of nutrition. A diet of erdlu eggs can keep a human or demihuman alive for months at a time, for the eggs are packed with a variety of nutrients and essential vitamins. If an erdlu egg is eaten raw, it is a substitute for one gallon of water. However, this substitution is not perfect and can only be used successfully for no more than one week. The meat of an erdlu also makes an excellent meal.",

For short distances of no more than half a mile, erdlus can race along at great speeds (50 feet). Their normal walking pace is much slower (30 feet). When escape is not possible, the flock turns and fights as a group. They strike first with sharp beaks (inflicting 1d6 points of damage) then rake with one of their claws (causing 1d4 points of damage).",

It relies on its sturdy shell to ward off attacks as it closes to snatch up prey with its mandibles. Once it has grabbed a creature, it uses feathery probe to tear apart its victim's mind. The mind hunter turns its prey's thoughts and fears against other enemies, blasting them with force wave or enslaving them with mind wrench."

					"Lore",
					"A grisgol is a horrifying construct composed of broken and worn-out magic items, animated by a powerful spellcaster who has harnessed the spirit of a lich. Its skeleton is fabricated from old staffs and wands and its skin from expended scrolls wrapped about it like a mummy's burial cloth. Woven into this are rings, bracers, fragments of leather or chainmail, and the like. Inside the creature are scores of half-empty vials of potions, unguents, and oils, vaguely resembling sets of internal organs. It typically wears a rune-scribed cloak or robe. Pinpoints of red light glare from underneath a hood or old helmet. Nestled inside the construct, among miscellaneous junk, is the original lich's phylactery. Unless one knows what animates a grisgol, the phylactery appears as another piece of spent magic trash tossed loosely and randomly into the insides of the construct. From a distance, a grisgol appears to be a mummy, even moving with a similar stiff gait. When it walks, one can hear the tinkling of glass touching glass, the sloshing of half-filled vials and bottles, the squeaking of leather, the rubbing of wood and bone against each other, and, most prominently, the shuffl ing of paper as if pages of a tome were caught in a slight breeze. Thin tendrils of black smoke escape from cracks in its body. A grisgol leaves a sooty, oily residue upon whatever it touches. A grisgol is in every way a magic construct, possessing all traits native to golems in addition to the abilities of the lich that powers it. A grisgol's damaging and paralyzing touch attacks are the same as a lich and the construct retains a fraction of the original lich's spell-casting ability. A grisgol only casts the spells scribed by its creator on the scrolls and tome pages that make up its outer skin.",
					"The spells a grisgol can cast are, however, restricted to the spell levels, domains, and specializations the lich (a 20th-level cleric, sorcerer, or wizard) could have cast. Destroying a grisgol does not destroy the lich that powers it. To kill the lich, its phylactery must be destroyed after the grisgol is destroyed. Otherwise, the lich is free to return in a physical form in 1d10 days. The escaped lich retains all the powers and abilities it had previous to its entrapment. The lich seeks vengeance upon whoever possesses its phylactery and the wizard, sorcerer, or cleric who originally entrapped it in the body of a grisgol. A grisgol stands 8 feet tall and weighs about 400 pounds. It knows all the languages known by the lich whose phylactery animates it.",
					"Encounters",
					"Grisgol are rare, even by golem standards. They are solitary construct that exist solely to serve the will of their master. Once this master has died it continues to fulfil his duty, oblivious of the pointless reason behind it. In the region of Raam, particularly ancient tombs are rumored to hold mysterious string of parchment, driving those reading them to madness and death. Other reports from adventurers tell the stories of strange mummies invulnerable to most of their known weaknesses.",
					"Lich sometimes create grisgol as punishment for their rivals, hiding their phylactery in the construct and sending them to impossible and pointless mission. They are reveling in the knowledge that their enemy can do nothing but rage silently while his immortality is wasted away."

He dedicates every waking hour to this massive undertaking, barely pausing to eat or rest, in order to finish this task as fast as possible. The victim always thinks, and tries to convince others, that he is on the brink of a revelation. His personal study becomes cluttered with diagrams, charts, and plans extrapolating how the pieces might fit together, constantly rearranging them to fit current theories or hunches. The victim of the curse loses {@dice 1d4} point of Intelligence per day. Once it reach 0, the creature dies. The Intelligence cannot be restored while the curse is lasting. Only a heal spell or similarly powerful magic can relieve a victim of this curse, the Intelligence lost is then recovered after the victim finish a short or long rest.

					"Hej-kin are a race of vile-looking humanoids who inhabit the natural subterranean caverns and tunnels of Athas.",
					"Hej-kin have round chubby faces which are accented by large noses and small, slanted eyes. The ears of hej-kin are pointed, short, and covered with a thick fur. The skin color of hej-kin varies greatly, from deep red to a dark mossy green. Most hejkin clans will usually be all of the same color skin, and most tend to be reddish and orange colored. The skin of a hej-kin is thick and very tough, similar in texture to softened leather hide.",
					"The language of the hej-kin is a combination of sign and verbal communication. Hej-kin speak in a low-pitched voice that resembles human mumbling in sound. Very few aboveground dwellers are familiar with the language of the hej-kin, for it is extremely difficult to learn.",
					"Most clans make their homes in caverns adjacent to underground streams providing the clan with an adequate supply of water. Unlike many other types of subterranean dwellers, hej-kin do not dig tunnels or caves, for doing so would disturb the earth, which they consider sacred.",
					"The average hej-kin clan contains four to five families, each consisting of three to six members. A family's living area is usually a smaller cave connected by tunnel to the cavern occupied by the rest of the clan. Hej-kin mark their dwellings by runes on the outer cave walls.",
					"Hej-kin are omnivores, relying on both meat and vegetables as sources of food. Most of their food comes from subterranean plants and small underground creatures."

					"Fear on Athas",

Unknown, perhaps unknowable, dangers lie in wait on all sides: Boulders conceal vicious predators, a gloomy cave harbors cruel slave hunters, and forest canopies shadow far more than shrubs. The id fiend revels in these doubts, using them against its prey, magnifying anxieties until the line between fantasy and reality is shattered.",
					"Lore",
					"Instructors at the House of the Mind in Draj pay top coin for living id fiend specimens. They use a number of the fiend's organs and fluids in concoctions that awaken latent talent in their students. Most mixtures distilled by these seers and alchemists are of dubious purpose. Still, the id fiend's cranial fluid is a key component of terror ichor.",
					"Encounters",
					"Despite its monstrous appearance, an id fiend is intelligent and not above associating with other creatures. Still, such alliances (if they truly are alliances) are short-lived. A fiend's mere presence is often enough to set the dimmest creature's nerves on edge.",
					"When an id fiend is encountered with other creatures, they might be unwitting servants, seeing their fears manifested in the adventurers. If the party destroys the id fiend first, the other opponents might stand down, flee, or even befriend the heroes for a time.",
					"Info",
					"Terrors come to life when an id fiend is near. Shadows darken and writhe, the ground crawls with vermin, and strange sounds echo all around. Against reason, a creature's deepest fears skulk nearby, lurking behind rocks or whispering from shadows. The id fiend magnifies the sensations until its prey can bear these fears no longer. Once gripped with terror, the id fiend's target comes to accept its doom."

					"Kanks are large docile insects often used as mounts by the people of the Tablelands. A black exoskeleton of chitin covers their segmented bodies. The three body sections are the head, thorax, and abdomen. They weigh as much as 400 pounds, grow to heights of 4 feet at the back, and as long as 8 feet from head to abdomen. Around their mouths, they have multi-jointed pincers that they can use to carry objects, feed themselves, or fight. Six lanky legs descend from their thoraxes. Each ends in a single flexible claw that allows them to grip the surfaces they walk upon.",
					"Kanks are often used as caravan mounts. They can travel a full day at their top speed, carrying a 200-pound passenger and 200 pounds of cargo. Kanks make decent herd animals, but usually only elves employ them as such. As kanks can digest almost any sort of organic matter, they can thrive in most terrain types. In addition, these creatures require little special attention. A kank hive instinctively organizes itself into food producers, soldiers, and brood queens."

They adjust their tactics depending on the creature they hunt. They might make noises to unnerve their enemies and drive them into foolish actions. They could also be silent, keeping to the shadows until it is time to strike. They watch and wait or hit and run as circumstances allow, delaying their final assault until the heat and sun have taken their toll.",

They are found in the company of halflings most often, but wilderness goliath and gith tribes also regularly hunt with kirres.",

					"A kirre is a cautious hunter, watching and tracking its prey for miles before engaging. During the hunt, the kirre stays back, growling and chirping to rattle the quarry. As the kirre grows hungry and its prey grows fatigued, the beast draws closer. The kirre attacks only when the quarry is weakened or distracted, or when it appears the prey might escape. The kirre leaps at its prey, raking with its claws before springing away. When it closes for good, the beast viciously rips its victim apart."

The kirre is eight feet in length and has eight legs, each ending in paws that sport very sharp claws. The kirre also has large horns on either sides of its head and a sharp barbed tail spike often used as a weapon. The mouth of the kirre is large and has sharp, canine teeth, which are used mostly for tearing food that has been killed. The kirre is a fur-covered animal with coloration similar to a tiger (both are striped). However, where a tiger are is striped in black and orange, the kirre is striped in brown and grey. This coloration is consistent all over the kirre's body, with the exception of its face, which is all grey.",
					"Kirres are normally solitary creatures, until the approach of their mating season, at which time a male and female will join and produce offspring. Kirre litters number from three to five young. Kirres are mammals, and females produce milk for their young. Young kirres survive on milk for the first five months, at which point they begin to eat solid food such as small forest animals and other mammals.",
					"Kirre are a favorite game of many hunting tribes of races who live in the forests of Athas. The meat from kirres is some of the finest on all of Athas, and many seek after it. Aside from a source of food, the kirre also has other uses when killed. The creature's horns can be cut off and used as spearheads; in some cases, they can be carved into ornate daggers. In addition, the tail of a kirre has a sharp, bone spike at its end that can be fashioned into either an arrowhead or a dart."

At birth, a megapede is 20 to 30 feet long, growing to its full size within three months after birth. While not especially protective of its cocoon, a megapede, which has laid eggs, will fight off any creature that threatens them, mostly out of instinct."

					"Lore",
					"Long before luckless travelers in more remote and foreboding marshes see the harrowing sight of a lone night twist, they hear its haunting and melancholy song. The ghostly moaning sounds of its song seem slightly different to every traveler. For some, the song of the night twist sounds like a women weeping. To others, it is more akin to a wind blowing over a desolate graveyard. Most likely, the despair song of a night twist is the most sorrowful sound each traveler can conjurer within his or her own mind. Night twists subsist in the most inhospitable marshes, mudflats and ruins feeding on the rotting carcasses of creatures and travelers attracted by its despair song.",
					"Night Twist grow on cursed ground, defiled lands and battlefield, feeding of the lasting negative energies running throught the land. They feed on necrotic energies, and as such are often mistaken for Trees of Death. This mistake is often the last one made.",
					"Encounter",
					"Rangers of the tablelands have heard and felt the despair song of night twists coming from the Black Sands region. These night twists watch over the unplundered tombs, buried deep in the land in ancient times. Much older night twists can be found throughout the Dry Marsh and the Crescent Forest, taking root in and around the cyclopean ruins of fallen giant cities, their songs of despair luring explorers to a swift doom.",
					"A night twist, when actively seeking victims, sends out its despair song in order to bring prey to it. When those lured by the song are within range, a night twist uses its phantasmal killer spell-like ability. A night twist employs its powerful slam attack only if opponents first survive the illusion. The creature uses its entangle and darkness spell-like abilities to keep opponents from escaping. When a night twist feels threatened, it uses its wind attack and fear spelllike ability."

A heal spell or more powerful magic cast while the subject is in the throes of a nightmare is the only way to remove a night twist's death curse. If the victim of a night twist victim dies and is interred, a new night twist springs from where the corpse was laid one month later.

These horrors are a cancer on the world, their noxious presence poisoning land and contaminating water. Creatures indigenous to the haunts of a nightmare beast sicken and die, if they aren't devoured first. Killing one of these monsters does little to remove its stain. The hulking corpse rapidly rots into bubbling bile that renders the area uninhabitable.",

This monster has no interest in treasure, nor does it often bring any prey back to its lair, unless the kill is so large that it cannot be consumed all at once. A nightmare beast often inadvertently eats treasures along with their owners, so occasionally items of value turn up in the creature's lair at a later time. Nightmare beasts speak Abyssal.",

No other creature is willing or able to cooperate for any period of time with a fully manifested nightmare beast.",

					"Few if any people currently living on Athas know the truth about nightmare beasts. The commonly held theories of the beasts, their origins, and their life cycle are wrong. Each nightmare beast was once another, more mundane predator of the wastelands. In rare instances, as an animal consumes prey within areas connected to the Gray or imbued with substantial defiling magic, the creature slowly begins to change. Energy courses through it, causing it to grow and to develop a limitless hatred for all living things. Once the tainted creature begins to seek and consume sentient beings, it mutates into a nightmare beast.",
					"Nightmare beast spawn aren't progeny - they are a stage of mutation that some creatures reach before full metamorphosis is achieved.",
					"This, of course, leads to other questions: Why do these creatures all mutate into the same form? Do other, related mutations haunt the farthest reaches of the wastes?",
					"Info",
					"A maw of gladius-sized teeth splits a hulking form covered in armored scales. Tusks as sharp and numerous as the spears of a phalanx sprout from this opening. A nightmare beast stands at least 20 feet tall on its four legs. Each of its digits is tipped with a 3-foot-long claw. Its jaws are filled with 1-foot-long teeth and flanked by curved tusks the size of cavalry lances. A nightmare beast's thick, tough hide is typically dark gray with dark blue, purple, or brown splotches in between patches of bony material. Its red eyes, each the size of a man's head, glow in the dark. The nightmare beast prefers to lair in a remote cave. It spends most of its time in search of food, and it tends to hunt in one area until the food supply is exhausted. At that point, it usually hibernates for up to one year, then awakens again in a ravenous state. Surely nothing so nightmarish could be a living being-and yet it is. The nightmare beast is always ravenous, a mobile source of carnage. The more the beast's hunger is frustrated, the greater the frenzy of its attacks.",
					"Hatred consumes a nightmare beast - only through supreme willpower does it resist its brutish impulses. When possessed of its full faculties, the beast torments its enemies, sending them into nightmare-filled slumber. While its victim thrashes, the beast appears at its side where it can sample the horror firsthand. If a nightmare beast becomes injured, all thought of toying with its enemies vanishes. Its barely contained monstrous nature surges to the fore. Roaring with rage, it rises up on its hind legs, savagely slashing, impaling, and destroying its enemies. The putrid essence of a nightmare beast taints everything around it when the beast dies. At the Dungeon Master's option, the area within 30ft of a slain nightmare beast becomes defiled terrain."

No matter where they make their lairs, nightmare beasts do so in a consistent manner. All beast lairs are very defensible and well protected.

					"Fallen Sphinxes, whether through the weariness of the ages, corrupted by the slaughter of innocents, or dreams of worship by supplicants that attempt to bargain their way to knowledge, protosphinxes broke free of their divine command. Once freed of their servitude to the forgotten gods of Athas many sphinxs became protosphinx, abandoning their divine mission to become above all else, aggressive and animalistic creatures who lives up to the vicious reputation of their patron animal, the large and violent crocodile.",
					"However, even if a sphinx's alignment and loyalties drift in this way, it never leaves the place it guards or grants its secrets to any except creatures it deem's worthy. Despite their feral appearances and their obvious cruelty protosphinxes are clever manipulators that still obey to old divine laws. They follow the tradition of magical tests, expecting the failure of the contestant and an easy meal. However, they always make sure that one of them escape alive so the tell of their buried treasure keeps spreading and food keeps coming.",
					"In some reagions of the desert they are seen as cruel but benevolent patron, protecting a community and helping it prosper with its magic in exchange of frequent and bloody sacrifices.",
					"Some protosphinx are plainly mad, vicious creatures that do not obey any of their specie's dogma. These sphinxes are the ones that have been played by explorers and adventurers, cheated of their treasure or secrets in a deceitful way. They succumb to madness without the support of their deity and quickly after transform into a protosphinx, only driven by vengeance. The only way to appease the monster is to retrieve its treasure or to make sure its secret is safe once again.",
					"Encounter",
					"Protosphinxes can be found all over Athas, guarding forgotten temples where no worship has been uttered in millenias, watching over treasure rooms in lost cities. The Tablelands are famous for the high number of ruins that can be found there, and therefor protosphinxes are more common in this region. The south of the Great Alluvial Sand Wastes, getween the Giant's Ribs Mountains and the Screaming Ravine is known to be the home of at least two of this monstrosity, but none has been brave enough to follow the creatures to their lair and discover what could have spawn two of them.",
					"The most famous of the protosphinx is certainly Munakhtmou, lurking in the ruins of Balshara, at the foot of the Black Spine Mountains. Munakhtmou is known to keep no treasure or secret, but instead receive the worship of a growing community of escaped slaves, nomads and sheperds. The sphinx receives the sacrifices of intelligent humanoid and in exchange uses his magic to fertilise the land and defend the community against raiders and slavers."

					"The rakshasa employs delicacy and misdirection in its pursuit of dominion over others. Few creatures ever see the fiend in its true form, for it can take on any guise it wants, although it prefers to masquerade as someone powerful or influential: a noble, cardinal, or rich merchant, for example. A rakshasa's true form combines the features of a human and a tiger, with one noteworthy deformity: its palms are where the backs of the hands would be on a human.",
					"Rakshasas originated long ago in the Nine Hells, when powerful devils created a dark ritual to free their essence from their fiendish bodies in order to escape the Lower Planes. A rakshasa enters the Material Plane to feed its appetite for humanoid flesh and evil schemes. It selects its prey with care, taking pains to keep its presence in the world a secret.",
					"For a rakshasa, death on the Material Plane means an agonizing and torturous return to the Nine Hells, where its essence remains trapped until its body reforms - a process that cart take months or years. When the rakshasa is reborn, it has all the memories and knowledge of its former life, and it seeks retribution against the one who slew it. If the target has somehow slipped through its grasp, the rakshasa might punish its killer's family, friends, or descendants. Like devils, rakshasas killed in the Nine Hells are forever destroyed.",
					"Encounter",
					"Mountains of the Teeth: A low range of dry, knife-edged peaks, the Mountains of the Teeth are home to hostile tribes of tareks and minotaurs. The mountains also hide several mysterious, ancient monasteries the strongholds of rakshasa princes. Ranging out from these isolated retreats, rakshasa spies roam the Tyr Region, secretly plotting to turn the sorcerer-kings against one another and enslave the city-states.",
					"Rising out of the dust like the shattered fang of an enormous beast, Roqom appears only at the peak of midday on the hottest days of the year. This sharp, jagged spire of basalt lies in the wilderness beyond the Beastbarrens, but according to legend, it appears wherever its master can work the greatest mischief. The master of Roqom is Fajjayad, a great rakshasa prince, and he occasionally uses magical sendings tolure silt sailors and travelers to his black palace especiallytravelers who have a desperate need of some sort. Fajjayad claims to be able to provide for any such needs in exchange for services to be rendered within 1,001 days. The rakshasa is unfailingly polite and candid. If asked, he freely admits that the task he sets is likely to be difficult, even deadly, and that his \"clients\" might die while attempting it. However, Fajjayad assures them that \"the laws\" (a term he does not define) forbid him from setting a task that is impossible or whose outcome is certain death. For his magic to work, the task must have an element of chance and uncertainty. Still, if any group has ever profited from Fajjayad's bargain, its tale is not known.",
					"Info",
					"Rakshasa ruhk, or knights, are the warrior of their people, protecting rajah nobles and hunting heroes and good hearted individuals opposing the plots of rakshasa princes. They like to play with their prey before giving them the final blow and are cruel creatures, though not as manipulative as the rest of their kind, they are clever tacticians and are not above using ruse to trick their quarry into a disadvantageous situation. Ruhks are very confident warriors, sure of their abilities and certain that their natural immunities give them domination over any mortal warrior."

					"Rakshasa society is bound by rigid castes. Each rakshasa is born into a particular role in life and cannot advance. Females (known as rakshasi) are fit to be consorts, honored only by their faithfulness and the fighting ability of their children. There are 2 to 3 females per male. Rakshasa society is led by a rajah or maharajah, whose commands are to be obeyed without question. Rakshasas wage war on humanity constantly, not only to feed themselves but because they believe that battle is the only way to gain honor. If confronted by humans who recognize their true appearance, they are insufferably arrogant. A rakshasa's life varies in cycles of wild self-indulgence in times of prosperity and strict fasting and sacrifice in times of trouble or before battle. They are honorable creatures but will twist the wording of an agreement to suit their purposes. They prefer to deal with humanity by using their illusion powers to deceive and manipulate them, but are brave and forthright in battle."

					"Ak'chazar rakshasas wander the planes seeking new lands to subjugate and new undead minions to enslave. These rakshasas are masters of necromantic magic, although they are powerful in the other schools of magic as well. Ak'chazar rakshasas typically work behind the scenes, manipulating events to suit their dark whims and relying on their web of spies, assassins, and intelligent undead to carry out their nefarious plots. Ak'chazar rakshasas do associate with other rakshasas, often as leaders or manipulators. Other types of rakshasas value an ak'chazar's intelligence even as they fear its abilities. It is not uncommon for weaker rakshasas to follow the complex plans of an ak'chazar even as they go about their own missions. All rakshasas tend toward solitary existences, but communication and coordination between the various kinds is not unheard of.",
					"An ak'chazar rakshasa typically establishes a power base at the site of a great battle, a city of the dead, or some other place where a large number of corpses might be interred. It uses its power over undead to create several intelligent undead minions. Thereafter, it might make contact with a local underworld organization (almost always through intermediaries) or even a corrupt or power-hungry political official.",
					"It will play with these leaders, offering them advice, power, or riches as it learns their habits and defining characteristics. Then the ak'chazar uses its magic jar spell-like ability to replace one of these leaders for a time, using the borrowed body to solidify its hold on the region.",
					"Several of the House Tsalaxa high officials are actually ak'chazar rakshasas. They sequester themselves in foreboding strongholds or warehouses hidden in the waste, although some have made lairs closer to the heart of civilization in the city states. At least one ak'chazar rakshasa operates from within Balic, lending his services and undead minions in exchange for special favors too terrible to ponder."

While this physical feature doesn't detract from the creature's manual dexterity, it makes a rakshasa look very disturbing to those unfamiliar with the creature. Naztharune rakshasas, like most rakshasas, tend to be solitary creatures but will work with other rakshasas when necessary and even team up with other naztharunes on a continuing basis.",
					"They sometimes work as infiltrators and spies for ak'chazar rakshasas, and they sometimes hire themselves out to other creatures as mercenaries or assassins. Naztharune rakshasas have a hearty contempt for all creatures except other rakshasas, but they can suppress this feeling when it profits them to do so. Unlike most of their rakshasa brethren, naztharune rakshasas feel less of a need to be \"the boss\" in every operation. They are much more mercenary in their desires and needs.",
					"Most naztharune rakshasas serve the ak'chazar and rajah rakshasas as spies and assassins. A pair of ak'chazar rakshasas operating in Raam has sent naztharune agents to stir up unrest in neighboring cities-states, most notably in Urik, Raj, and Tyr. These naztharune rakshasas have already compromised several local guilds and eliminated key politicians and merchants in an attempt to turn the cities' hatred of one another into open war. Naztharune rakshasas have also been encountered in cities as far south as Balic, in some cases pursuing their own agendas."

					"Scrabs are small, three-sectioned, insect-like men who live in nests in the desert. They are highly intelligent, and some of them are even able to cast spells. No small group of travellers is safe in the vicinity of a scrab nest.",
					"Scrabs live in the sandy wastes, or in the sandy areas of the rocky barrens. They need little water, perhaps 1/20th of what a human needs. Scrabs also seem to get all of the liquid they need from the blood of their victims. A scrab's niche in the environment is strictly that of a predator, although scrabs are also preyed upon by the larger creatures that inhabit the wastes.",
					"Scrabs live in large nests tunnelled under the sand. They produce a spittle that solidifies the sand. Because of the ever-present sandstorms, the scrab nest is usually located 15 feet under the surface. If available, a rocky outcropping is used to hide and protect the entrance. Scrabs are excellent tunnellers, and if the nest collapses on them they just dig it out again. A scrab can hold its breath for up to an hour under sand and even gets a bit of air from the surrounding sand. This is due to the long gills through which scrabs breath. These gills are located all along the grooves in their shells."

					"Athas's spiders regard other creatures as food, and they establish lairs in territory through which easy prey passes.

					"Light gleams from its crystalline carapace, casting a riot of colors across a cliff face. The crystal spider is one of the Tablelands' most alluring and menacing arachnids. Its spare frame and delicate movements are gracious and attractive, while its crimson eyes and slender, venomous fangs radiate danger.",
					"Resembling giant wolf spiders, crystal spiders have bodies composed of multifaceted crystal that creates dazzling patterns of refracted light. They spin glass webs that are very sharp and can focus a damaging beam of light at a potential victim. The crystal spider is a beautiful creature. During the day the sunlight refracts through it, reflecting a myriad of colors which change as it moves. At night it reflects any ambient light, retaining its colors but not as radiant as during the day. When the spider has fed, it takes on a reddish tinge but this fades over a few days. A crystal spider is incapable of making sounds, but can communicate with others of its kind by means of controlled light. Crystal spiders get most of their nutrients from sunlight but do require liquids to survive, preferring human blood. They are hunted for their webs, which make excellent weapons, and for the gems which they instinctively weave into these webs (although the spiders are themselves unaware of their value).",
					"A typical crystal spider is eight feet long and can live up to 150 years. Before death, a crystal spider will lay a single huge cluster of eggs (as many as 200) in a specially crafted web.",
					"A crystal spider is patient and agile. Its glass webs can slice through bone, and the spider spins them in dim light along the travel route through its lair. The arachnid creeps behind prey, attacking with teeth and razor-sharp legs the moment a creature stumbles into a web. A crystal spider quickly withdraws, only to appear elsewhere in a blinding blaze of light."

Ssurran born in Sess'inek's image are larger and more cunning than other ssurran, and are thoroughly evil. These lizard kings and queens dominate ssurran tribes, usurping a shaman's authority and inspiring uncharacteristic aggression among their subjects."

Victorious ssurrans have been known to strip the corpses of the fallen, scarring or otherwise marking the dead as food, for later consumption. Ssurrans strike with dreadfully sharp claws and a savage, snapping bite. Those of a more civilized bent arm themselves with whatever weapons they can find and deal solid, brutal blows with these. Impalers, macahuitl and spears are all popular arms with the ssurrans.",
					"Ssurrans Poison Dusk",
					"While smaller than their ssurran cousins, the poison dusk ssurran are just as dangerous when provoked. Poison Dusk mostly live in the jungles of the Forest Ridge, past the Ringing Mountains where they hunt halflings, or in the lush region of the Crescent Forest between Nibenay and Gulg. A poison dusk ssurran is between 3 to 4 feet in height, weighing 42-52 pounds. Its tail is 2 to 3 feet long, and its scales shift color with its mood. The eyes of a poison dusk ssurran are larger than those of the other species, and males have a crest running down the back of the head that can lie flat or extend based on mood.",
					"While they still shun armor, they have adopted the use of swords and bows, which are superior to the clubs and javelins used by the sandscales and the blackscale lizardfolk. While the poison dusks consider themselves to be the superior breed of ssurran, they are whilling to work with other breed of ssurran on some occasions. The poison dusks generally avoid other lizardfolk, except when they travel for religious ceremonies or to offer tribute to a stronger tribe. They are nomadic by nature and rarely stay in one area for more than a few months. The areas inhabited by the humans include many of the lands once frequented by these traveling nomads, and this is a major cause of the friction between the two species.",
					"Info",
					"Found in the deepest part of a devastated jungle or isolated defiled area, the poison dusk defilers are shunned by their own kind. This devilish ssurran bear the corruption of the demon lord Sess'inek's in their veins and use it for personal power. This poison dusk have a gigantic ego, seeing themselves as the evolutionary next step of their species. They capture other poison dusk and submit them to monstrous magic experimentation, twisting their flesh in horrid ways. Still its undeniable the vile mind of the defiler is gifted for poisonous concoctions. They sometime sell their creation against services to other evil intelligent creature and plot with demons to acquire more power."

					"The nomadic ssurrans, also called sandscale lizard folk, traverse the blistering desert sands in loose tribes. The ssurrans are tribal in nature, roaming in groups of related families. At times these groups can dwindle in size, particularly after a lean spell, but tribes have also been known to band together for common purpose, forming vast hordes that last for as long as need or firm leadership binds them. The harsh conditions of life on Athas have driven many ssurrans to live the lives of raiders, taking by force what they cannot gain by other means. Some groups hunt while others raid settlements. They allow inhabitants to flee, and kill only those who resist. The ever-practical ssurrans then strip a village of its usable goods and move on. The tribe's hunters follow behind, clearing away signs of their passage and laying false trails.",
					"The more fortunate and enterprising tribes have turned to trade as a way of life, forging more productive relationships with the other peoples of their region. Whatever their major pastime, all ssurran tribes are natural scavengers and hunter-gatherers. Ssurrans rarely live outside a tribe. On rare occasion, a ssurran wanders alone, either as an outcast or the last of its tribe. Sometimes, slavers capture young ssurrans to sell in city-states as exotic merchandise. Ssurrans are hunted for their young by some. Ssurrans raised from the egg can be trained as guards, scouts, and gladiators, and are valued in the city-states of the south. Ssurrans are strict carnivores, and some of their kind are reported to enjoy the flavor of halfling flesh over others (apparently they find it soft and sweet, but with a piquant after-taste...).",

These reptilian humanoids roam the Tablelands, trading, raiding and hunting that which does not hunt them. Standing up to 6 feet tall, they are a hardy species that have adapted to deal with Athas' unforgiving climate. In the region of the Scorched Plateau, their natural resistance to extremes of heat has allowed them to stake their claim over the immediate environs of Lava Gorge, where the majority of other races simply cannot venture. Ruled over by their priests, ssurrans hold ancient beliefs in strange gods and have a reputation for barbarism that is perhaps a little undeserved.",

					"Ssurrans are hardy reptilian humanoids",
					"that live and hunt under the blazing sun. Like other Athasians, a ssurran's day-to-day goal is survival.",
					"Lore",
					"The nomadic ssurrans, also called sandscale lizard folk, traverse the blistering desert sands in loose tribes. The ssurrans are tribal in nature, roaming in groups of related families. At times these groups can dwindle in size, particularly after a lean spell, but tribes have also been known to band together for common purpose, forming vast hordes that last for as long as need or firm leadership binds them. The harsh conditions of life on Athas have driven many ssurrans to live the lives of raiders, taking by force what they cannot gain by other means. Some groups hunt while others raid settlements. They allow inhabitants to flee, and kill only those who resist. The ever-practical ssurrans then strip a village of its usable goods and move on. The tribe's hunters follow behind, clearing away signs of their passage and laying false trails.",
					"The more fortunate and enterprising tribes have turned to trade as a way of life, forging more productive relationships with the other peoples of their region. Whatever their major pastime, all ssurran tribes are natural scavengers and hunter-gatherers. Ssurrans rarely live outside a tribe. On rare occasion, a ssurran wanders alone, either as an outcast or the last of its tribe. Sometimes, slavers capture young ssurrans to sell in city-states as exotic merchandise. Ssurrans are hunted for their young by some. Ssurrans raised from the egg can be trained as guards, scouts, and gladiators, and are valued in the city-states of the south. Ssurrans are strict carnivores, and some of their kind are reported to enjoy the flavor of halfling flesh over others (apparently they find it soft and sweet, but with a piquant after-taste...).",
					"Encounters",
					"A typical ssurran is laden down under patchwork armor, assorted bric-a-brac and battered trade goods, and armed with a bizarre assortment of weaponry from across the Tablelands. These reptilian humanoids roam the Tablelands, trading, raiding and hunting that which does not hunt them. Standing up to 6 feet tall, they are a hardy species that have adapted to deal with Athas' unforgiving climate. In the region of the Scorched Plateau, their natural resistance to extremes of heat has allowed them to stake their claim over the immediate environs of Lava Gorge, where the majority of other races simply cannot venture. Ruled over by their priests, ssurrans hold ancient beliefs in strange gods and have a reputation for barbarism that is perhaps a little undeserved.",
					"When it comes to battle, ssurrans are vicious, disorganized and somewhat cowardly. They prefer to maneuver their opponents into positions of disadvantage and will strike from ambush whenever possible. Ssurrans would rather attack with superior numbers and have been known to flee from battles that they might have won simply because they have believed themselves to be outnumbered. For the ssurrans, the ideal battle is one where you and a large amount of your fellows strike from ambush, surprise the foe and over-run him with sheer numbers. Victorious ssurrans have been known to strip the corpses of the fallen, scarring or otherwise marking the dead as food, for later consumption. Ssurrans strike with dreadfully sharp claws and a savage, snapping bite. Those of a more civilized bent arm themselves with whatever weapons they can find and deal solid, brutal blows with these. Impalers, macahuitl and spears are all popular arms with the ssurrans.",
					"Ssurrans Blackscale",
					"Like their smaller cousins, blackscale ssurran are primitive reptilian humanoids that can be very dangerous if provoked. A blackscale lizardfolk is usually 8-1/2 to 9-1/2 feet tall, and weighs about 600 pounds. Its tail is 4 to 5 feet long.",
					"Blackscale ssurran are proud and fierce fighters, concerned with heroic action and personal glory. Left on their own, they will fight as disorganized individuals, but their leaders can force them to work together for short periods of time. The blackscales have little patience for tricks and traps, considering such tools to be the trade of lesser ssurran. They are proud and arrogant, and are usually extremely hostile toward humans who trespass into the deep deserts where they live. While their culture is quite primitive, the black scales have access to the vaults and arsenals of ancient cities. High-ranking warriors or priests wear glittering bone and primitive ornaments, and the weapons of the blackscales are often elaborately carved and decorated.",
					"The blackscales typically live off the \"tribute\" they extract from the other tribes and merchant house offerings made to prevent them from raiding trade routes. The war priests hold the ultimate authority within society but rarely use this power; in the absence of interference from a priest, the most powerful warrior rules the tribe. Any of the three species of ssurran can be called to serve as a priests; the blackscales consider the priests to be chosen ones, and thus see no shame in following their commands.",
					"Info",
					"Once in a generation a blackscale is born with tremendous strength, ferocity and evil in its heart. These fearsome creatures are touched by the demon lord Sess'inek's and gifted with demonic might. They soon take control of their tribe and quickly conquer other lesser ssurran tribe. Once they have gathered enough members they begin a campaign of slaughter and terror against other intelligent races. If left uncheck these tribe of ssurran can grow in numbers and even pose a threat to the city-states. In combat the blackscale warlord is rushing in the melee, killing everything that crosses his path."

					"Ruins litter the Tyr Region, each speaking to a society lost to calamity, war, or plague. The town of Gerot, nestled beneath a mountain range northeast of Raam, met with a particularly unpalatable end. According to legend, Gerot's people were great warriors, haughty and proud. They impressed Grand Vizier Abalach-Re, who offered the mountain community an alliance if its fighters would join Raam's legions. In their arrogance, the Gerotians declined, and they killed Abalach-Re's envoys. Enraged, the sorcerer-queen unleashed a vicious curse against Gerot's populace. The townsfolk were struck with an unquenchable thirst. The twisted brilliance behind her curse was that life-sustaining, pure water would bring death to any Gerotian. Within days, the entire town had died. What Abalach-Re hadn't expected was that every cursed Gerotian would rise in undeath, becoming the first thraxes.",

					"Insatiable thirst drives a thrax to hunt the living. The water vampire extracts fluids from the flesh of its victims. It's said to be an agonizing death. The distinctive cadavers are clearly the work of a thrax. Fearing retribution, the undead predator flees. A thrax wanders alone in parched misery. It loathes the monster it has become, but it cannot stop; its thirst is unbearable. Some thraxes seek revenge on Abalach-Re, and they haunt Raam and drink the sorcerer-queen's supporters dry. Because the corpse of a thrax victim is so easily recognized, few thrax live in cities or villages. Instead, they haunt the wastelands, oasis, and trade routes.",

					"Victims of an ancient curse, thrax are wretched creatures that can only survive by draining water from the bodies of others, leaving them desiccated corpses. A thrax's appearance is very different than what it was before \"the change.\" Its hair darkens and its skin takes on a ruddy tinge. Its facial features develop a gaunt, angular cast and its eyes become a deep blue. The most striking change is in its hands. Each of the thrax's fingers grows a circular \"sucker\" through which it drains water from its victims."

He may never accuse, judge, or pardon another templar who is of equal or higher level. The templar hierarchy is measured strictly by experience level. A templar of higher level can negate any action taken by one of lower level (prevent the requisitioning of money or troops, release accused prisoners, etc.). Templars of the same level who disagree must seek out someone of higher level within the hierarchy to arbitrate their differences. They never receive official approval to establish religious stronghold a sorcerer-king's life revolves around his one city and, while that may expand, he will never open branch areas that he cannot control."

Templars perform three vital functions within a given city state. Primarily, they comprise the city guards and officers of the sorcerer-king's armies. Secondly, they see to it that the city is administered, its businesses kept running, and its slaves fed. Finally, the templars are responsible for maintaining the illusion that the sorcerer-king is a god they have absolute power to enforce worship and homage to the sorcerer-kings. Every templar NPC will be actively pursuing one of these functions. One final, unwritten function of the templars is to advance through their ranks as rapidly as possible.

Ranked templars (levels 5-8) gain greater responsibilities and may have several lower- ranked templars beneath them. High- Ranked templars (levels 9 and higher) move into management of the city state such templars are difficult to unseat, since they can blame nearly any shortcomings on their underlings.",
					"These are only a sampling of the many levels of templar bureaucracy. Advancement through the ranks has little to do with ability or experience. Technically, the sorcerer-king is a god within his own city and the templars assure him of worship and obedience. In actuality, a sorcerer-king is not a god or a demigod, though he is generally an extremely powerful wizard and psionicist. However, the templars erect temples and subjugate the populations to worship him. There isn't a noble, merchant, or peasant in a city state who doesn't at least pay lip service to the sorcerer-king or the templars who enforce his will.",
					"The DM must keep two things in mind when dealing with any particular templar NPC. First, how will the templar attempt to use the player characters to gain advantage? He could accuse or imprison them, which always looks good in the eyes of a superior, or he could buy their services to perform a task suck as assassination or simply making a superior look bad. Second, the DM must consider how the player characters might appeal to the templar's wicked ways and greed. In their quest for power, they are sometimes easily manipulated.

Warriors hold power, and their vaunted status is something all aspire to attain. When not waging war against Raam or defending their home from reprisals or conquest, Draji raiders prowl the surrounding wastes, plundering villages for fresh slaves to replace those expended in labor or sacrifice.",

					"These soldiers protect the Father and Master Temple, the immense pyramid from which the sorcerer-king runs the city-state. Draji respect strength and ruthlessness, qualities personified by their warriors. The jasuan knights, named for Tectuktitlay's beloved pet drakes, embody these principles. Jasuan knights are warriors born into one of the city's heroic clans, the descendants of great Draji heroes of long ago. Unlike the nobles of other city-states, Draji nobles aren't necessarily wealthy landowners. Their riches lie in their membership in the city's foremost clans, and their trade is war. Each noble clan claims the allegiance of certain artisan or merchant clans. Warriors of these lower clans are bound to \"their\" jasuans and fight under their command."

Gulg does not have a landed nobility in the same manner as other city-states; agriculture is not prevalent, so owning property is not a sign of wealth. Instead, the noble class of Gulg is a meritocracy of hunters. The judagas warriors also serve as the heart of the army, although Gulg rarely goes to war openly. The term \"judaga\" means \"headhunter\" and refers to the hunters' practice of taking the heads of their enemies as trophies. They know a ritual that can trap the soul of a deceased warrior in its own skull, and the dagadas of the greatest hunters are adorned with such undead guardians. Judagas have no land or titles to pass on to their descendants, but they compete fiercely for trophies and rich spoils to buy wives, slaves, livestock, and houses full of luxuries that their families can enjoy for generations. A prominent judaga's family remains wealthy and influential long after the individual's death, and young hunters descended from renowned judagas are likely to become judagas themselves."

Amenakst are proficient in the art of war and magic, wielding spells and bronze weapons against the enemies of Raam and waging war against the looting parties of Draj and war-band of Urich. They are renowned for the deadly arcane bows they fire while mounted on crodlu's back and their terrifying helmet mimicking the head of a cobra, hyena, vulture, or other dangerous desert creatures."

Not surprisingly, templars tend to abuse the powers they have for their own personal gain which, so long as the city is administered and kept in order, does not bother the sorcerer-king. Templars perform three vital functions within a given city state. Primarily, they comprise the city guards and officers of the sorcerer-king's armies. Secondly, they see to it that the city is administered, its businesses kept running, and its slaves fed. Finally, the templars are responsible for maintaining the illusion that the sorcerer-king is a god they have absolute power to enforce worship and homage to the sorcerer-kings. Every templar NPC will be actively pursuing one of these functions. One final, unwritten function of the templars is to advance through their ranks as rapidly as possible. The means by which a templar might gain power and position are wide open, including bribery, theft, and even assassination of others within their ranks. Every templar NPC can be counted on to accept underhanded schemes that will help him rise to power among his fellows.",
					"In the administration of the city states, templar NPCs occupy all positions from waste removal to the mayorship. Lower-Ranked templars (levels 1-4) are given the dirtier jobs tkat require hands-on work, having a few guards at their disposal and fewer slave laborers than tkey need to perform their tasks effectively. Ranked templars (levels 5-8) gain greater responsibilities and may have several lower- ranked templars beneath them. High- Ranked templars (levels 9 and higher) move into management of the city state such templars are difficult to unseat, since they can blame nearly any shortcomings on their underlings.",
					"These are only a sampling of the many levels of templar bureaucracy. Advancement through the ranks has little to do with ability or experience. Technically, the sorcerer-king is a god within his own city and the templars assure him of worship and obedience. In actuality, a sorcerer-king is not a god or a demigod, though he is generally an extremely powerful wizard and psionicist. However, the templars erect temples and subjugate the populations to worship him. There isn't a noble, merchant, or peasant in a city state who doesn't at least pay lip service to the sorcerer-king or the templars who enforce his will.",
					"The DM must keep two things in mind when dealing with any particular templar NPC. First, how will the templar attempt to use the player characters to gain advantage? He could accuse or imprison them, which always looks good in the eyes of a superior, or he could buy their services to perform a task suck as assassination or simply making a superior look bad. Second, the DM must consider how the player characters might appeal to the templar's wicked ways and greed. In their quest for power, they are sometimes easily manipulated.

Raam's templars are not bureaucrats; the city-state has many ranks of officials that oversee civil administration.

Like the mansabdars, they are an arm of the civic government, loosely overseen by the templars. Little better than assassins, the kuotagha hide among the populace, striking without warning to eliminate undesirables. The high kuotaghas are the sorcerer-queen's most trusted and deadly servants. Like Abalach·Re, a high kuotagha looks weak, decadent, and unarmed. Once an enemy draws near, the assassin's body hardens, its claws extend, and its arm tendons detach from its biceps to form flexible bands. Given the malfeasance of the mansabdars and the breakdown of templar authority, Abalach-Re relies more and more on the kuotagh to enforce her will."

					"The iron guards are the chosen templar's of Kalak, the symbol of Tyr military might. They are equipped with the best iron weapons and armors that the city can provide, and officers often wield rare magic weapons coming from Kalak's vault. In Tyr, they represent the highest form of authority and are the trusted servants of the sorcerer-king. Due to the impracticality of metal armors under the searing sun of Athas, members of the iron guard seldom wear their iron armors during peaceful time, usually switching it for studded leather. Kalak gifted his Templars with powerful magic to complete their martial skills, few can stand their ground against a single iron guard but only an army can expect to overcome a unit of this fighters, boosting each other with their magic and empowering their strikes with deadly effects."

Not surprisingly, templars tend to abuse the powers they have for their own personal gain which, so long as the city is administered and kept in order, does not bother the sorcerer-king. Templars perform three vital functions within a given city state. Primarily, they comprise the city guards and officers of the sorcerer-king's armies. Secondly, they see to it that the city is administered, its businesses kept running, and its slaves fed. Finally, the templars are responsible for maintaining the illusion that the sorcerer-king is a god they have absolute power to enforce worship and homage to the sorcerer-kings. Every templar NPC will be actively pursuing one of these functions. One final, unwritten function of the templars is to advance through their ranks as rapidly as possible. The means by which a templar might gain power and position are wide open, including bribery, theft, and even assassination of others within their ranks. Every templar NPC can be counted on to accept underhanded schemes that will help him rise to power among his fellows.",
					"In the administration of the city states, templar NPCs occupy all positions from waste removal to the mayorship. Lower-Ranked templars (levels 1-4) are given the dirtier jobs tkat require hands-on work, having a few guards at their disposal and fewer slave laborers than tkey need to perform their tasks effectively. Ranked templars (levels 5-8) gain greater responsibilities and may have several lower- ranked templars beneath them. High- Ranked templars (levels 9 and higher) move into management of the city state such templars are difficult to unseat, since they can blame nearly any shortcomings on their underlings.",
					"These are only a sampling of the many levels of templar bureaucracy. Advancement through the ranks has little to do with ability or experience. Technically, the sorcerer-king is a god within his own city and the templars assure him of worship and obedience. In actuality, a sorcerer-king is not a god or a demigod, though he is generally an extremely powerful wizard and psionicist. However, the templars erect temples and subjugate the populations to worship him. There isn't a noble, merchant, or peasant in a city state who doesn't at least pay lip service to the sorcerer-king or the templars who enforce his will.",
					"The DM must keep two things in mind when dealing with any particular templar NPC. First, how will the templar attempt to use the player characters to gain advantage? He could accuse or imprison them, which always looks good in the eyes of a superior, or he could buy their services to perform a task suck as assassination or simply making a superior look bad. Second, the DM must consider how the player characters might appeal to the templar's wicked ways and greed. In their quest for power, they are sometimes easily manipulated.

When an influencial noble displeases King Kalak, when a powerful Templar fall out of the king's grace, the sorcerer-king send one or several alkatesh to take care of the problem. The rumor is that the alkatesh pale complexion come from the fact that they spend most of their time in the Under-Tyr or even lower in the belly of the earth. They are able to see without light and their eyes are colorless and veiled. They live their lives in toxic caves, forgotten temples or endless underground maze, walking them silently until they hear the summoning of the king. Few know how Kalak's gained the loyalty of this corrupted beings, but many connect their first appearance with the beginning of the construction of Kalak's Ziggurat. Alkatesh live out of the templar's structure, they do not hold real political power in Tyr and are unfit to take any official position."

Only outmatched by the Lions of Urich, who often come from their ranks, the uratuan knights are the elite units that always occupied the center of the battlefield. Wielding obsidian weapons and brass armors the uratuan knights are often called the \"brass guard\" by the Urikites, but they still wear the yellow cloaks of the Templars."

They watch carefuly for any sign of illegal use of magic and make sure the mages are punished for their transgression, usually put to death on the spot. Hamanu tought his warriors how to use the magical powers he grants them to protect themselves from magical attack and how to disturb spellcasters on the battlefield. To win their title the Lions must kill in single combat one of the great lions of the arena, they usually keep on their person a token of this victory, integrating it on their armor.

					"The thri-kreen wander the deserts and savannas of the Athas, avoiding all other races. Thri-kreen employ a language without words. To show emotion and reaction, a thri-kreen clacks its mandibles and waves its antennae, giving other thri-kreen a sense of what it is thinking and feeling. Other creatures find this manner of communication difficult to interpret and impossible to duplicate. When forced to interact with creatures of other intelligent species, thri-kreen employ alternative methods of communication, such as drawing pictures in sand or making pictures out of twigs or blades of grass.",
					"Thri-kreen experience the full range of emotions but aren't as prone to emotional outbursts as humans. Thri-kreen with psionic ability often demonstrate a wider range of emotions, particularly if they live near or interact with humans or other highly emotional creatures.",
					"Thri-kreen consider all other living creatures as potential nourishment, and they love the taste of elf flesh in particular. If a creature might be useful for something other than food, the thrikreen aren't likely to attack it on sight. Thri-kreen kill to survive, never for sport.",
					"Thri-kreen don't require sleep and can rest while remaining alert and performing light tasks. Their inability to sleep is thought to be the reason why thrikreen have such short lifespans, the average thri-kreen life expectancy being only thirty years.",
					"Thri-kreen bond with their clutch mates and greater pack. This cohesion amplifies their hunting and fighting prowess. Thri-kreen prefer to hunt nonsentient creatures, but they make exceptions in desperate times. They do not fight for vengeance; rather, they safeguard their freedom and attack only when threatened. Thri-kreen who stray from this norm are often under the influence of malevolent creatures or spirits.",
					"Shamanistic desert talkers lead the thri-kreen in rituals to connect with ancestral spirits. Each thri-kreen taps into the race's memory. Some ancient memories reveal that the thri-kreen once held a powerful empire of their own.",

Newborn thri-kreen fetch a high price because they'll bond with their primary caregiver and clutch mates, regardless of race.

					"Werehyenas are humanoids, often male humans, who can transform themselves into hyena-like forms. Their packs roam the plains and deserts of Athas looking for prey. The humanoid form tends to be tall and sinewy, with long, shaggy hair usually tied back over their neck. In their human forms, werehyenas tend to be gregarious and charismatic, many possessing a loud, resounding laugh.",
					"The canine form appears to be a large hyena, over 6 foot long from snout to tail, with golden fur on its back and black fur on its belly and feet. It is not uncommon for a pack of these creatures to be followed by 2-12 normal hyenas. The normal hyenas are attracted to the lycanthropes, although not under their direct control.",
					"Gnoll's of the Dragon Horns have a fragile alliance's with the local packs of werehyenas and the two species are often known to collaborate against common enemies. Werehyenas consider themselves superior to gnolls, treating them as the beta of the pack until dominance is asserted by the gnoll. While they do not necessarily respect the gnoll on their own, werehyena thread lightly when it comes to their demonic lord, Yeenoghu.",
					"Encounters",
					"Werehyenas travel in close-knit packs of up to a dozen creatures, most of whom are males. The pack is run by a dominant male, who makes all important decisions, reinforcing them with an occasional, savage bite. Newly infected lycanthropes are welcomed into a pack only if the newcomer agrees to accept the pack leader's orders to the death. If not, a fight for dominance usually ensues, with the victor becoming the new pack leader. Among themselves, they can be playful and capable of lasting intimacy. They mate for life, but only with other members of the pack. From one to four cubs are born with each litter; 75% of them are male.",
					"Werehyena packs scour the desert and plains in human form, seeking human settlements to infiltrate. A favorite ploy is for a single lycanthrope to enter a town or village and use its charm ability to win its way into the hearts of the people. Some are even known to shower gifts on a long-forgotten sister or relative. The gifts are typically small gems which it gathers for this purpose. The lycanthrope then lures the victim out of town to a trap, where the rest of the pack lies in wait.",
					"Info",
					"Werehyenas are covert hunters, preying on gullible humans whenever possible. However, like their normal cousins, they are excellent scavengers, capable of eating just about anything in order to survive. Although their numbers are great, they are too widely scattered to have any profound effect upon the ecology of Athas."

					"Lore",
					"Werehyenas are humanoids, often male humans, who can transform themselves into hyena-like forms. Their packs roam the plains and deserts of Athas looking for prey. The humanoid form tends to be tall and sinewy, with long, shaggy hair usually tied back over their neck. In their human forms, werehyenas tend to be gregarious and charismatic, many possessing a loud, resounding laugh.",
					"The canine form appears to be a large hyena, over 6 foot long from snout to tail, with golden fur on its back and black fur on its belly and feet. It is not uncommon for a pack of these creatures to be followed by 2-12 normal hyenas. The normal hyenas are attracted to the lycanthropes, although not under their direct control.",
					"Gnoll's of the Dragon Horns have a fragile alliance's with the local packs of werehyenas and the two species are often known to collaborate against common enemies. Werehyenas consider themselves superior to gnolls, treating them as the beta of the pack until dominance is asserted by the gnoll. While they do not necessarily respect the gnoll on their own, werehyena thread lightly when it comes to their demonic lord, Yeenoghu.",
					"Encounters",
					"Werehyenas travel in close-knit packs of up to a dozen creatures, most of whom are males. The pack is run by a dominant male, who makes all important decisions, reinforcing them with an occasional, savage bite. Newly infected lycanthropes are welcomed into a pack only if the newcomer agrees to accept the pack leader's orders to the death. If not, a fight for dominance usually ensues, with the victor becoming the new pack leader. Among themselves, they can be playful and capable of lasting intimacy. They mate for life, but only with other members of the pack. From one to four cubs are born with each litter; 75% of them are male.",
					"Werehyena packs scour the desert and plains in human form, seeking human settlements to infiltrate. A favorite ploy is for a single lycanthrope to enter a town or village and use its charm ability to win its way into the hearts of the people. Some are even known to shower gifts on a long-forgotten sister or relative. The gifts are typically small gems which it gathers for this purpose. The lycanthrope then lures the victim out of town to a trap, where the rest of the pack lies in wait.",
					"Info",
					"The leader of a werehyena stays in charge until it's too weak to lead and is killed by a younger, stronger pack member. The alpha is a cunning and cruel killer, ruling his pack with an iron fist. In combat the alpha is the first to leap in the melee and always the last to stand. Despite his predilection for violence the alpha prefer to attack when his pack has a strategic advantage and will make good use of cover, high ground and other possible edge. At the end of the hunt the alpha is always the first to choose his share of the kill."

Motivated by hunger for living souls and driven by the same desire for power that awakened them in undeath, some wights serve as shock troops for evil leaders, including wraiths. As soldiers, they are able to plan but seldom do so, relying on their hunger for destruction to overwhelm any creature that stands before them. Wights are unscrupulous about allies, although a habit of the creature's living existence might influence its associations. Some wights work with living allies whose pursuits parallel a wight's dark appetites. More commonly, wights abide the presence of predatory breasts, which don't see the undead creatures as food."
