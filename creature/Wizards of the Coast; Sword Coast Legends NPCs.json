She's wise, powerful, and experienced in battle tactics, and when the people she loves are threatened, there is little in this world that can withstand her fury.",

When not on the ready for imminent combat, however, she's ready to kick back and blow off steam with the rest of the hard-bitten warriors. She fights hard, and she plays hard, and woe be unto the poor soul who comments on the way she holds herself, the way she dresses, or the way she hefts her sword. As a dwarf who has faced down orc hordes, repelled incursions of giants, and even held fast against a dragon ambush, Jarhild doesn't feel a need to explain herself to anyone. She is who she is: a force to be reckoned with."
