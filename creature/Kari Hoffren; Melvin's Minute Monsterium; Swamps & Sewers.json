					"{@bold Thieves and Tormentors.} Bane bogies get their name from the persistent harassment they inflict upon the villages near their home. They steal things, break things and even kill livestock if they get the chance. Because of this, nearby villagers often send raiding parties to destroy the nests of bane bogies, which are usually located in old trees. Such forays often end badly, as the bogies know the swamps better than the backs of their hands and often create traps around their homes to ward of anyone trying to attack them. Also, whenever they are threatened, they will certainly use their biggest weapon: the {@creature utburd|TTT} (see this booklet)."
