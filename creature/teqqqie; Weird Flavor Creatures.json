Step on a fire slug, however, and you will soon find your feet covered in burns and blisters.",
					"Through an unknown process, these odd sea slugs produce intense heat. The reason for this is also uncertain, since, like many sea slugs, fire slugs are usually passive creatures, content to graze on seaweed and corals on reefs and near the shore.  However, when threatened, they have a slew of defensive abilities to protect their otherwise soft and vulnerable bodies. In addition to the extreme temperature they emit, their bodies are covered in special tentacles called cerata, which jet tiny flames from their tips. They also possess modified cerata with poison bulbs called cnidosacs on the ends. These tentacles, along with a toxic mucus coating, compensate for the slug's slow speed and squishy body.",
					"If you encounter one of these stunning creatures, it is best to admire its beauty from a distance; a fire slug's defenses are always active, and they are unsuitable for use as either pets or food. Some have tried to keep them in aquaria, but they have a reputation for melting through the glass or boiling other inhabitants alive, and their flesh is chewy and poisonous to most creatures."

					"Giant fire slugs, like many giant versions of creatures, are the subject of quite a bit of controversy in academic circles. Some scholars believe that they are the result of intentional or accidental magical modification. Others, especially certain circles of coastal druids, hold that these creatures have lived alongside their smaller relatives for millennia, and that they are an odd but perfectly natural part of the ecosystem.",
					"The danger that giant fire slugs pose is much more certain than their origins. Though they share the general passive nature of regular fire slugs, they are easier to provoke. Even when they are not being aggressive, giant fire slugs are a hazard for coastal towns and fishing villages. Between the intense heat they produce and the toxic trail of mucus they leave, these creatures can do considerable damage to wooden structures, crops, livestock, and people. If it decides to search a settlement for food, a single unchecked fire slug can render significant sections uninhabitable for days or weeks, until the fires die down and the soil recovers from the toxic mucus."

					"The zonathid will use its acid eyebeam to melt through clothing and armor, and its necrotic eyebeam to rapidly decay skin, scales, and other natural barriers between it and the humanoid's flesh, using its poison eyebeam as necessary to numb the wound before the victim can notice. Once it has opened a shallow wound (typically 2-3 centimeters wide), it positions its \\\"mouth\\\" above the wound, and presses down. It secretes an adhesive numbing agent that both glues its body to the skin of the victim, and numbs the area. While the numbing from its poison eyebeam is relatively short-lived, the anesthetic qualities of this mucus are much stronger. If the victim humanoid does not notice the mucus (see the saving throw for its Adhere action), the wound and surrounding area will remain numb for {@dice 1d4+3} days.",
					"If it successfully adheres to its victim, the abyssal zonathid proceeds to its feeding stage. First, it inserts its oral tentacles into blood vessels exposed by the wound. These tentacles siphon blood from the host, providing both sustenance and information. Once it has begun absorbing blood from its victim, the zonathid will change appearance, taking on the color and texture of the victim's skin. It becomes very difficult to notice, appearing only as a slightly raised bump on the skin (this bump can be between 2-4 inches wide). At this point, especially if it has chosen an area on its host's back, the zonathid may remain undetected for weeks.",
					"Once it has fully connected to the host's bloodstream and camouflaged itself, the abyssal zonathid begins its secondary feeding behavior. Though it is unkown exactly why, the creature will use its large central tongue to lap at the open wound, keeping it just irritated enough to prevent healing. While the numbing effects of the mucus last, this licking is undetectable. Even after the mucus has worn off, the host will be unable to pinpoint the sensation, feeling only a general discomfort and uneasiness. Explicitly focusing on this sensation and succeeding a DC 15 Perception check will allow a victim to localize this feeling to a specific part of the body, though it will not specifically reveal the zonathid.",
					"If the zonathid remains attached to a host for more than 2 weeks, the host's maximum hit points are reduced by {@dice 1d4}, and this effect increases by {@dice 1d4} for every 2 successive weeks. Additionally, each month the abyssal zonathid remains attached, the victim gains a level of exhaustion, which does not fade until the zonathid is removed.",
					"Removing an abyssal zonathid from its host is non-trivial. Attempting to pull or scrape it off, or remove it by some other means, is ill advised; when disrupted or injured, the zonathid releases chemicals that powerfully stimulate the host's nervous system, causing intense pain and convulsions. If it is killed while attached to a host (if the host has not already died from shock and muscle spasms), it releases potent toxins into the host's bloodstream, dealing {@dice 3d4} poison damage and poisoning the victim. A creature that has been poisoned in this way remains poisoned until healed by the effects of {@spell Lesser Restoration} or another spell or effect that cures diseases and conditions. The dead zonathid must also be removed from the wound and its oral tentacles extracted, which usually involves cutting off some of the host's skin, unless a method of dissolving the adhesive mucus can be found.",
					"An abyssal zonathid may be successfully removed without poisoning its host if it is dealt twice its maximum HP in radiant damage in one round, or if the spell {@spell Lesser Restoration} or a similar spell is cast on it."

					"\"There was a sudden unidentifiable sound, loud, and followed by a rain of small, sharp spines. Our local guide informed us that the explosion was the result of a dehydrated acanthar urchin, likely one that had been launched out of its spring by a geyser. The sound is difficult to describe; somewhere between the pop of a balloon and the crunch of dry leaves.\"",

					"The acanthar urchin is a creature full of irregular, contradictory properties. Their venom is usually no more dangerous than a bee sting, but about 5% of victims suffer sudden cardiac arrest. Though quite sturdy for their size, if left out of water for too long, they destabilize in spectacular fashion, suddenly exploding and releasing a shower of venomous spines. Finally, as a seeming rebellion against their toxic nature, the innards of acanthar urchins can be used to produce a soothing salve, useful for treating skin irritation and contact poisons.",
					"Their odd idiosyncrasies don't stop with their physical features; while they can be found in shallow ocean waters like many other urchins, acanthar urchins are more common in sulfurous springs. It is still unknown how these creatures survive in such extreme conditions, or how they even reach such springs in the first place. Some theories suggest that the urchins release spores when they explode, hoping that at least a few reach a new body of water. Conversely, it is the belief of certain druidic circles that most acanthar urchins live in massive populations deep under the earth, and that the specimens found in sulfur springs are those few individuals that have floated to the surface. These druids also hold that acanthar urchins play a vital role in natural energy cycles.",
					"For adventurers, however, the usefulness of the acanthar urchin in setting traps is much more interesting than its ecology. The urchins may be used as fire-activated grenades or mines. The cumulative effects of their venom mean that even a small pile of urchins can be turned into a dangerous explosive trap with little more than a torch or some lamp oil.",
					"---",
					"Poisons and Salves",
					"The acanthar urchin can be harvested to produce both a poison and a salve.",
					"- Poison. To produce a useful poison from acanthar venom, the spines must be harvested. A single vial requires the spines of {@dice 1d4+1} urchins; these spines must be boiled in water from a sulfur spring for at least 1 hour.",
					"The poison only works if dispersed in a creature's bloodstream; this can be accomplished by coating a piercing or slashing weapon, or injecting the poison with a syringe. The poison lasts for 4 attacks when coating a weapon.",
					"A creature affected by the poison must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes {@dice 2d4} poison damage and is poisoned until the end of its next turn (if inflicted by a weapon) or for 1 hour (if injected with a syringe). Furthermore, if the result of the saving throw is less than 8 (or a natural 1), the creature suffers a heart attack, taking 4 levels of exhaustion and falling unconscious.",
					"- Salve. The innards of acanthar urchins can be used to make a soothing salve. To access the innards, the urchins must be cracked open, taking care not to contaminate the organs with the venom in the spines. A single dose requires the innards from {@dice 1d4} urchins. The gooey mass of tissues must then be thoroughly mixed with half a liter of lotion, gel, or other skin-safe viscous fluid.",
					"    One dose of salve is enough to treat one limb or half the torso of a medium creature, or two limbs or the entire torso of a small creature. When applied to the skin of a creature, the salve fully soothes skin irritation and inflammation, such as that caused by poison ivy or bug bites. Additionally, if applied to skin affected by a contact poison within 10 minutes of exposure, the salve will cure a creature of the effects of the poison, including removing the poisoned condition (it does not heal any damage or undo effects that have already applied).",
					"    Certain exotic or magical poisons may be too strong to be healed by this salve; don't treat it as an excuse to pour strange liquids on your skin (or your friends' skins)."

They emit a soft glow, and are serene creatures, almost mesmerizing to watch as they float through the air with their characteristic erratic pulsing. These tiny fey appear as an odd mix between mushrooms and jellyfish. At rest, they settle on forest and cave floors, as well as tree trunks and cave walls and ceilings, and in this state can easily be mistaken for glowing mushrooms. This misidentification is easily realized when they are disturbed, detaching from surfaces and drifting about, the stalks of these \\\"mushrooms\\\" unfolding to reveal a set of tiny tentacles.",

Their eyes are not very sophisticated, and they can only see within a small radius. They are, however, very sensitive to light, and seem to be able to detect light sources well outside their normal range of vision.",

					"Swarmkeeper rangers from areas affected by fae magic, or with some connection to the Feywild, often choose deepstars as their swarm creature. Additionally, if provided with a steady supply of plant matter, they can be convinced to reside in almost any building or area; some people put them in special lanterns, both to provide light and as good luck charms. However, deepstars avoid light during the day, so these lanterns must be covered before the sun rises to avoid distressing them.",
					"While they are generally peaceful and friendly, there are two things that a deepstar cannot tolerate. The first is damage to the natural world; deepstars will quickly abandon an area that unsustainably exploits natural resources. If forced to stay in these areas, they become agitated, and will become aggressive if not set free quickly.",
					"The other deep-seated aversion that deepstars have is toward fire. These fey are especially vulnerable to burning, and they avoid fire at all costs. If a deepstar is burned by fire, it becomes panicked, and if the burn was inflicted by a creature, it enters a rage, calling other deepstars to its aid and becoming a much more aggressive and dangerous deepstar swarm.

Generally, sighting a deepstar is considered a sign of good luck.",

In addition to the damage to their psyches, corrupted deepstars suffer physical changes when they are deprived of nature. They lose the ability to produce poison, as well as their characteristic susceptibility to flames. While they are still flammable, it is ill advised to attempt to use fire against a corrupted deepstar swarm, since they will burst into flames and become even more dangerous.",

Tiny flytrap anemones are common on coral reefs and shipwrecks, but they are more of a nuisance than a threat, being too small to consider humanoids worthwhile prey. Small flytrap anemones, on the other hand, might attempt to engulf a limb or wrap around it, and a Medium or Large flytrap anemone might even try to enclose an unlucky person whole!",

While deepstars average between 6-8 inches tall, with outliers reaching over 10 inches, giant deepstars regularly grow over a foot, with the tallest measured at just under 2 feet.",
					"As a result of their increased size, giant deepstars are slightly stronger and slower than normal deepstars, and have lost some of their connection to the Feywild in exchange for a greater anchor to the prime material plane. This has resulted in the loss of their ability to produce spores, but it has also made them much less flammable. Giant deepstars still retain a slight aversion to fire, but they no longer have reason to fear it more than any other creature. As part of their adaptation as familiars, giant deepstars have also been cured of their small range of sight.",
					"Those bonded to a giant deepstar familiar have reported that seeing through the eyes of a deepstar is not as easy as sharing the senses of other familiars. Deepstars have eyes placed at regular intervals in a circle around their bells, and adapting one's mind to properly comprehend a 360-degree field of vision takes effort and practice. Headaches, temporary blindness, and general confusion are common side effects until the deepstar's master becomes mentally experienced with this dramatic shift in perspective."

					"Sounds of a rampaging dragon have been heard in the countryside for days. The locals sent word to the city, which has dispatched a team of adventurers to investigate. As the adventurers close in on the lair, they begin to notice a nauseating, putrid stench in the air. There is the sound of a dragon roar, oddly wet and gurgling. Suddenly, the ground shakes, and something bursts from the cave entrance. It is a dragon, but something is dreadfully wrong. All color has drained from its scales, its eyes are sunken in its skull, and there are large, seeping holes in its flesh. The rogue stealthily approaches from behind, but right when she moves to strike, she is caught off guard by a pink flash of movement. Out of one of its oozing wounds, a fleshy worm with rings of razor-sharp teeth lashes out, ripping through the rogue's armor and tearing her forearm to shreds. It is only then that the party notices the wriggling underneath the dragon's skin. This dragon has fallen victim to an ancalag infestation.",

Specialized to infest dragons, the fleshy form of an ancalag belies its incredible strength and resilience. Moreover, ancalags rarely attack alone. They hide in caves, sewers, and other out-of-the-way places, infecting any creatures they can, then compelling their hosts to seek out their true target: dragons.",
					"The effects of ancalag infestation depend on the host. More than one may infest a host, in which case effects are cumulative, and surgically removing multiple ancalags requires a separate Dexterity check for each one. Aside from {@spell Wish}, all magical methods of curing ancalag infestation deal half the necrotic damage associated with a failed surgical Dexterity check, per ancalag (27 ({@damage 5d10}) for dragons or 11 ({@damage 2d10}) for others).",
					"- If the host is not a true dragon, it becomes compelled to seek out true dragons, though this confers no special ability to find dragons. The creature behaves as it normally would, except that its primary goal is to find a true dragon. Ancalag infestation also reduces the maximum hit points of the host by 5 ({@dice 2d4}).",
					"The infestation can be cured by {@spell Greater Restoration} or more powerful healing magic. The ancalag may also be removed surgically by a professional surgeon, requiring a DC 25 Wisdom (Medicine) check to extract the ancalag, and a DC 25 Dexterity check to avoid releasing the ancalag's bodily fluids into the host, which deals 22 ({@damage 4d10}) necrotic damage. This surgery takes {@dice 1d4+1} hours, and regardless of the result, leaves the subject incapacitated for {@dice 1d4+3} days. The creature must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom to take any action that would lead toward curing the infestation.",
					"- If the host is a wyrmling or young dragon, it begins the transformation into an infested wyrmling or young dragon, whose information can be found in this document. This transformation takes 1 year, after which the infestation is incurable. ",
					"Ancalags feed on the innate magic of these dragons, which makes them almost impossible to successfully remove from a dragon host. Only {@spell Mass Heal}, {@spell Power Word Heal}, or {@spell Wish} can cure such an infection, or {@spell Regenerate} cast every hour for 24 hours. Alternatively, surgically removing an ancalag from a dragon requires an experienced professional surgeon, adamantine surgical tools, and a DC 30 Wisdom (Medicine) check. The surgeon must also succeed on a DC 30 Dexterity check to avoid releasing the ancalag's bodily fluids into the dragon, which deals 55 ({@damage 10d10}) necrotic damage. Such a surgery takes {@dice 1d6+2} hours, and leaves the dragon incapacitated for {@dice 1d4+1} weeks.",
					"- If the host is an adult or ancient dragon, the infestation fails, as the immense magical power of these dragons overwhelms the ancalag. Other immensely powerful creatures (CR >12) are generally immune to ancalag infestation. Ancalags are also incapable of infesting aberrations, constructs, elementals, oozes, or plants."

Using the two enormous flaps on either side of its feeding hole, a pelican flower can fly, appearing somewhat like a giant, clumsy butterfly. It uses this ability to swoop down on unsuspecting prey, relying on potent digestive acids to dissolve food before it has a chance to fight back.",
					"Fortunately, though they are much larger than most blooms, pelican flowers are too small to target anything bigger than a housecat. Their normal prey are small rodents and reptiles, which they attract with a sweet, honey-like fragrance. When not actively feeding, pelican flowers attach themselves to trees, vines, and other plants, attempting to blend in with the flora until suitable prey wanders too close.",
					"Pelican flowers are uncommon, tending to grow in places not frequented by people. Gardeners occasionally seek them out for use as natural pest control, but this is a tricky endeavor. Since the flowers are not intelligent enough to be trained, they often end up eating a pet or two before the gardener in question realizes the problem and gets rid of them. Druids and tribal shamans sometimes maintain a population of pelican flowers for medicinal use; their digestive acids, when diluted, are very effective at reducing itching, irritation, and pain associated with bug bites and stings, poisonous plants, and other minor inconveniences. In more concentrated solutions, the acids can be used to dissolve organic matter. One flower provides one vial of digestive acid, which functions in combat like a regular vial of acid, except that it deals 2 ({@dice 1d4}) acid damage on hit and at the start of the target's turns, until a creature uses an action to wipe off the acid. Out of combat, one vial takes 1 minute to dissolve an area of animal or plant matter no larger than 6 inches on a side. 15 vials will dissolve 1 cubic foot of flesh or plant matter in about 10 minutes, while dissolving the same amount of bone takes roughly an hour. ",
					"To dissolve an entire creature, the {@bold approximate} amount of acid needed is as follows:",

					"- Small creature: 8 vials to dissolve flesh in 5 minutes. Additional 3 vials to dissolve skeleton in 15 minutes.",

					"It is nearly impossible to find enough flowers by foraging to dissolve anything larger than a single Medium creature, since there are never very many pelican flowers in a single area. Acid on these quantities must be purchased from someone who cultivates pelican flowers and harvests the digestive acid."

					"Sounds of a rampaging dragon have been heard in the countryside for days. The locals sent word to the city, which has dispatched a team of adventurers to investigate. As the adventurers close in on the lair, they begin to notice a nauseating, putrid stench in the air. There is the sound of a dragon roar, oddly wet and gurgling. Suddenly, the ground shakes, and something bursts from the cave entrance. It is a dragon, but something is dreadfully wrong. All color has drained from its scales, its eyes are sunken in its skull, and there are large, seeping holes in its flesh. The rogue stealthily approaches from behind, but right when she moves to strike, she is caught off guard by a pink flash of movement. Out of one of its oozing wounds, a fleshy worm with rings of razor-sharp teeth lashes out, ripping through the rogue's armor and tearing her forearm to shreds. It is only then that the party notices the wriggling underneath the dragon's skin. This dragon has fallen victim to an ancalag infestation.",
					"Only wyrmlings and young dragons can naturally be infested by ancalags. The potent magic of an adult or ancient dragon is too powerful for the parasites to survive under normal circumstances. Occasionally, however, a cult worshipping a deity of disease or some other corrupting influence will perform a ritual to weaken an adult dragon, allowing it to be infested by ancalags, and forming a disgusting force of reckoning. These rituals, powerful as they may be, are still incapable of weakening an ancient dragon; an infested ancient dragon is only ever created through the direct action of a deity, archdevil, or similarly powerful force. These creatures are practically avatars of disease and corruption.",
					"Infested dragons of any age speak rarely and with difficulty. When they do speak, it is with a wet, rasping gurgle. Since it is not really the dragon speaking, but the colony of ancalags inside speaking through the dragon's mouth, infested dragons refer to themselves in the third person, and may talk with multiple voices, interrupting each other or echoing speech, as if many creatures were speaking at once.",
					"An infested adult or ancient dragon will inhabit the same lair that it did before it was infested, but it makes noticeable changes to the surrounding area. The existing regional effects fade as if the dragon were dead, and the infested dragon makes every effort to make it appear as though the lair is abandoned. Aside from the abundant worms burrowing throughout the area, there are few cues that a dragon still resides in the lair. In this way, the infested dragon hopes to lure a young dragon with the temptation of a pre-established lair and territory. When a young dragon falls for the trap, it finds not a welcoming, abandoned lair, but only an ambush of ancalags, waiting to infest another host.",
					"When found in the wild, ancalags are tiny, pathetic-looking pink worms. Their rings of teeth look mildly threatening, but few people realize how dangerous these parasites really are. Specialized to infest dragons, the fleshy form of an ancalag belies its incredible strength and resilience. Moreover, ancalags rarely attack alone. They hide in caves, sewers, and other out-of-the-way places, infecting any creatures they can, then compelling their hosts to seek out their true target: dragons."

					"Sounds of a rampaging dragon have been heard in the countryside for days. The locals sent word to the city, which has dispatched a team of adventurers to investigate. As the adventurers close in on the lair, they begin to notice a nauseating, putrid stench in the air. There is the sound of a dragon roar, oddly wet and gurgling. Suddenly, the ground shakes, and something bursts from the cave entrance. It is a dragon, but something is dreadfully wrong. All color has drained from its scales, its eyes are sunken in its skull, and there are large, seeping holes in its flesh. The rogue stealthily approaches from behind, but right when she moves to strike, she is caught off guard by a pink flash of movement. Out of one of its oozing wounds, a fleshy worm with rings of razor-sharp teeth lashes out, ripping through the rogue's armor and tearing her forearm to shreds. It is only then that the party notices the wriggling underneath the dragon's skin. This dragon has fallen victim to an ancalag infestation.",
					"Only wyrmlings and young dragons can naturally be infested by ancalags. The potent magic of an adult or ancient dragon is too powerful for the parasites to survive under normal circumstances. Occasionally, however, a cult worshipping a deity of disease or some other corrupting influence will perform a ritual to weaken an adult dragon, allowing it to be infested by ancalags, and forming a disgusting force of reckoning. These rituals, powerful as they may be, are still incapable of weakening an ancient dragon; an infested ancient dragon is only ever created through the direct action of a deity, archdevil, or similarly powerful force. These creatures are practically avatars of disease and corruption.",
					"Infested dragons of any age speak rarely and with difficulty. When they do speak, it is with a wet, rasping gurgle. Since it is not really the dragon speaking, but the colony of ancalags inside speaking through the dragon's mouth, infested dragons refer to themselves in the third person, and may talk with multiple voices, interrupting each other or echoing speech, as if many creatures were speaking at once.",
					"An infested adult or ancient dragon will inhabit the same lair that it did before it was infested, but it makes noticeable changes to the surrounding area. The existing regional effects fade as if the dragon were dead, and the infested dragon makes every effort to make it appear as though the lair is abandoned. Aside from the abundant worms burrowing throughout the area, there are few cues that a dragon still resides in the lair. In this way, the infested dragon hopes to lure a young dragon with the temptation of a pre-established lair and territory. When a young dragon falls for the trap, it finds not a welcoming, abandoned lair, but only an ambush of ancalags, waiting to infest another host.",
					"When found in the wild, ancalags are tiny, pathetic-looking pink worms. Their rings of teeth look mildly threatening, but few people realize how dangerous these parasites really are. Specialized to infest dragons, the fleshy form of an ancalag belies its incredible strength and resilience. Moreover, ancalags rarely attack alone. They hide in caves, sewers, and other out-of-the-way places, infecting any creatures they can, then compelling their hosts to seek out their true target: dragons."

					"Upon first spotting a bush viper, one would be forgiven for mistaking it for a vine or small branch. With further investigation, its eyes and mouth can be identified, showing that it is actually a tiny snake with excellent camouflage. It is not until one handles a bush viper that its true nature can be uncovered; the \"snake\" is made up of tiny twigs, vines, and leaves, woven together in a convincing facsimile of a serpent.",
					"While it behaves almost identically to bestial snakes, the bush viper is some form of awakened plant, its body composed similarly to an {@creature awakened shrub}. Like true snakes, bush vipers are hesitant to bite anything that isn't prey unless they feel unavoidably threatened. Bush vipers tend to be docile when handled, provided the handler does not squeeze or poke them, or make sudden, startling moves. This docility is not to be mistaken for tameness, however; only bush vipers raised from birth can be properly trained as familiars.",
					"The process of bush viper reproduction is both beautiful and intricate. As plants, bush vipers seem capable of surviving on 3-5 hours of sunlight per day, along with an adequate supply of water, but they are incapable of reproducing without a couple meals of living prey. In springtime, if a bush viper is adequately fed with small reptiles and rodents, or particularly large insects, it will begin to produce small flowers along its body. Males produce a plethora of flowers, turning them almost entirely pink, while females will only grow a few slightly larger flowers. When properly pollinated, the female's flowers swell into bulbs. Fully grown, the bulbs are about the size and shape of a regular snake egg, but they retain the bright pink coloration of the mother's flowers. Once they are \"ripe,\" the bulbs fall off the mother, at which point she collects them into a small pile and spends about one week coiled around them, protecting them while ensuring they receive adequate sunlight. During this time, the bright pink bulbs slowly change to a verdant green color. When all traces of pink are gone, a baby bush viper emerges from the bulb. This is a crucial time for those wishing to tame a bush viper. In order to form the proper bond, a trainer must ensure that they are the first creature the baby sees when it hatches. They must then care for the viper as it grows, developing both its trust and its understanding of commands.",
					"Given their nature, bush vipers are valued as familiars for druids, hedge wizards, and other practitioners of magic who operate far from civilization. Bush vipers do not function well in industrial or urban settings, or anywhere they do not have easy access to trees, fresh water, and sunlight. A bush viper deprived of these things for even a day begins to brown and wilt, slowly losing mobility until it becomes as stiff and brittle as dead twigs and leaves.",
					"Bush viper flowers are highly valued in druidic rituals, especially those intended to increase one's connection to and harmony with nature. Only male's flowers are used; picking a female's flowers is extremely taboo in most druidic circles. However, witches and other practitioners of more occult magic claim that the flowers from a female bush viper grant the power to control and warp plants, accelerating their growth and causing them to develop thorns, poison sap, and other sinister adaptations.
