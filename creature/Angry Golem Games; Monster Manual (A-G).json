					"DESCRIPTION",
					"The aarakocra are a race of intelligent bird-men that live on the peaks of the highest mountains, spending their days soaring on the thermal winds in peace and solitude. Aarakocra are about 5 feet tall and have a wing span of 20 feet.",
					"About halfway along the edge of each wing is a hand with three human-sized fingers and an opposable thumb. An elongated fourth finger extends the length of the wing and locks in place for flying.",
					"Though the wing-hands cannot grasp during flight, they are nearly as useful as human hands when an aarakocra is on the ground and its wings are folded back. The wing muscles anchor in a bony chest plate that provides the aarakocra with extra protection.",
					"The powerful legs end in four sharp talons that can unlock and fold back to reveal another pair of functional hands, also with three human-sized fingers and an opposable thumb. The hand bones, like the rest of an aarakocra's skeleton, are hollow and fragile.",
					"Aarakocra faces resemble crosses between parrots and eagles. They have gray-black beaks, and black eyes set frontally in their heads that provide keen binocular vision. Plumage color varies from tribe to tribe, but generally males are red, orange, and yellow while females are brown and gray.",
					"Aarakocra speak their own language, the language of giant eagles, and, on occasion, the common tongue (10% chance).",
					"HABITAT / SOCIETY",
					"Aarakocra live in small tribes of about 1d20+10 members. Each tribe has a hunting territory of about 10,000 square miles with colorful banners and pennants marking the boundaries.",
					"Each tribe lives in a communal nest made of woven vines with a soft lining of dried grass. The eldest male serves as the tribe's leader. In tribes of more than 20 members, the second oldest male serves as the shaman, leading simple religious ceremonies involving the whistling of melodic hymns at sunset on the first day of a new month.",
					"Males spend most of their waking hours hunting for food and occasionally for treasure, such as gems and other shiny objects. Females spend eight months of the year incubating their eggs, passing the time by fabricating javelins and other tools from wood and stone.",
					"While resting on their backs, aarakocra females can use all four hands at the same time to weave boundary pennants, javelins sheaths, and other useful objects from vines and feathers.",
					"Five aarakocra, including a shaman, can summon an air elemental by chanting and performing an intricate aerial dance for three melee rounds. The summoned air elemental will comply with the aarakocras' request for a favor, though it will not endanger its life on their behalf.",
					"Aarakocra are extremely claustrophobic and will not willingly enter a cave, building, or other enclosed area.",
					"ECOLOGY",
					"Aarakocra have little to do with other species, including neighboring aarakocra tribes, and leave their home territory only in extreme circumstances. They rarely encounter humans except for an occasional foray into a rural community to snatch a stray farm animal; this is not an intentionally malicious act, as aarakocra are unable to distinguish between domestic and wild animals.",
					"A human venturing into aarakocra territory may be able to convince one to serve as a guide or a scout in exchange for a shiny jewel or coin."

					"DESCRIPTION",
					"The aboleth is a loathsome amphibious creature that lives in subterranean caves and lakes. It despises most land-dwelling creatures and seeks to enslave intelligent surface beings. It is as cruel as it is intelligent.",
					"An aboleth resembles a plump fish, 20 feet in length from its bulbous head to its fluke-like tail. Its body is blue-green with gray splotches, and its pink-tan underbelly conceals a toothless, rubbery mouth. Three slit-like eyes, purple-red in color and protected by bony ridges, are set one atop the other in the front of its head. Four pulsating blue-black orifices line the bottom of its body and secrete gray slime that smells like rancid grease. Four leathery tentacles, each 10 feet in length, grow from its head. An aboleth uses its tail to propel itself through the water and its tentacles to drag itself along dry land.",
					"HABITAT / SOCIETY",
					"An aboleth brood consists of a parent and one to three offspring. Though the offspring are as large and as strong as the parent, they defer to the parent in all matters and obey it implicitly. Aboleth have both male and female sexual organs. A mature aboleth reproduces once every five years by concealing itself in a cavern or other remote area, then laying a single egg and covering it in slime. The parent aboleth guards the egg while the embryo grows and develops, a process that takes about five years. A newborn aboleth takes about 10 years to mature.",
					"The aboleth spends most of its time searching for slaves, preferably human ones. It is rumored that the aboleth use their slaves to construct huge underwater cities, though none have ever been found. The aboleth are rumored to know ancient, horrible secrets that predate the existence of man, but these rumors are also unsubstantiated. There is no doubt that aboleth retain a staggering amount of knowledge. An offspring acquires all of its parent's knowledge at birth, and a mature aboleth acquires the knowledge of any intelligent being it consumes.",
					"An aboleth's treasure consists of items taken from its slaves. The items are buried in caverns under a layer of slime resembling gray mud, recognizable by the distinctive rancid grease odor.",
					"ECOLOGY",
					"The omnivorous aboleth will eat any organic matter, usually algae and micro-organism, but they are also fond of intelligent prey so they can absorb nutrients and information at the same time. Aboleth have no natural enemies, as even the mightiest marine creatures give them a wide berth. Aboleth slime is sometime used as a component for potions of water breathing."

					"Petty and wicked, dretches are the most common tanar'ri, found in massive hordes everywhere in the Abyss. Along with the manes, the dretches are the rank-and-file of the Blood War.",
					"Dretches are gaunt, squat humanoids with rubbery, almost hairless bodies. Their skin is pale white to beige, giving way to sickly blue in some areas, stretched over pulsing varicose veins. Dretches' mouths are slack and slobbery with many small fangs. Their hair is sparse and bristly, exposing pointed ears that hang limply from either side of the head. A dretch's eyes slant downward and the nose appears squashed.",
					"HABITAT / SOCIETY",
					"Dretcbes are the lowest form of actual tanar'ri; their inferiors, the manes, are merely dead spirits from the Prime Material Plane. Dretches mill around and torment the manes to avoid considering their own lowly position.",
					"Some dretches try to be extremely useful, hoping for promotion. Others consider themselves so lowly that they have nothing to lose, and they rebel. By virtue of their numbers, they feel they can go their own way and ignore the more powerful tanar'ri. This leads to a huge slaughter of the rebellious dretches by more powerful tanar'ri. These civil outbreaks temporarily divert the tanar'ri from the Blood War, sometimes with disastrous results.",
					"ECOLOGY",
					"Dretches are important to the Blood War. The primary strength of the tanar'ri is their sheer numbers, and those numbers consist largely of dretches. Unlike the hordlings, they are actual tanar'ri and have concern for their position. This makes them more reliable than hordlings, if the term applies to any creature in the Abyss.",
					"The dretches' weakness makes them a perfect choice for food in an environment where food is scarce. Greater fiends eat them in great quantities."

					"DESCRIPTION",
					"The horrors of the Abyss are uncountable. Layers upon layers of seething, pustulent evil wait for the unwary traveler. At first glance, it'd seem that some of the Abyssal layers are uninhabitable, even for tanar'ri but a body'd be addle-coved to believe that. The alkiliths're a type of tanar'ri that thrives in the foulest and most inhospitable places of the Ahyss, acting as personal agents of the unspeakable Abyssal Lords.",
					"Alkiliths've got an unusual purpose among the true tanar'ri: They exist to corrupt all they touch, extending the reach of the Ahyss by despoiling anything that comes into contact with it. The alkiliths seek to pollute the world beyond the Abyss physically and morally. While fiends such as the glabrezu and succubi bring mortals to the Abyss, the alkiliths work to bring the Abyss itself to any world unfortunate enough to be within reach. Alkiliths destroy things that are beautiful, desecrate things that are sacred, and fan the embers of fear or resentment into raging hatred. By spreading chaos and evil throughout the multiverse, they'll increase the power of the Abyss.",
					"Alkiliths're closely tied to the various slimes, jellies, and oozes found on many prime worlds. They're not remotely humanoid, taking the form of a disgusting blob of phosphorescent green corruption. Their bodies are surrounded by a cracked, leathery coating or secretion that constantly oozes more of their vile protoplasm in a continual process of exuding and reabsorbing hide. Alkiliths're capable of assuming a semi-rigid form, and their pseudopods can wield weapons and manipulate objects with surprising precision. Dark, swollen eye-globules dot an alkilith's surface; normally the creature's got anywhere from 3 to 7 of these spread out around its body to observe what's happening around it.",
					"HABITAT / SOCIETY",
					"Alkiliths're the envoys, agents, and assassins of the Abyssal Lords. A great number of their missions take place within the Abyss, as the lords of the tanar'ri spend much of their time scheming and feuding with each other. From time to time they're sent into the Great Wheel or onto the Prime Material Plane on an errand of vile corruption. Alkiliths take an unholy delight in tasks that allow them to mar things or places of beauty.",
					"The Blood War's only a tangential concern for the alkiliths. They'll fight when they have to, but normally they steer clear of the babaus and molydei by retreating into regions so despicable and unclean that even other tanar'ri hesitate to follow. However, an alkilith'll savagely attack any baatezu it encounters while it's about its work.",
					"Alkiliths aren't very common in the Abyss, but they're greatly feared because other tanar'ri have no innate resistance to their horrible acid or vile cloud of poisonous gas. As creatures of the Abyssal Lords, the alkiliths aren't well-liked by their peers, but they're guaranteed a certain measure of protection.

The only visible difference between illithid and illithilich is that an alhoon's skin is dry and often wrinkled, never glistening with slime.",
					"HABITAT / SOCIETY",
					"Alhoon spurn illithid societies ruled by elder brains, and do not hesitate to take living mind flayers as thought controlled slaves (just as they took all other creatures as slaves, when alive a process continued in lich state).",
					"They usually live alone in the surface world, often slaying a human wizard and taking over his remote tower, but in the Underdark cooperate for mutual survival, sharing spells and aid freely to overcome drow, duergar, cloakers, aboleth, and living mind flayers alike.",
					"Alhoon are capable of diplomacy and of loyally adhering to alliances when they see an ultimate benefit but they consider all other beings cattle, and promises to them merely empty conveniences. Alhoon regard true liches and beholders as their greatest rivals, and accordingly destroy them whenever prudently possible.",
					"ECOLOGY",
					"Alhoon have no need for sustenance, but their bodies adapt only imperfectly to lich state; many magical steps of most lichdom processes used by others fail on a strongly-magic resistant mind flayer body. Alhoon are plagued by ongoing skin wrinkling and tissue desiccation, which they counteract by bathing, or by drinking water, soup, alcohol, and other liquids. Nutrients need not be ingested, and poisons absorbed in this way will harm an alhoon (lowering its hit points no further than a minimum of 6 hp and not \"killing\" it). The illithilich state neutralizes most poisons (restoring all damage done by them) in 2d4 turns.",
					"Illithiliches enjoy devouring brains just as they did in life, but do not need to do so. Sometimes devouring a brain gives an alhoon mental \"glimpses\" of thoughts that the brain held, either at random, or (if the alhoon concentrates on a topic, such as magical items, written spells, or treasure locations), thoughts most closely related to a chosen topic.",
					"Essence of alhoon brain is a general ingredient in spell-writing inks, and can be employed with great advantage in the crafting of any magical item concerned with effects of the minds of creatures."

They are by far the strongest of the sphinxes, but unlike their counterparts, have no true pattern of behavior universal to all androsphinxes. They despise communicating with humans and hate riddles (mostly because gynosphinxes love them so much). It is therefore suggested by those knowledgeable in mythological beasts and desert lore that androsphinxes are the guardians of the sphinxes, evil (hieraco-), neutral (gyno- and crio-), and good (andro-).",
					"Certainly, androsphinxes are the lifelong adversaries of the hieracosphinxes, but they almost always let the defeated enemy go free instead of finishing the kill (often with a roar or two at the fleeing sphinxes' behinds).",

They have been known to bargain with men on occasion, but are the least greedy of the sphinxes, and are the only sphinxes likely to take offense at such offerings if made by characters with low Charismas or evil alignments."

					"{@link ANKHEG's TACTICS (read the article)|https://angrygolem-games.com/fight-like-an-ankheg/}",
					"DESCRIPTION",
					"The ankheg is a burrowing monster usually found in forests or choice agricultural land. Because of its fondness for fresh meat, the ankheg is a threat to any creature unfortunate enough to encounter it. The ankheg resembles an enormous many-legged worm. Its six legs end in sharp hooks suitable for burrowing and grasping, and its powerful mandibles are capable of snapping a small tree in half with a single bite.",
					"A tough chitinous shell, usually brown or yellow, covers its entire body except for its soft pink belly. The ankheg has glistening black eyes, a small mouth lined with tiny rows of chitinous teeth, and two sensitive antennae that can detect movement of man-sized creatures up to 300 feet away.",
					"HABITAT / SOCIETY",
					"The ankheg uses its mandibles to continuously dig winding tunnels 30-40 feet deep in the rich soil of forests or farmlands. The hollowed end of a tunnel serves as a temporary lair for sleeping, eating, or hibernating.",
					"When an ankheg exhausts the food supply in a particular forest or field, it moves on to another. Autumn is mating season for ankhegs. After the male fertilizes the female, the female kills him and deposits 2d6 fertilized eggs in his body. Within a few weeks, about 75% of the eggs hatch and begin feeding. In a year, the young ankhegs resemble adults and can function independently.",
					"Young ankhegs have 2 Hit Dice and an AC 10 overall and an AC 12 for their undersides; they bite for 2d4 points of damage (with an additional ld4 points of damage from enzyme secretions), and spit for 1d6 points of damage to a distance of 30 feet.",
					"In every year thereafter, the ankheg functions with full adult capabilities and gains an additional Hit Die until it reaches 6 Hit Dice. Beginning in its second year of life, the ankheg sheds its chitinous shell just before the onset of winter. It takes the ankheg two days to shed its old shell and two weeks to grow a new one.",
					"During this time, the sluggish ankheg is exceptionally vulnerable. Its overall AC is reduced by 10 and its underside AC is reduced by 5. Additionally, it moves at only half its normal speed, its mandible attack inflicts only 1d6 points of damage, and it is unable to squirt acidic enzymes.",
					"While growing a new shell, it protects itself by hiding in a deep tunnel and secreting a repulsive fluid that smells like rotten fruit. Though the aroma discourages most creatures, it can also pinpoint the ankheg's location for human hunters and desperately hungry predators.",
					"Ankhegs living in cold climates hibernate during the winter. Within a month after the first snowfall, the ankheg fashions a lair deep within the warm earth where it remains dormant until spring. The hibernating ankheg requires no food, subsisting instead on nutrients stored in its shell.",
					"The ankheg does not secrete aromatic fluid during this time and is thus relatively safe from detection, Though the ankheg's metabolism is reduced, its antennae remain functional, able to alert it to the approach of an intruder.",
					"A disturbed ankheg fully awakens in 1d4 rounds, after which time it can attack and move normally. The ankheg does not hoard treasure. Items that were not dissolved by the acidic enzymes fall where they drop from the ankheg's mandibles and can be found scattered throughout its tunnel system.",
					"ECOLOGY",
					"Though a hungry ankheg can be fatal to a farmer, it can be quite beneficial to the farmland. Its tunnel system laces the soil with passages for air and water, while the ankheg's waste products add rich nutrients.",
					"The ankheg will eat decayed organic matter in the earth, but it prefers fresh meat. All but the fiercest predators avoid ankhegs. Dried and cured ankheg shells can be made into armor with an AC of 16, and its digestive enzymes can be used as regular acid.",
					"Ankheg is employed as material component to empower the following spells: {@spell Mage Armor}"

The eyes of an annis are dull green or yellow. Annis have normal infravision (60-foot range), but superior hearing and sense of smell.",
					"An annis attacks using its talons and teeth to inflict horrible wounds. In melee, annis tend to close and grapple. An annis that hits an opponent with all three of its attacks in one round has successfully grappled its opponent. Next round, all attacks by the annis are automatic hits, unless the opponent is stronger, the annis is slain, or the victim uses some magical means to escape the hag. Otherwise, the annis will continue to hold the victim in its grasp, and deliver damage with its raking talons and sharpened teeth each round until the victim is slain.",
					"In addition to normal attacks, annis have the ability to cast fog cloud three times per day. This spell is used to confuse resistance or to delay attack by a superior foe. Annis can also disguise self like all hags, appearing as a tall human, ogre, or even a small giant. These spells are cast at 8th level for purposes of determining spell range, duration, etc.",
					"The skin of an annis is iron-hard; thus edged weapons cause 1 less point of damage when they hit these hags. Conversely, blunt weapons (including morning stars) cause 1 additional point of damage against an annis.",
					"Annis speak their own language, as well as ogre, all evil giant tongues, and some common. Some of the most intelligent annis can speak common fluently and know a smattering of various demihuman languages. Annis are believed to live for 500 years."

Their tails and the manes down their spines are stiff bristels, and the flesh on their bellies sags so much that older armanites sometimes look like gutted half-horses, dragging their entrails beneath them.",
					"Some breeds of armanite are more kangaroolike in their nonhuman half. Their front limbs are hands, capable of manipulating weapons and small items.",
					"All armanites wear black, fluted armor that seems more ornamental than functional. Because of their great strength, the armor is much heavier than ordinary armor and more effective than it might appear. Armanites are never without their weapons: flanged maces, wavy flamberge swords, and heavy crossbows or composite bows.",
					"HABITAT / SOCIETY",
					"Armanites are the mercenaries and scavengers of the Blood War, living by devouring the flesh and spirits of the fallen. They serve their masters well but expect plunder in return; failure to provide it results in desertion or rebellion, even on the eve of battle. Most herds of armanites specialize in a particular battlefield duty, such as scouting, foraging for quartermasters, skirmishing, archery, or the like. They never take part in sieges. Their reputation for fickleness is well earned; if they receive orders they don't like, they simply leave.",
					"Female armanites number only half that of their male counterparts. The sexes are strictly segregated for most of their lives, for they inevitably fight among themselves if allowed to mix. Males and female herds only mingle during mating, which occurs after a successful battle against the baatezu. Young are herded along with the servants and camp followers until the seize weapons of their own from a fallen member of the troupe and slay an enemy, at which point they join the adults.",
					"Each armanite troupe carries an individual troupe banner and the banner of their current master or mistress, such as Graz'zt's diagonal black-and-white slash or Pazrael's golden talon on dark red. If the banner is lost in battle, the troupe disband to take up service in the household of one of the lords of the Plain of Infinite Portals or to attempt to join annother troupe. The banner is the symbol and unifying principle of each warband; without it, the armanites feud among themselves and soon their group falls apart.",
					"Because they operate well as independent groups, armenites are often selected to undertake special missions for the Abyssal lords. They are called the Dark Horsemen or the Dark Riders in the Upper Planes and are feared there. They are a common sight in Sigil as well, where they sometimes serve as bloodthirsty bodyguards.",
					"ECOLOGY",
					"Armanites devour the blood and spirits of their fallen foes, rendering them unresurrectable, and some stories say that they prefer this sustenance to any other. Their favorite prey are varrangoin, baatezu, and yugoloths, in that order. Some armanites take on rutterkin as grooms, smiths, riding auxiliaries, and servants, though this is rare. They despise all forms of least tanar'ri and abuse them mercilessly.",
					"Armanites prefer raucous, chaotic group combat to formal duels or feats of arms. They often brawl like warhounds in the halls and citadels of the tanar'ri, and provoking a fight with one armanite means a grudge match with the entire troupe. Armanites despise the bariaur and attack them on sight."

					"The gods alone know what these things are or where they come from, bot one thing is certain: Where the astral dreadnought goes, even the most powerful fiends know fear. The astral dreadnought's a gigantic creature the size of a storm giant, with gaping jaws; huge, pincerlike claws; a reddish, armored carapace; and a single, black, malevolent eye. The dreadnought's lower quarters are serpentine or wormlike, but some cutters who've seen one claim that its \"tail\" has no end, stretching off into an infinitely long silver cord as thick as a stout barrel. If this is true, it'd imply that the astral dreadnought is not a native of this plane and is projecting its spirit into the Silver void from some prime-material world.",
					"The dreadnought's sole interest appears to be feeding on any astral traveler unlucky enough to cross its path. No one has managed to communicate with the dreadnought and lived to tell the tale.",
					"HABITAT / SOCIETY",
					"Fortunately, astral dreadnoughts're exceedingly rare. In fact, some sages argue that only one of the creatures can exist at any given time. The dreadnought roams the Astral Plane without cease, searching for prey. The creature appears to be joined with the plane on a level not fully understood by other beings: sages have theorized that the dreadnought is of the Astral, not on it. This property allows it to avoid or ignore phenomena such as shifting conduits, ether cyclones, and similar hazards.",
					"ECOLOGY",
					"The dreadnought has a very unusual and specific diet: It devours astral bodies. The monster is uninterested in creatures who are physically present in the Silver Void, so characters who are plane shifted, probability travelling, or present in the Astral by means of a magical device are beneath the notice of the dreadnought. On the other hand, characters who are astrally projecting form the basis of the monster's diet. The astral dreadnought usually destroys and then devours the astral body, but doesn't strike at the silver cord except as it may be incidental to the process of devouring the astral character.",
					"The dreadnought's encountered only when an astral body is nearby. It doesn't bother physical travelers unless they happen to get between it and its prey."

					"The azer are a race of humanoid creatures that normally inhabit the Elemental Plane of Fire. Except under special circumstances, they are very rarely found on the Prime Material Plane.",
					"In appearance they are much like dwarves, except that they have metallic, brass-colored skin and flames for hair. They wear only kilts or apronlike garments of beaten brass, copper, or bronze.",
					"HABITAT / SOCIETY",
					"Azer on their home plane are part of an extremely regimented society where every individual has his or her place. The azer civilization in general is heavily stratified, with law taking precedence over individual freedoms and even an individual's life.",
					"Azer construct their outposts and cities as towers built from basalt, granite, or metal. There they dwell in small groups, using their plentiful complexes of flames to shape the stone.",
					"They grow strange trees with metallic outer skins or barks, and the leaves of these trees are actually made entirely of metal in some cases, precious metals.",
					"Azer are unfriendly and taciturn, and they lack compassion. They capture and interrogate intruders; particularly dangerous or violent prisoners are slain. They are greedy, particularly for gems that are a clear purple or red (rubies, amethysts, garnets, etc.). Once given, the word of an azer is a solid bond.",
					"ECOLOGY",
					"It is not known just what if anything azer eat. On their home plane, their only enemies are other intelligent fire dwelling creatures, and even then this enmity is not related to relative position on the food chain. The greatest of their enemies are the efreet, who sometimes fight wars of conquest against the azer, taking their territories and making slaves of them. The azer defend themselves and their towers with powerful, bellows-like air projectors and special containers used to pour elemental water on attackers.",

					"The banshee or groaning spirit, is the spirit of an evil female elf a very rare thing indeed. Banshee hate the living, finding their presence painful, and seek to harm whomever they meet.",
					"Banshees appear as floating, luminous phantasms of their former selves. Their image glows brightly at night, but is transparent in sunlight (advantage on stealth check). Most banshees are old and withered, but a few who died young retain their former beauty. The hair of a groaning spirit is wild and unkempt. Her dress is usually tattered rags. Her face is a mask of pain and anguish, but hatred and ire burns brightly in her eyes. Banshees frequently cry out in pain hence their name.",
					"HABITAT / SOCIETY",
					"Banshees loathe all living things and thus make their homes in desolate countryside or ancient ruins. There they hide by day, when they cannot keen, and wander the surrounding countryside by night. The land encircling a groaning spirit's lair is strewn with the bones of beasts who heard the groaning spirit's cry. Once a groaning spirit establishes her lair she will remain there.",
					"The treasure of groaning spirits varies considerably and often reflects what they loved in life. Many hoard gold and fine gems. Other groaning spirits, particularly those that haunt their former homes, show finer tastes, preserving great works of art and sculptures, or powerful magical items.",
					"It is nearly impossible to distinguish the cry of a groaning spirit from that of a human or elf woman in pain. Many a knight gallant has mistaken the two sounds, and then paid for the mistake with his life. Banshees are exceptionally intelligent and speak numerous languages, including common, elvish, and other demihuman languages.",
					"Banshees occasionally use their destructive powers to seek revenge against their former adversaries in life.",
					"ECOLOGY",
					"Banshees are a blight wherever they settle. They kill without discretion, and their only pleasure is the misfortune and misery of others. In addition to slaying both man and beast, a groaning spirit's keen has a powerful effect upon vegetation. Flowers and delicate plants wither and die and trees grow twisted and sickly, while hardier plants, thistles and the like, flourish. After a few years all that remains within five miles of a groaning spirit's lair is a desolate wilderness of warped trees and thorns mixed with the bones of those creatures that dared to cross into the groaning spirit's domain."

					"On Phlegethos, the fourth layer of Baator, the pit fiend Gazra lives in a crystal castle. The hamatula cast captured intruders into the cells under the castle for torture. Gazra oversees the first four layers of Baator with an army of 5,000 hamatula. Twenty hamatula with maximum hit points guard him at all times. Loyal service to their lord is the fastest way to rise in status.",

					"Hamatula are doubly unique among the baatezu because only they produce a useful byproduct. A gland behind their ears produces a powerful hallucinogen that is \"harvested\" by greater baatezu and used to torment and interrogate prisoners. A few brave (or wealthy) sages have obtained samples of this secretion, though not enough to perform any meaningful experiments. They believe that greater quantities of this secretion could produce an extremely potent potion of illusion."

					"DESCRIPTION",
					"Of the various monsters that inhabit the rifts of the plane of Gehenna, the barghest is certainly the most common and one of the most fearsome. The barghest's natural shape is very much the same as that of a large goblin, and when dwelling among goblins, it generally retains that form.",
					"While it appears to be a large goblin when it is a whelp, its skin darkens from yellow to a bluish-red as it grows larger and stronger, and eventually its skin turns an even blue at adulthood. The eyes of the monster glow orange when it is excited, but otherwise they are indistinguishable from those of a normal goblin.",
					"A barghest is also able to assume at will the form of a large war dog or a wild dog. Hence, the creature has oftentimes been referred to as a \"devil-dog\", but this is a misnomer. The precise form taken can vary from creature to creature, but all forms are those of typical wild or war dogs, and it is almost impossible (95% unlikely) to tell one from its natural counterpart. However, natural dogs instantly recognize, fear, and hate a barghest, and they will attack it at any opportunity.",
					"HABITAT / SOCIETY",
					"These beings are native to Gehenna and tend to live in isolation on that plane. There, each barghest has its own stronghold and force of servitors, over which it rules despotically. Goblins readily recognize and worship barghests (even in their goblinoid form), but other races find them to be virtually indistinguishable from these common prime-material monsters. The goblin hosts fear and serve the barghests, often going to great lengths to bring them suitable gifts and sacrifices, and the barghests respond by slaying powerful enemies of the goblins as well as generally enriching the goblins' treasure hoards.",
					"Occasionally, a barghest on Gehenna will spawn a litter of six young, which are immediately sent to the Prime Material Plane to feed and grow. Those that survive eventually return to Gehenna, but while they are away, they must feed upon humans and demihumans. Barghest whelps are found either alone or in pairs or the Prime Material Plane, generally living near isolatea communities of humans or with bands of goblins.",
					"When barghest whelps first come to the Prime Material, they are relatively weak, having only 6 Hit Dice. However, for every energy (experience) level of human (or demihuman) life that they slay or devour, 1 hit point is added to their overall total. Once they absorb eight levels, they gain another Hit Die. Note that 0-level characters are worth only one-half of an experience level to the barghest, so they are considerably less attractive targets than high-level heroes. In addition, each time a barghest gains a Hit Die, its Armor Class and Strength score increases by 1. When the barghest finally achieves full growth and power, it discovers the ability to plane shift to Gehenna, where it seeks its own reeking valley rift to lord over.",
					"What treasure barghests gather into their own strongholds in Gehenna is unknown, although it is rumored to be great. However, while they live upon the Prime Material Plane, they accumulate no personal treasure.",
					"ECOLOGY",
					"The barghest passes through different stages in its life. As a whelp it is a hunter and tracker consigned to the Prime Material Plane. There it grows in cunning and wisdom until it is ready to enter into the next stage of its life. At this phase it returns to Gehenna and becomes a leader. It is still a hunter, though now its tactics and attitudes are greater, to match the game other intelligent beings that it hunts."

Their fur is a deep, red dish brown and their skin, where exposed, is grayish brown They have frightening visages and six digits per limb, sharp, wicked claws extending from each digit. They shamble along the ground using both arms and legs for movement, but prefer to move among trees, rafters, vines, etc., for they have increased movement there.",

					"In certain areas of the Abyss, the bar-lgura form tribes of 300 or more. These societies divorce themselves from the day to day dealings of the Abyss and form their own crude \"government\", the only government in the Abyss. Tribal bar-lgura do not obey other tanar'ri, for their numbers protect them from the wrath of the true tanar'ri. Still, there are tales of a balor summarily laying waste to an entire tribe of rebellious barlgura.",

					"Barlgura are not quite beasts, but are not terribly intelligent. They do not hate baatezu as do other tanar'ri. The closest thing to animals among the tanar'ri, they receive especially cruel treatment by more powerful tanar'ri when they get out of line."

					"DESCRIPTION",
					"The behir is a snake-like reptilian monster whose dozen legs allow it to move with considerable speed and climb at fully half its normal movement rate. It can fold its limbs close to its long, narrow body and slither in snake-fashion if it desires. The head looks more crocodilian than snake-like, but has no difficulty in opening its mouth wide enough to swallow prey whole, the way a snake does.",
					"Behir have band-like scales of great hardness. Their color ranges from ultramarine to deep blue with bands of gray-brown. The belly is pale blue. The two large horns curving back over the head look dangerous enough but are actually used for preening the creature's scales and not for fighting.",
					"HABITAT / SOCIETY",
					"Behir are solitary creatures, meeting others of their kind only to mate and hatch a clutch of 1d4 eggs. The female guards these eggs for eight months while the male hunts for the pair. When the young hatch, they are immediately turned out of the nest to fend for themselves, and the adults separate.",
					"Newly hatched behir are about 2 feet long. Behir grow at a rate of 8 feet per year until fully mature. Interestingly enough, newly hatched behir do not have all of their legs, having instead only six or eight. Additional pairs of legs grow slowly over time until the creature has its full complement when it reaches adulthood.",
					"Behir range over a territory of about 400 square miles, often living high up a cliff face in a cave.",
					"Behir are never friendly with dragonkind, and will never be found coexisting in the same geographical area with any type of dragon. If a dragon should enter a behir's territory, the behir will do everything it can to drive the dragon out. If the behir fails in this task, it will move off to find a new home. A behir will never knowingly enter the territory of a dragon.",
					"ECOLOGY",
					"Behir are useful to mages, priests, and alchemists for a number of concoctions. The horns of a behir can be used to brew the ink necessary to inscribe a lightning bolt scroll, and the sharp talons can likewise be used by a cleric to make the ink for a neutralize poison scroll. The heart of the behir is one of the more common ingredients for ink for a protection from poison scroll.",

Otherwise, there is a 30% chance that there will be from 1d8 pieces of jewelry and a 10% chance that a single small magical object of an indegistible nature may be found. Such objects are never found in a behir's lair, because the creature expels this waste and buries it elsewhere.",

					"DESCRIPTION",
					"The berbalang is a dark and evil creature that spends most of its life in a comatose state while its spirit wanders the Astral plane. When it does return to our world, it does so only to feed on the flesh of humans who dwell near its hiding place.",
					"A typical berbalang is a gaunt biped with black, leathery skin. Its wide, glowing eyes, which provide the berbalang with truesight out to 120 feet, are watery and white in color. Two broad, bat-like wings sprout from the creature's back and enable it to fly with great speed and agility.",
					"HABITAT / SOCIETY",
					"The berbalang is a most unusual creature. The vast majority of its life is spent in a death-like trance that permits the monster's spirit to wander at will throughout the Astral plane. Here the berbalang stalks those creatures that are weaker than itself and engages in its complex courtship and mating rituals.",
					"If the body is discovered or disturbed in any way, the berbalang is aware of this and returns to defend itself. Because of the great distance which the berbalang's spirit may have to cross to reach its material form, however, this can take quite a long time (1d100 rounds). If the body is destroyed before the berbalang can defend itself, the astral spirit is also slain. For this reason, the berbalang does its best to seclude and protect the resting place of its physical form.",
					"Once per month, on the three days of the full moon, the berbalang returns to the Prime Material plane to feed. At this time, the creature alters its trance slightly and manifests an exact duplicate of itself, known as a projection. Once the projection is formed, it is sent forth in search of the berbalang's only food a freshly slain human being.",
					"The projection, which is controlled directly by the berbalang, can travel up to three miles from its body. If the projection must fight, it does so just as the berbalang itself would (see above).",
					"If the projection is hit or suffers any injury during its quest for food, it takes flight at once and flees. As quickly as possible, the berbalang guides its projection back to its resting place. If the projection is destroyed, there is a 75% chance that the shock to the berbalang's system will prove to be fatal for it as well. If the projection is only injured, but not slain, the berbalang cannot manifest another for a number of days equal to the number of hit points it lost.",
					"When the projection returns to its master, it is dissipated. Adventurers who have followed the projection to finish it off may well be shocked to find themselves confronted by a healthy berbalang.",
					"If the berbalang is not discovered and destroyed, it will eventually seek to avenge itself upon those who interfered with its feeding. Although there may be a lull while the body of the berbalang recovers from the shock of the attack on its projection and is able to send forth another, retribution is a certainty.",
					"If the projection was forced back to the body or destroyed before it could find prey to feed upon, the berbalang will send forth another, as soon as it is able, to satisfy its hunger (regardless of the phase of the moon) before seeking its revenge.",
					"ECOLOGY",
					"When the projection kills a human, it picks up the corpse and begins to return with it to its lair. As it does so, the berbalang itself awakens from its trance and the projection begins to feed on the body. By the time the projection has reached the berbalang's hiding place, the body has been all but stripped of flesh and the berbalang's hunger has been satisfied.",
					"In order to avoid drawing attention to itself, the berbalang usually moves its lair every three or four months. At this time, it moves only during the night and avoids any confrontation if it can. Thus actual contact with the berbalang itself, as opposed to its projection, is minimal.",
					"There is no record of anyone discovering how the berbalang is able to derive sustenance when only its projection feeds on the slain humans it hunts. Likewise, the exact process by which the berbalang is able to mate and reproduce when its only contact with others of its species takes place in a spiritual form on the Astral plane remains a mystery."

					"DESCRIPTION",
					"The bheur, or blue hag, of Rashemaar legend is said to be the bringer of winter, capable of spreading deadly cold over a wide area. Rashemaar tales are uncertain whether there is only one bheur or many, but in all stories she is a powerful and malevolent creature who serves the useful purpose of helping to bring winter. She is invariably defeated add driven off each spring.",
					"In most stories the bheur resembles a hidepus, wrinkled old crone with pale blue-white skin and snow-white hair, wrapped in a tattered gray-blue shawl. She carries a gnarled gray staff taller than she is, and her voice howls of icy winds.",
					"Some stories tell of the bheur and orglash (ice spirits) working in concert to mislead, attack, and devour travelers. No one knows whether these tales of cooperation bepeen the blue hag and orglash are true; witnesses are unlikely to live to tell the tale.",
					"Other legends speak of epic battles betweqn high-ranking wychlaran (the Witches of Rashemen) and thy bheur, and of the early onset of spring as a result of victory by the Witches. The Witches themselves believe that the bheur is a natural part of the land and serves a useful purpose, but they will fight the blue hag if she begins to act arbitrarily or cruelly. As the Witches say, winter is the best part of the year, but even winter pales in the month of Hammer.",
					"HABITAT / SOCIETY",
					"Some claim that the bheur themselves bring the cold, others that the cold draws the bheur.",
					"As the skies turn slate-gray and snow swirls down from the sky, driven on howling winds, the Rashemaar shut their doors tightly, make certain that they have laid in enough wood and food for the winter, and cower in the terrible weather. During this time the bheur is abroad, and most Rashemaar fear her greatly. Like the dreaded uthraki shapechanging spirits, hheur prefer to prey upon lone travelers, freezing them and devouring their frozen bodies. The bheur is also said to sneak into people's homes if the doors and windows are not proper sealed, where they snatch away young children or unsuspecting residents. Such stories are probably cautionary tales against leaving windows and doors open, but they usually do the job keeping young Rashemaar in line for fear of the blue hag.",
					"ECOLOGY",
					"No one has ever seen two blue hags together, leading to a widespread belief that there is only one bheur in all of Rashemen. After freezing victims, the bheur dines on the icy corpses, and it is said that anyone who sees a bheur devour its victim may be struck blind or driven mad. Characters who witness such an act must successfully save vs. death magic or be blinded (75%) or driven insane (25%). Insane characters flee (50%), attack anyone nearby, friend or foe (30%), or collapse in a catatonic heap, incapable of speech or movement (20%). The madness lasts 2d6 days unless the victim receives a cure disease or {@spell remove curse} spell."

They also are graceful in flight; however, they prefer to fly at night when their great forms are hidden by the darkness of the sky.

However, if it appears the adults' lives are in jeopardy they will abandon their young to save themselves.",

					"COMBAT",
					"Boars are dangerous foes when angered. They have a vicious bite and those with tusks can employ them to rip at unprotected flesh with great effectiveness.",

					"HABITAT / SOCIETY",
					"Boars live in family units as a rule. If more than one wild boar is encountered the others will be sows with Hit Points 6 (1d8+1); +2 to hit 1d4 slashing damage or sounders, with a no combat abilities.",
					"ECOLOGY",
					"Boars are true omnivores who will eat virtually anything. While eating a variety of foods is generally considered healthy, in the case of the wild boar this can lead to problems. A small roundworm, Trichinella spiralis, is a parasite that can inhabit a boar's body. This creates a problem when a human eats the boar without cooking it properly, as trichinosis, the disease caused by this parasite, is easily transmissible to humans. Once infected with the parasite, the host suffers fever, sweating, and sore muscles until cured.",
					"Whether domesticated or not, the boar provides a number of products useful to man. All three varieties listed here are edible. Boar lard can be used interchangeably with domesticated swine lard. Leather from the wild specimen can be used for gloves and comfortable leather armor. The stiff bristles can be used for brushes."

Helen's lawful husband, Diomed the swordsman, went to the palace of the dark lord and demanded his wife. Basiliedus, who could have killed the swordsman with a mere word or gesture, asked what he would do to win back his bride. \"Anything,\" answered Diomed.",

					"Years passed, and Helen sickened and died, escaping at last the loveless union forced on her. One day a cowled man, evidently a rich merchant, came to Basiliedus' castle. He claimed to have a present for the hated lord. The cowled one was shown into Basiliedus' audience chamber.",
					"\"I have brought you this,\" said the visitor. He poured soil from a black silk bag onto the floor. The soil became blood, and the blood became snakes. Basiliedus knew this was soil from the Abyss, but before he could act, the visitor removed his cowl. The sight of the bodak killed all within, and Diomed, the bodak, walked outside the castle to tell the people their dread lord was dead. The sun scorched his impure flesh, but just before the rotting mass fell, Diomed is said to have smiled\".",
					"Bodaks are humanoids with gray, pearly skin and hairless; muscular bodies of no apparent gender. Their eyes are empty and milky-white, deeply set into their long, distorted features.",
					"Bodaks are only vaguely humanoid in appearance, but sometimes retain some small feature of the mortal they once were. This may manifest itself in a nervous twitch, a peculiar combat style, or anything else that the bodak may have possessed during its normal lifetime.",
					"Bodaks have no language of their own. They speak the language common to the tanar'ri and their dark servants, and generally they remember a few words of the common speech.",

They are 3-foot-tall hairless humanoids with rubbery hides that range in color from dark gray to blackish-blue. They have large bulbous bald heads with large ears; the rest of their body parts are dispropartionate and vary from individual to individual. For example, their noses may be be large and misshapen, broad and flat, mere slits, and so forth. Arms, legs, hands, feet, torso, and abodomen vary from spindly to oversized and misshapen. They can stretch and compress their bodies to an amazing degree.",

					"HABITAT / SOCIETY",
					"Boggles are a cowardly lot and tend to be whiners if threatened with violence. They have low intelligence, but the cleverness of monkeys. They taunt, bluster, and scold with their gibbering-from a distance. Boggles do not value treasure, but they do like bright, shiny objects such as precious coins, gems and jewelry as well as bits of polished junk, and can be tempted with food and sweets.",
					"The social organization of boggles is loosely familial. A gen of 2d4 adults and young live in a pocket warren, which might require the boggle dimensional rift ability to enter. Boggle kids tend to be more roly-poly than their adult counterparts and roll and bounce about rather than running. Old boggles are extremely rare, as they tend to lose their sight, sense of smell, and elasticity as they age.",
					"A boggle nest is usually a pit-marked cavern, an earthen burrow or den, or a hideway hollowed in a wall. Here, boggles build claylike frames and cubbies, using their oil and the debris of their digging to form a mortar, like a mud wasp's nest. Their treasures might be found here in some walled-off cubby.",
					"ECOLOGY",
					"Boggles scavenge their food, existing on organic refuse, insects, plants and lichens, and kills stolen from other predators. They seem particularly fond of ants, grubs, and sweets, and can be enticed with a bit of a bribe. Boggles sometime herd beetles, slugs, and lizards in their nests.",
					"The boggles' innate survival instinct combined with their slipperiness and special abilities makes them difficult to capture. Other races, such as goblins, hobgoblins, and orcs have been known to use boggles as watchdogs and trackers because of their sharp senses. When guard boggles sense intruders, they set up a high-pitched keening wail. Goblin boggle handlers use high frequency whistles and collars with inward turned barbs to control their boggles."

					"DESCRIPTION",
					"Bone nagas are created undead. They appear as skeletal worms with humanlike skull heads that appear larger than one would assume to be usual for their bodies. Their empty eye sockets glow with the hatred of fell unlife. Created by dark nagas and a few evil mages to serve as guardians, these spellcasting worms serve their master with absolute loyalty. Their creation is an exacting process, hence their rarity.",
					"Bone nagas do not speak. They have limitsed (60-foot range) telepathy, with which they communicate with their creator. Though they can broadcast thoughts for others to receive, they cannot use this as any sort of attack, and most of the time they prefer to shield their thoughts from others, retreating behind a screen of mental chaos whenever they feel another mind.",
					"HABITAT / SOCIETY",
					"Bone nagas are usually created by the nagara (evil nagakind, or dark nagas) to be guardians, especially of young nagas and nonmagical treasure. If their creators are destroyed or abandon them, their loyalty ends and they travel freely in the world. Such rare bone nagas may be found in ruins, subterranean areas, and deep woods, often surrounded by lesser undead they have gathered around them.",
					"ECOLOGY",
					"Bone nagas eat nothing and fill no niche in any life cycle, save that they sometimes kill large, aggressive natural predators (including humankind) for sport or to practice with their spells. Some mages have found uses for their powers bones in magic involving telepathy. Bone-naga powder can also be used as a substitute for powdered iron (by wizards) or unholy water or smoldering dung (by priests) when making the circle for a protection from good spell (without altering the spell's casting or effects in any way)."

					"BUGBEAR's TACTICS (read the article)",
					"DESCRIPTION",
					"Bugbears are giant, hairy cousins of goblins who frequent the same areas as their smaller relatives.",
					"Bugbears are large and very muscular, standing 7' tall. Their hides range from light yellow to yellow brown and their thick coarse hair varies in color from brown to brick red. Though vaguely humanoid in appearance, bugbears seem to contain the blood of some large carnivore. Their eyes recall those of some savage bestial animal, being greenish white with red pupils, while their ears are wedge shaped, rising from the top of their heads. A bugbear's mouth is full of long sharp fangs.",
					"Bugbears have a nose much like that of a bear with the same fine sense of smell. It is this feature which earned them their name, despite the fact that they are not actually related to bears in any way. Their tough leathery hide and long sharp nails also look something like those of a bear, but are far more dexterous.",
					"The typical bugbear's sight and hearing are exceptional, and they can move with amazing agility when the need arises. Bugbear eyesight extends somewhat into the infrared, giving them darkvision out to 60 feet.",
					"The bugbear language is a foul sounding mixture of gestures, grunts, and snarls which leads many to underestimate the intelligence of these creatures. In addition, most bugbears can speak the language of goblins and hobgoblins.",
					"HABITAT / SOCIETY",
					"Bugbears prefer to live in caves and in underground locations. A lair may consist of one large cavern or a group of caverns. They are well-adapted to this life, since they operate equally well in daylight and darkness.",
					"Leader",
					"If a lair is uncovered and 12 or more bugbears are encountered they will have a leader. These individuals have 38 hit points (7d8+7), Armor Class of 17 and Strength 17.",
					"Chief",
					"If 24 or more bugbears are encountered, they will have a chief in addition to their leaders. Chiefs have 50 hit points (9d8+9), Armor Class of 18, and Strength 18. Each chief will also have a sub-chief who is identical to the leaders described above.",
					"In a lair, half of the bugbears will be females and young who will not fight except in a life or death situation. If they are forced into combat, the females attack as hobgoblins and the young as kobolds.",
					"The species survives primarily by hunting. They have no compunctions about eating anything they can kill, including humans, goblins, and any monsters smaller than themselves. They are also fond of wine and strong ale, often drinking to excess.",
					"Bugbears are territorial, and the size of the domains vary with the size of the group and its location. It may be several square miles in the wilderness, or a narrow, more restricted area in an underground region.",
					"Intruders are considered a valuable source of food and treasure, and bugbears rarely negotiate. On occasion, they will parley if they think they can gain something exceptional by it. Bugbears sometimes take prisoners to use as slaves.",
					"Extremely greedy, bugbears love glittery, shiny objects and weapons. They are always on the lookout to increase their hoards of coins, gems, and weapons through plunder and ambush.",
					"ECOLOGY",
					"Bugbears have two main goals in life: survival and treasure. They are superb carnivores, winnowing out the weak and careless adventurer, monster and animal. Goblins are always on their toes when bugbears are present, for the weak or stupid quickly end up in the stewpot."

					"DESCRIPTION",
					"Aptly called a landshark, the bulette (pronounced Boo-lay) is a terrifying predator that lives only to eat. The bulette is universally shunned, even by other monsters.",
					"It is rumored that the bulette is a cross between an armadillo and a snapping turtle, but this is only conjecture.",
					"The bulette's head and hind portions are blue-brown, and they are covered with plates and scales ranging from gray-blue to blue-green. Nails and teeth are dull ivory. The area around the eyes is brown-black, the eyes are yellowish and the pupils are blue green.",
					"HABITAT / SOCIETY",
					"Fortunately for the rest of the world, the bulette is a solitary animal, although mated pairs (very rare) will share the same territory. In addition, other predators rarely share a territory with a landshark for fear of being eaten. The bulette has no lair, preferring to wander over its territory, above and below ground, burrowing down beneath the soil to rest. Since their appetites are so voracious, each landshark has a large territory that can range up to 30 square miles.",
					"Bulettes consume their victims, clothing, weapons, and all, and the powerful acids in the stomach quickly digest the armor, weapons, and magical items of their victims. They are not above nibbling on chests or sacks of coins either, the bulette motto being eat first and think later. When everything in the territory is eaten, the bulette will move on in search of a new territory. The sole criteria for a suitable territory is the availability of food, so a bulette will occasionally stake out a new territory near human and halfling territories and terrorize the residents.",
					"Very little is known of the life cycle of the bulette. They presumably hatch from eggs, but no young have ever been found, though small landsharks of 6 Hit Dice have been killed. It may be that the bulette is hatched from very small eggs, with few young surviving to maturity. Still other sages theorize that the bulette bears live young. There is also evidence that the bulette, like carp and sharks, grow larger as they get older, for unusually large landsharks of 11 feet tall and taller have been seen. Certainly no one has ever come upon the carcass of a bulette that died of old age.",
					"ECOLOGY",
					"The bulette has a devastating effect on the ecosystem of any area it inhabits. Literally nothing that moves is safe from it man, animal, or monster. In the process of hunting and roaming, the landshark will uproot trees of considerable size. In hilly and rocky regions, the underground movements of the bulette can start small landslides. Ogres, trolls, and even some giants all move off in search of greener and safer pastures when a bulette appears.",
					"A bulette can turn a peaceful farming community into a wasteland in a few short weeks, for no sane human or demihuman will remain in a region where a bulette has been sighted.",
					"There is only one known benefit to the existence of the bulette: The large plates behind its head make superb shields, and dwarven smiths can fashion them into shields of +1 to +3 in value. Some also claim that the soil through which a bulette has passed becomes imbued with magical, rock-dissolving properties. Many would argue, however, that these benefits are scarcely worth the price.",
					"Bulette is employed as material component to empower the following spells: {@spell Jump}, {@spell Mage Armor}"

On a successful save, the disease ends. On a failed save, the target's hit point maximum is reduced by 4 ({@dice 1d8}). The target dies if its hit point maximum is reduced to 0."

					"DESCRIPTION",
					"Bulezau tanar'ri are born and bred to fight in the Blood War. With the exception of the vrocks, bulezau are the toughest front-line troops of the tanar'ri hordes. Bulezau are used as heavy infantry, assault leaders, and personal guards; they lack the mobility or magical prowess of a similar band of vrocks, but they're strong and fearless bashers who're too stubborn and stupid to ever give up.",
					"A bulezau resembles a minotaur, but it's gaunt and skeletal, and its flesh is filthy and diseased. The creature isn't covered with fur, but instead with patches of wiry bristles over battered, boil-covered skin. Its feet are clawed, not hoofed, and it has a long, serpentine tail with a clump of iron-hard spines at its end. The bulezau's horns and head are more ramlike than bull-like, and its mouth is filled with small, needle-sharp fangs. Bulezau are often armed with great tridents, pole arms, or morning stars of wicked design.",
					"Bulezau can speak the common trade-jargon of the planes with difficulty or communicate with a weak form of telepathy at will. It's a good idea for a cutter to make out like he understands the bulezau perfectly no matter how animallike its speech is, since it's not a patient basher. If a bulezau decides it's easier to tear the arms off a sod than talk to him it won't wait long to act on its impulses.",
					"HABITAT / SOCIETY",
					"Bulezau are quarrelsome, bullying creature that often fall into lethal disagreements with each other. Only the authority of a powerful greater or true tanar'ri can keep them from each other's throats, and even then only if the promise of battle is near. Bulezau live for combat, and regard all other activities as a waste of time. They make poor pickets, sentries, or scouts since they've got no patience for waiting around or attempts at stealth if a bulezau sees an enemy, it charges, and if it doesn't see an enemy, it goes looking for one.",
					"Bulezau may be difficult troops to keep control of, but they're very good at what they do. Once committed to a battle, they hold nothing back and plunge into the thick of the fight with reckless abandon. For a tanar'ri commander, the bulezau are a slavering band of maniacs that'll attempt any attack and never retreat, no matter how long the odds are. Loyalty of that kind is hard to find in the Abyss, even if it's uncontrollable bloodlust instead of iron discipline.",
					"Tanar'ri commanders've long recognized that it's a good idea to keep bulezau near the war front. They're just too stupid and aggressive to remain in a noncombat situation for long.",
					"With a strong and charismatic commander, bulezau can hold themselves in check just barely. High-ups in the Abyss sometimes create a ruthless and fanatical guard of bulezau, deciding that it's worth the headaches to have such capable and loyal (for tanar'ri) fighters at their back and call.",
					"ECOLOGY",
					"It's rumored that the tanar'ri lord Baphomet, the patron demipower of minotaurs, was responsible for the creation of the bulezau. The chant goes that Baphomet bred his minotaur servants with some of the tanar'ri in his service, but there's no way to know if this's a peel or not. It's also said that Baphomet maintains a bodyguard of fierce bulezau of unusual loyalty and discipline.",
					"Bulezau are generally well-regarded by tanar'ri of higher station, since bulezau pursue the Blood War with so much enthusiasm that a more subtle tanar'ri can drop out of sight when they're around. Tanar'ri commanders place a high value on bulezau formations and go out of their way to gather such units when possible. On the other hand, less powerful tanar'ri rarely want to be anywhere near a bulezau since the creature's likely to fly off into a murderous rage at the least provocation, regardless of the consequence. There've been engagements where more dretches and rutterkin were lost to bulezau impatience than to baatezu action.",
					"Bulezau've got a bitter rivalry with vrocks, and encounters between the two almost always break out into a fight unless there are baatezu nearby to deal with."

					"DESCRIPTION",
					"The bullywugs are a race of bipedal, frog-like amphibians. They inhabit swamps, marshes, meres, or other dank places.",
					"Bullywugs are covered with smooth, mottled olive green hide that is reasonably tough. They can vary in size from smaller than the average human to about seven feet in height. Their faces resemble those of enormous frogs, with wide mouths and large, bulbous eyes; their feet and hands are webbed. Though they wear no clothing, all bullywugs use weapons, armor, and shields if they are available. Bullywugs have their own language and the more intelligent ones can speak a limited form of the common tongue.",
					"HABITAT / SOCIETY",
					"More intelligent than frogs, all bullywugs live in organized or semi-organized socially fascist groups, cooperating for the purpose of hunting and survival. They live primarily on fish and any other game, preferring a diet of meat. They are adept hunters and fisherman, and skilled in the use and construction of snares and nets.",
					"Bullywug society is a savage one. Males are the dominant sex, and females exist only to lay eggs. Though females and young make up about one-half of any tribe, they count for little in the social order. The only signs of respect that bullywugs ever bestow are toward their leader and their bizarre frog god. The race totally lacks any higher emotions or feelings.",
					"The leader of a bullywug community is a large individual with 18 hit points. Communities of 30 or more bullywugs have five subleaders (16 hp each) and a powerful leader (3 HD, 27 hp, strenght 14). Communities of 60 or more bullywugs have a chieftain (4 HD, 36 hp, strenght 14) and five subchieftains (3 HD, 27 hp, strenght 14).",
					"All bullywugs favor dank, dark places to live, since they must keep their skin moist. Most bullywugs live in the open and maintain only loose territorial boundaries. Ordinary bullywugs do not deal with incursions into their territory very efficiently, but they kill and eat interlopers if they can. They hate their large relatives advanced bullywugs with a passion, and make war upon them at every opportunity. Bullywugs prize treasure, though it benefits them little. They value coins and jewels, and occasionally a magical item can be found amongst their hoard.",
					"On an individual level, bullywugs lack the greed and powerlust seen in the individuals of other chaotic races, such as orcs. Fighting among members of the same group, for example, is almost nonexistent. Some would say that this is because they lack the intelligence to pick a fight, and not from a lack of spite. The tribes are lead by the dominant male, who kills and eats the previous leader when it is too old to rule. This is one of the few instances when they fight among themselves.",
					"ECOLOGY",
					"Bullywugs tend to disrupt ecosystems, rather than fill a niche in them. They do not have the intelligence to harvest their food supplies sensibly and will fish and hunt in an area until its natural resources are depleted, and then move on to a new territory. They hate men, and will attack them on sight, but fortunately prefer to dwell in isolated regions far from human beings.",
					"Bullywug is employed as material component to empower the following spells: {@spell Jump}"

Camels can withstand the rigors of desert terrain well but require careful, experienced handling. A camel's humps allow it to go without food or water for up to two weeks.",
					"Camels are tall, spindly mounts, with padded feet and awkward saddles perched before their humps. Their fur varies from white to pale tan to deep brown and from short, desert hair to shaggy mountain camel fur. The rarer white camels bring two to 5 times the usual price, as they are considered lucky. Desert, racing, and war camels are all of the one-hump variety; mountain camels have two humps.",
					"COMBAT",
					"Nasty-tempered camels have a 50% chance of spitting at persons attempting to ride them or use them as pack animals. The victim of a spit attack has a 25% chance of being blinded for 1d3 rounds.",
					"If frightened, there is a 25% chance that a herd of camels will stampede. If a herd stampedes, roll 2d4 for each creature in the path of the stampede who does not take cover (such as by hiding in a tree or behind a rock pile or wall). This is the number of camels trampling the exposed creature. Trampling causes 1d6 points of damage per camel. Trampled opponents cannot regain their feet until the stampede passes.",
					"HABITAT / SOCIETY",
					"Breeding camels of all types are especially valued. Camels bear only a single offspring each year, and strong and well-tempered animals are pampered to produce as many as possible before their breeding days are done. Like horses, camels can have grades of quality.",
					"ECOLOGY",
					"Camels eat grass, grains, and shrubbery. They can carry heavy loads for long periods of time. Camels are loaded while kneeling, and they often refuse to get up under more than their encumbered load.",
					"War Camel",
					"Suitable for most types of warfare, these animals are trained not to shy away from blood and mayhem.",
					"They attack with their bite (1d4 + 3 bludgeoning damage) and with their hooves, which cause 1d6 + 3 bludgeoning damage each. If successful, the hoof attacks force the opponent to remain prone. War camels are usually culled from the strongest members of a group of desert camels and then trained intensively for several years. In some cases, however, they are bred exclusively from retired war camels, thus improving the line.",
					"Desert Camel",
					"With their wide, padded feet and fat-rich, watery humps, desert camels are ideal mounts for traveling through the wastes. They are slow but steady animals, capable of taking heavy loads through difficult climates and terrain. They sway more and have a longer, more rolling gait than horses.",
					"Mountain Camel",
					"Mountain camels are common in the hills and mountains where they serve as pack animals. They are not useful in the desert.",
					"Racing Camel",
					"Bred for speed rather than temperament, racing camels are the most expensive and least likable camels. They are aggressive and spit often (75% of times), even at their trainers and riders. Their small hooves and long, thin legs give them incredible speed of 60 ft., but they are usually trained to accept only a very limited set of riders. A good racing camel costs at least twice as much as a war camel, and may cost much more."

					"DESCRIPTION",
					"The carrion crawler is a scavenger of subterranean areas, feeding primarily upon carrion. When such food becomes scarce, however, it will attack and kill living creatures.",
					"The crawler looks like a cross between a giant green cutworm and a cephalopod. Like so many other hybrid monsters, the carrion crawler may well be the result of genetic experimentation by a mad, evil wizard.",
					"The monster's head, which is covered with a tough hide that gives it Armor Class 16, sprouts eight slender, writhing tentacles. The body of the carrion crawler is not well protected and has an armor class of only 13. The monster is accompanied by a rank, fetid odor which often gives warning of its approach.",
					"HABITAT / SOCIETY",
					"Carrion crawlers are much-feared denizens of the underground world. They live in lairs, venturing out in search of carrion or food every few days. Some underground inhabitants such as goblins and trolls will make use of carrion crawlers by leaving the bodies of dead foes out in designated areas. This keeps the creatures at a good distance from their own homes and encourages them to \"patrol\" certain areas. Some orcs have been known to chain live prisoners near the lairs of these fearsome monsters.",
					"Carrion crawlers will sometimes live with a mate or in a small group numbering no more than 6. This does not mean that they cooperate in hunting, but merely share the same space and compete fiercely for the same food. If two crawlers have made a kill or discovered carrion, they will often fight over the food, sometimes killing one another in the process.",
					"The carrion crawler mates once a year. Several days after mating, the female will go off in search of a large kill. When she has found or killed an adequate food supply, she lays about 100 eggs among the carrion. The grubs hatch one week later and begin feeding.",
					"Maternal care ceases once the eggs have been laid and it is not uncommon for eggs to later be eaten by the female who laid them. Females die a few weeks after laying their eggs, exhausted by the effort. Males live only a short time longer, having mated with as many females as possible. Grubs have been known to consume one another in feeding frenzies, and are a favorite food of adult carrion crawlers. Few of the grubs reach maturity, but those who do have eaten voraciously and will achieve their full size in a single year. When they reach maturity, the mating cycle begins again.",
					"These monsters exist on the most basic instinctual level, having no more intelligence than earthworms or most insects. The carrion crawler is driven by two urges: food and reproduction. It has absolutely no interest in the collection of treasure.",
					"ECOLOGY",
					"The carrion crawler provides the same useful, if disagreeable, function that jackals, vultures, and crows perform. Like so many other predators carrion crawlers instinctively prey on the weak, sick, and foolish. In the long run, this has a beneficial effect on the prey, strengthening its gene pool. The carrion crawler also works wonders in over crowded caverns, quickly eliminating population problems among the weaker monsters. Thus, the life cycle of the crawler is inextricably linked to those of its prey when the prey flourishes so does the crawler.",
					"Carrion Crawler is employed as material component to empower the following spells: {@spell Poison Spray}"

Its long, snakey tail is swift and strong, and can move with blinding speed. The head of the catoblepas is perched upon a long, weak neck, and would be much like that of a warthog except that the catoblepas is uglier.",
					"HABITAT / SOCIETY",
					"For the most part, the catoblepas is a meandering creature that wanders about its swamp nibbling on marsh grasses and the like. Once a month, usually under the light of the full moon, the catoblepas seeks out meat to round out its diet. It is at this time that the catoblepas is most likely to be encountered by adventurers.",
					"The lair of the catoblepas is usually some sort of sheltered place where the ground is firm. More often than not it is surrounded by a tall stand of reeds or other marsh plants. The creature has little fear of being disturbed in its lair, since it is frequently the most feared carnivore in the swamp.",
					"The catoblepas mates for life and when more than one catoblepas is encountered they will be a mated pair. There is a 10% chance that the couple will have a single offspring with them. An immature catoblepas will have half the Hit Dice of an adult. It takes almost nine years for the offspring to reach youthful maturity and an adult female will bear but one child every 10 or 12 years. Both the male and the female will cooperate in raising the offspring.",
					"When the catoblepas ventures forth to hunt it eats fish, marsh birds, eels, water rats, large amphibians, snakes, and other swamp animals. The catoblepas usually stuns its prey with its tail and then kills it with its gaze.",
					"The catoblepas is an opportunistic predator when it hunts and it is not above eating carrion. Since it is semi-intelligent, it will treat parties of humans with respect, preferring to size them up first. As a rule, it will not attack unless it is hunting or feels that its mate or offspring is threatened. Being long-lived (150 to 200 years or so) and semi-intelligent, the catoblepas is capable of learning from the mistakes of earlier encounters and hunts.",
					"The catoblepas has no special interest in wealth, and the listed treasure type is the result of victorious encounters with intruders. It attaches no value to the coins, gems, and occasional magical items strewn about the lair.",
					"ECOLOGY",
					"The catoblepas has no natural enemies, since its gaze provides it with more than adequate protection from even the fiercest of predators."

					"DESCRIPTION",
					"The cave fisher is a large insectoid that has adapted to life below ground. It combines many of the characteristics of a spider and a lobster. The cave fisher has a hard, chitinous shell of overlapping plates and eight legs. The 6 rear legs are used for movement and traction on stony walk and corridors.",
					"Because of these limbs, the fisher has no difficulty in moving up and down vertical walls. The front pair of legs are equipped with powerful pincers, which are used for killing and dismembering prey. The most unusual feature of the cave fisher is its long snout, which can fire a strong, adhesive filament. The monster can also use its adhesive to anchor itself in place on walls and ledges.",
					"HABITAT / SOCIETY",
					"Cave fishers prefer living on ledges and caves 1ocated above well traveled paths, sharing their lairs with others of their kind. No more than four cave fishers will be found in one lair. Their filaments are always strung before their lair, and they attempt to kill anything they trap, often storing food for future use.",
					"Their territories are very small, and never larger than about 300 feet to either side of the lair. Anything man-sized or smaller is considered fair game by the cave fisher and halflings are thought to be tasty treats.",
					"A single cave fisher would never attack a large, well armed party for the sake of a single meal. Still, they are cunning, and a group of the monsters might reel in filaments and attempt an ambush if they thought they could get away with it. If hunting in one area becomes scarce, the cave fisher will simply find a new area to hunt. where the small game is more olentiful and careless. Like all predators. the cave fisher is interested in survival. This means a steady supply of food and a mate.",
					"Females lay eggs in the vicinity of the lair, which they protect from predators. The young scatter when the eggs hatch, seeking lairs of their own. Although the cave fisher does not collect treasure, its lair often strewn with the possessions of its former victims.",
					"ECOLOGY",
					"The cave fisher preys primarily on small flying game, and in the subterranean world this frequently means a diet of bats. It is not the top predator in its ecological niche, and has learned caution in dealing with other monsters.",
					"The cave fisher is sufficiently intelligent to know the dangers of preying on large well-organized groups, who might grow tired of its depredations and hunt it to extinction. The monster instinctively picks the easiest route for survival, and relies on stealth and cunning to trap its prey and avoid being eaten itself.",
					"The filaments of the cave fisher are highly prized by many thieves' guilds, for they can be made into thin and very strong rope which is nearly invisible. The filaments are wound onto reels and then specially treated to dilute the adhesive.",
					"The resulting strands are made into ropes, while the diluted adhesive is turned into a special solution, which when applied to gloves ad",
					"boots, greatly increases traction for climbing."

					"Centaurs are woodland beings who shun the company of men. They dwell in remote, secluded glades and pastures.",

					"Centaurs speak their own language and some among them (about 10%) can converse in the tongue of elves.",
					"HABITAT / SOCIETY",
					"Centaurs are sociable creatures, taking great pleasure in the society of others of their kind. Their overall organization is tribal, with a tribe divided into family groups living together in harmony. The size of the tribe varies, it range from 5 to 20 (5d4) families. Since males have the dangerous roles of hunter and protector, females outnumber males by two to one. The centaur mates for life, and the entire tribe participates in the education of the young.",
					"The lair is located deep within a forest, and consists of a large, hidden glade and pasture with a good supply of running water. Depending upon the climate, the lair may contain huts or lean-tos to shelter the individual families. Centaurs are skilled in horticulture, and have been known to cultivate useful plants in the vicinity of their lair. In dangerous, monster infested areas, centaurs will sometimes plant a thick barrier of tough thorn bushes around their lair and even set traps and snares. In the open area, away from the trees, are hearths for cooking and warmth.",
					"If encountered in their lair, there will be 1d6 additional males, females equal to twice the number of males, and 5d6 young. The females (3 Hit Dice) and the young (1d3 Hit Dice) will fight only with their hooves, and only in a life or death situation.",
					"Each tribe will have a priest who is treated as a leader but has the spell abilities of a 3rd level druid. Centaurs survive through a mixture of hunting, foraging, fishing, agriculture and trade. Though they shun dealings with humans, centaurs have been known to trade with elves, especially for food and wine. The elves are paid from the group treasury, which comes from the booty of slain monsters.",
					"The territory of a centaur tribe varies with its size and the nature of the area it inhabits. Centaurs are also not above sharing a territory with elves. The attitude of a centaur toward a stranger in its territory will vary with the visitor. Humans and dwarves will usually be asked to leave in a polite manner, while halflings or gnomes will be tolerated, and elves will be welcomed.",
					"Monsters will be dealt with in a manner according to the threat they represent to the welfare and survival of the tribe. Were a giant or dragon to enter the territory, the centaurs would pull up stakes and relocate, while trolls and orcs and their like will be killed.",
					"Centaurs will take the treasure of their fallen foes, and are fully aware of its value. Most male centaurs have a small coin supply, while the tribe has a treasury which may well include some magical items.",
					"Leaders will have twice the normal individual treasure. This treasure is used to buy food for the group, or to ransom captured or threatened members of the tribe.",
					"While basically neutral or chaotic good, centaurs have been known to become rowdy, boorish, and aggressive when under the influence of alcohol. They are also extremely protective of their females and young. Centaurs are basically pastoral, but will react with violence if their lifestyle and survival is threatened.",
					"ECOLOGY",
					"The centaur lives in close harmony with nature and spends its lifetime carefully conserving the natural resources around its lair. The race seems to have an innate knowledge of how to achieve this precious balance. If forced to chop down a tree, a centaur will plant another to replace it. Centaurs never over hunt or over fish an area as a human group might do, but choose their game with care, limiting the amount they eat."

					"DESCRIPTION",
					"Kytons are a race of creatures inhabiting the city of Jangling Hiter on the third layer of Baator. They are the city's constabulary, ferreting out transgressors. A soul knows when he's being stalked by one of these monstrosities if he hears tinkling chains and an accompanying malicious titter.",
					"Kytons are humanoid, though it's hard to tell if they're human. They wear chains in lieu of clothing and armor, using this \"apparel\" as weapons. The body, arms, and legs are all tightly wrapped with smaller chains. When a kyton raises its arms, a cutter can see dangling ropes of metal chains studded with barbs, welded scraps of iron, and other small sharp implements.",
					"The kyton's head is also wrapped with chains, covering where the hair, eyes, ears, and nose would be on a normal humanoid. The only visible features on a kyton are its throat, its grimacing mouth, and occasionally one gleaming eye. Some people might wish they hadn't seen even that much. See, the kyton has a nasty habit of assuming the feature of a departed loved one or friend or sometimes that of much-feared enemy. Though all a berk can see is the lower part of the face, he can often reconstruct the rest of it. No one's really sure whether this is an illusion the creatures create, or if it's actually the dead person come to horrible \"life\" in the city of chains.",
					"HABITAT / SOCIETY",
					"All Kytons are equal in Jangling Hiter. They don't disagree over standing, though they do squabble over choice scraps of unlucky berks. These fights are short-lived and usually end with the victor claiming the morsel. The loser fades (flees, really) into the metal jungle of the city.",
					"The only treasure a kyton has is that of its victims. That hoard can valy widely, depending on the kyton's power and the resources of its quarry.",
					"ECOLOGY",
					"Kytons are the police force of the city, enforcing its edicts and trampling those who don't live by them. It's rumored that they eat their victims, though it's been put forth that what the kytons really consume are the spirits of those they hunt. These sages speculate that kytons survive on the anguish of the screaming spirits they catch.",
					"This is conjecture, for kytons have never been studied in depth. Bloods know a captured kyton can kill itself simply by willing it. And a dead kyton dissolves, leaving behind an acrid stench and a greasy puddle of chains and ichor nothing much there to study."

					"DESCRIPTION",
					"How chimerae were created is a dark mystery better left unexplored. The chimera has the hindquarters of a large, black goat and the forequarters of a huge, tawny lion. Its body has brownish-black wings like those of a dragon.",
					"The monster has three heads, those of a goat, a lion, and a fierce dragon. The goat head is pitch black, with glowing amber eyes and long ochre horns. The lion head is framed by a brown mane and has green eyes. The dragon head is covered with orange scales and has black eyes.",
					"The chimera speaks a limited form of the foul language of red dragons. As a rule, however, it will only pause to communicate with those creatures who are more powerful than itself.",
					"HABITAT / SOCIETY",
					"The chimera, being a hybrid, combines the preferences of the lion, the goat, and the dragon in its habitat, society and ecology. The dragonish part of its nature gives the chimera a distinct preference for caves as lairs. The dragon and lion parts seem to war with one another, for some chimerae are dragon-like in their preference for solitude, while others live in small prides. Even if they mate, offspring are rare.",
					"The monster is an omnivore. The goat head will browse on the toughest plants and shrubs and will derive nutrition from the most barren vegetation while the lion and dragon heads can only be satisfied with flesh. The chimera hunts once every 3 or 4 days, using its strength and limited intelligence to gain an advantage over those it preys on. Having a voracious appetite, it sometimes roams over territories as large as 20 square miles.",
					"Being chaotic evil in nature, the chimera enjoys preying upon men, elves, dwarves, and halflings. It will even gladly attack other monsters in its search for food. Anyone entering its territory becomes prey, and will be treated accordingly.",
					"The chimera cannot resist attacking groups of travelers or monsters for another reason: its dragon nature craves the treasure that its prey might be carrying. Although it has no earthly use for it, the chimera will gather the coins of its fallen foe into a heap and roost on it like a dragon. Its hoard is nothing like that of a true dragon, however, and consists mainly of copper and silver coins, with perhaps some jewelry and a few magical items.",
					"ECOLOGY",
					"The chimera fills the role of both omnivore and a top predator in its ecosystem. It is very adaptable. During times when its prey is scarce or non-existent, the chimera can make do with a vegetarian diet.",
					"The Gorgimera",
					"The gorgimera has the hindquarters of a gorgon, forequarters of a lion, and body and wings of a red dragon. Like the chimera, it has the heads of its three constituent creatures.",
					"The monster can attack with its claws, bite with its lion and dragon heads, and butt with its gorgon head. In place of making its normal attack, the gorgon and dragon heads can employ their breath weapons. While the dragon's attack is similar to that of the chimera, the gorgon's breath causes petrification to any caught in its area of effect. The gorgon head can use its breath weapon twice per day to strike in a cone 3 feet long which is 1 foot wide at its base and 3 feet wide at its mouth. The gorgimera will always use one of its breath weapons if its foes are within 10 feet. A save vs. petrification will allow a victim to avoid the effects of the gorgon's breath.",

					"DESCRIPTION",
					"Chitines are small humanoids with four arms that build with webbing like humans build with stone or wood. This diminutive race of humanoids is most notable for its four arms which are jointed to allow for extra movement in ways that human limbs could never move. Their faces are human-looking, although they have multi-faceted eyes and mandibles protruding from their mouths. Long stringy black hair falls in a tangle from their skulls and grows down their backs, like the mane of a horse.",
					"The skin of the chitines is gray and mottled. A special oil is secreted that negates the adhesive effects of spider webbing. The palms of their hands and the soles of their feet are covered in dozens of tiny hooks, which allow them to climb textured surfaces with no loss of speed.",
					"Chitines wear clothing made from dried and processed silk. Bits of colored rocks, carved bones, and such are frequently woven throughout. They always keep their hands and feet uncovered. They carry their tools in pouches woven into their clothing. Chitines speak the language of the drow, and sometimes know a bit of other subterranean languages.",
					"HABITAT / SOCIETY",
					"Chitines are only found underground. Their cavern villages are located in the center of a maze of trap-laden webbing. The hardened webbing dwellings resemble domed houses, complete with windows and decorative shapes adorning them. These homes can be located on any surface, including the ceiling. Bridges of webbing cross the town, providing easy pathways. Suspended in the center of the cavern is usually a heartshaped temple devoted to the evil goddess Lolth.",
					"Chitines are cast-off experiments of the drow. They have increased in numbers over the centuries, and even now plot to overthrow the drow who are Lolth.s favorites. They are devoted to their spider queen and will do anything in her name. The priestesses of the chitines are rumored to be of a different and more powerful race, more akin to Lolth herself.",
					"ECOLOGY",
					"A chitine can spin sticky spider webbing at the rate of one foot per round. The webbing is spun from an orifice in its stomach. Chitines eat anything that moves, sucking the fluids from the victim and leaving the dried remains on the cavern floor underneath their temple. Chitines are hunted by both drow and driders."

					"DESCRIPTION",
					"The choker is a vicious little monster found in caves and caverns. It has mottled gray or stony brown flesh, and looks more or less humanoid-with two arms, two legs, a torso, and a head. The torso and head are as small and compact as a human baby's, but the arms and legs (and fingers!) are incredibly spindly and long. Stretched to its full length, an adult choker would stand nearly 6 feet tall.",
					"This creature's limbs are like tentacles, having cartilage but no actual bones, with numerous knobby joints. The cartilage in its fingers juts out through the skin, and is stiff and razor-sharp. Because it lacks bones for support, the choker appears bowlegged and lopes with a strange, fluid gait. The creature is not completely boneless, however; it does have a bony skull, spine, and rib cage.",
					"Chokers are vaguely intelligent and speak a primitive language.",
					"HABITAT / SOCIETY",
					"Chokers are so primitive that they do not make or use tools. They can carve through solid rock with their fingers, and their lack of bones allows them to squeeze through openings impossible even for creatures of goblin size.",
					"Because chokers are inherently shy, they would have difficulty locating mates were it not for their special call. To attract a partner, both males and females keen. This whine (which humans and others find extremely irritating) echoes through the deep caverns the chokers call home. When a choker hears the keen of a potential mate, it answers. Then each creature keens in turn to draw the other near, until at last they meet. A few months later, the female gives birth to two to six young. The family stays together for three years, until the offspring have fully matured. Once the offspring have moved on, the parents separate and seek new mates.",
					"ECOLOGY",
					"The choker has a high metabolism. It burns an enormous number of calories, especially for a creature of its light weight. Consequently it is always on the lookout for victims on which to feed, and it consumes them rapidly. (A goblin provides about two days' food, for example.)",
					"Goblins are, in fact, the choker's favorite food. Chokers devour other races, such as dwarves or humans, but prefer the meat of goblins above all else.",
					"A legend among goblins says that chokers descended from a goblin band which, beset by hardship, turned to cannibalism. Youngsters in this tribe devoured their elders. Over time, the band degenerated. With the twisting of their minds came a reshaping of their bodies; their arms grew long and their fingers steely, enabling them to better grab and strangle prey. They no longer fed upon each other, but continued to crave the flesh of normal goblins.",
					"As mentioned earlier, chokers can be driven off if their would-be victims prove an able match in combat. In areas infested with chokers, goblins and dwarves also take advantage of the chokers' caution by making a lot of noise, pounding weapons on shields and the like, to scare the chokers away. This tactic sometimes backfires, however, as the noise tends to attract other, more dangerous monsters."

The chest is overly large, with arms attached by thick knots of muscle at the shoulder. Its arms hang down to its knees, and end in short stubby fingers. It has no neck, and a large head with broad flat features. Its legs are short and bowed, with wide flat feet. A clay golem wears no clothing except for a metal or stiff leather garment around its hips. It smells faintly of clay. The golem can not speak, or make any noise. It walks and moves with a slow and clumsy gait, almost as if it were not in control over its actions.",

If a clay golem does manage to break control, it becomes a berserker, attacking everything in sight until it is destroyed. Its first action is to haste itself, if it can. Unlike the flesh golem, there is no chance to regain control of a rampaging clay golem."

					"When a cloaker is first seen, it is almost impossible to distinguish this monster from a common black cloak. The monster's back has two rows of black eye spots running down it that look much like buttons, and the two ivory-colored claws on its upper edge can easily be mistaken for bone clasps.",
					"When it unfurls itself and moves to attack, however, its true nature becomes all too obvious. At this point, its white underside is clear and the monster's face is fully visible. This face, with the glow of its two piercing, red eyes and the needle-like fangs that line its mouth, is a truly horrible sight. At this point, the monster also uncurls the whip-like tail at its trailing edge and begins to swish it back and forth in anticipation.",
					"HABITAT / SOCIETY",
					"The thought processes of cloakers are utterly alien to most other life forms. As such, they can only be communicated with by mages who have devoted long hours to training their minds in the arcane discipline necessary to understand these creatures.",
					"ECOLOGY",

Female cloud giants can be 1 to 2 feet shorter and 1,000 to 2,000 pounds lighter. Cloud giants' skin ranges in color from a milky-white tinged with blue to a light sky blue. Their hair is silvery white or brass and their eyes are an iridescent blue.",

					"A cloud giant's natural Armor Class is 14. Although they will wear no armor, these giants prize magical protection devices, and one in 20 will have such a device. Cloud giants dress in clothing made of the finest materials available and wear jewelry. Many of the giants consider their appearance an indication of their station; the more jewelry and the better the clothes, the more important the giant. Cloud giants also appreciate music, and the majority of giants are able to play one or more instruments (their favorite is the harp). Unlike most other giant races, cloud giants leave their treasure in their lairs, carrying with them only food, throwing rocks, 10-100 (10d10) coins, and a musical instrument.",

One in 10 cloud giants will have spells equivalent to a 4th level wizard, and one in 20 cloud giants will be the equivalent of a 4th level cleric.",
					"If encountered in a lair, half will be immature giants. To determine a giant's maturity, roll 1d4. A roll of 4 indicates an infant with no combat ability and hit points of ogre. Rolls of 1-3 indicate older progeny with hit dice, damage, and \"to hit\" rolls equal to that of a fire giant.",
					"The majority of cloud giants live on cloud-covered mountain peaks in temperate and sub-tropical areas. These giants make their lairs in crude castles. Only 10% of good cloud giants live in castles on enchanted clouds. All giants dwelling there are able to levitate their own weight plus 2,000 pounds three times a day, create a fog cloud three times a day, and create a wall of fog once a day.

Since it has the ability to change shape, the couatl will sometimes appear in the form of other creatures (always of good alignment).",

					"HABITAT / SOCIETY",
					"This winged serpent is native to warm, jungle-like regions but can also be found flying through the ether. Their intelligence and goodness have made them objects of reverence by the natives of the regions which they inhabit. Considered to be divine, there are many legends in which the couatl is the benefactor of mankind and the bestower of such precious gifts as agriculture and medicine. There are even shrines in certain areas dedicated to the couatl, and any who attack or harm a couatl are automatically viewed as the blackest of villains.",
					"Although solitary in nature, couatl think of themselves as a single, extended clan. This clan is led by the oldest and wisest of their numbers but assembles only in dire emergencies.",
					"Most couatl dwell alone, making their lairs in caves and abandoned buildings in remote, uninhabited regions. They hunt jungle animals for food once every fortnight or so. Many enjoy traveling, often undertaking long journeys of exploration.",
					"On rare occasions, a pair will mate for life and establish a joint lair. Unlike many other reptiles, the couatl bear live young. Births are rare, averaging only one per couple each century. Both parents participate in the rearing and education of the single offspring, and will fight to the death if their child is threatened. Young couatl reach maturity in thirty or forty years and, though some will elect to remain with their parents for as long as a century, will eventually set off in search of the couatl's never-ending quest for wisdom.",
					"Intellectually curious, all couatl have vast stores of information and enjoy learning more. When one of them learns some new and fascinating fact he will inevitably set out in search of his brethren to share and discuss it.",
					"Couatl can sometimes be persuaded to help good adventurers or give sound council. If they feel that they are being sought for frivolous reasons, they will simply fly away. They are not greedy and do not seek treasure for its own sake. Aid from a couatl may well take the form of a magical item from its hoard.",

					"DESCRIPTION",
					"The much feared crawling claw is frequently employed as a guardian by those mages and priests who have learned the secret of its creation.",
					"No single description of a crawling claw is possible as they are not uniform in appearance. Since claws are the animated remains of hands or paws of living creatures, they are apt to be found in a wide variety of shapes and sizes.",
					"HABITAT / SOCIETY",
					"Crawling claws are nothing more than the animated hands and paws of once-living creatures. As such, they have no culture or society to speak of. Despite this, crawling claws do have a limited ability to communicate with each other. This takes the form of a basic telepathic link between all the claws of a single \"batch\". Whenever one claw finds a victim, all of the others in the area who were made at the same time move in to help it.",
					"In addition, claws that have been instructed to do so can act in concert with each other to move large objects. The DM should use five pounds per claw as a reasonable limit to the weight that can be moved.",
					"ECOLOGY",
					"Crawling claws can be created by any mage or priest who has knowledge of the techniques required to do so. To begin with, the creator must assemble the severed limbs that are to animated. The maximum number of claws that can be created at any one time is equal to the level of the person enchanting them. The hands (or paws) can be either fresh, skeletal, or at any stage of decomposition in between.",
					"Claws can be controlled in one of two ways: directly or via programming. The manner of a claw's control must be specified when it is created and cannot be changed thereafter. All of the claws in a particular batch must be controlled in the same manner.",
					"Programmed claws are given a single, brief instruction that they attempt to carry out to the best of their ability. The maximum length of the programming, in words, is 15 plus the level of the creator. This programming sets the conditions under which the claw attack. A sample command might be: Kill anyone except me who opens this chest.",
					"Directly controlled claws are manipulated by the thoughts of their creator. The mental effort of controlling claws is quite tiring and cannot be maintained for more than three consecutive rounds without a one-round rest. Further, the range of such control is limited to 10 feet plus 5 feet per level of the creator. A person controlling claws cannot undertake spellcasting or any other activity. Injury to a controller does not break his control unless unconsciousness results. If direct control is broken for some reason, the claws continue to follow the last orders they were given."

					"DESCRIPTION",
					"The crocodile is a large, dangerous predatory reptile native to tropical and subtropical climes. It spends most of its time submerged in swamps, rivers, or other large bodies of water.",
					"The crocodile is one of the most feared and ugliest predators of the tropics. It has a long, squat body, ranging in size from a scant foot to well over ten feet long. Most mature specimens range from eight to 15 feet long, and some even larger. Many sages argue that crocodiles never stop growing. The crocodile has a long jaw filled with sharp, conical teeth. The powerful maw is superbly adapted for dragging prey beneath the water and dismembering it. Its four short legs are very powerful, and can propel the crocodile rapidly through the water and over the land. Its long tail is also very strong and is sometimes used on land to unbalance its foes.",
					"The crocodile is covered with a tough horny hide, which blends in very well with the surrounding water. Its eyes and nose are placed so that when the crocodile floats, only they remain above water, enabling the beast to spot and ambush prey. The crocodile is adept at floating through the water and remaining quite still, presenting the illusion that it is nothing more than a floating log.",
					"HABITAT / SOCIETY",
					"Crocodiles sometimes congregate in large numbers, but they are not by nature sociable, nor do they cooperate in hunting. They have well-concealed lairs and will often drag their prey to their lairs before eating it. When a tasty morsel comes its way, a group of crocodiles will go into a feeding frenzy, each attempting to get a part of the feast. They hunt almost daily, primarily in the water, rarely on land. Their tastes are broad: fish, men, small mammals, aquatic birds, and even a careless lion has occasionally been known to fall into their grasp. Hungry crocodiles will sometimes upend boats to see what falls out.",
					"Crocodiles mate once a year, and the female lays a clutch of about 60 eggs, carefully burying them in the sand. Unlike many other reptiles, the female carefully guards her eggs, protecting them from other predators. When the time comes for the eggs to hatch, the mother assists by digging the eggs out of the sand. The newly hatched young are thrown entirely on their own resources to survive. Very few of the young survive to maturity.",
					"Swamps and rivers are not the only abode of the crocodile. In recent years there have been dreadful rumors that some of these reptiles have made their homes in the sewers of cities in tropical regions, living on waste and carrion.",
					"ECOLOGY",
					"The crocodile is a formidable predator and has little competition for food from other water creatures. One of the few monsters that can compete with it is the {@creature dragon turtle|AGGMM}. Even on the riverbanks it has little to fear from rival predators; most would prefer not to tangle with a crocodile. The only predator that the crocodile need fear is man, who hunts it for its tough hide, which can be transformed into a beautiful, gleaming leather. Crocodiles are also hunted to eliminate the danger that they represent to riverside communities."

					"The Cyclops were giant; one-eyed monsters; a wild race of lawless creatures who possess neither social manners nor fear of the Gods. Cyclopes means 'round eye.' Considered the sons of {@link Uranus|https://angrygolem-games.com/monster-manual/letter-u/uranus-greek-avatar/} and {@link Gaea|https://angrygolem-games.com/monster-manual/letter-g/gaea-greek-avatar/} they were the workmen of the God {@link Hephaestus|https://angrygolem-games.com/monster-manual/letter-h/haephestus-greek-avatar/} whose workshop was in the heart of the volcanic mountain Etna. According to Homer's Odysseus where he introduced likely the most famous Cyclops, Polyphemus, Cyclopes were the sons of {@link Poseidon|https://angrygolem-games.com/monster-manual/letter-p/poseidon-greek-avatar/}, not Gaea. Homer described the Cyclopes as wild savages, who abstained from agriculture and laws other than every man for himself. They were shepherds who lived in the southwestern part of Sicily, actively ate human beings and lived with their wives and children in caves ruling over them with arbitrary power. The Homeric Cyclopes were not servants of ",
					"{@link Zeus|https://angrygolem-games.com/monster-manual/letter-z/zeus-greek-avatar/}, and in fact, they mostly disregarded him.",
					"Polyphemus was a man-eating monster with a bloody and barbaric story. He fell in love with a beautiful nymph called Galatea who rejected him in favour for a man named Acis. Polyphemus enraged by the rejection, threw Acis and killed him on a massive rock. The blood of Acis formed a stream, which still bears his name today. The Cyclops encounters Odysseus in Homer's tale where he is outwitted and blinded by the hero and turns the wrath of his father, Poseidon on Odysseus. Odysseus arrived on the island of the Cyclops on his way home to Ithica and led his men into a cave full of food unknowing of who the owner was. Polyphemus sealed the cave and the crew within it, eating a few of them. Odysseus managed to trick the Cyclops into getting drunk off of strong wine and told the monster his name was 'No One.' Polyphemus fell asleep, and the hero blinded him with a wooden stake, when the other giants came to help, Polyphemus told him 'No One' had attacked him, and so they left him. Odysseus and his men bound themselves to the bellies of Polyphemus's sheep and escaped when the giant let them out to graze. Odysseus could not help but boast about his victory over his defeated adversary and told Polyphemus his name which in turn led to Poseidon punishing him and causing him to deviate from his route home even more.",

					"A diminutive relative of true giants, cyclopskin are single-eyed giants that live alone or in small bands. The typical cyclopskin weighs around 350 pounds, and stands 7 feet tall. A single large, red eye dominates the center of its forehead.",
					"Shaggy black or dull, deep blue hair falls in a tangled mass about its head and shoulders, its skin tone varies from ruddy brown to muddy yellow, and its voice is rough and sharp. Cyclopskin commonly dress in ragged animal hides and sandals. They smell of equal parts dirt and dung.",
					"HABITAT / SOCIETY",
					"The single-eyed humanoids shy away from organized settlements. If left alone, they tend to leave armed groups alone, though they are not above attacking a much weaker force if they stumble across one. Cyclopskin have no regard for any form of life other than themselves. Captives are either enslaved or eaten. This doesn't happen very often, since the cyclopskin tend to live in remote rocky places.",
					"They rarely wander more than 10 miles from their caves. Being poor hunters, most cyclopskin clans keep small herds of goats or sheep. Some clans are nomadic, while others stay put in their caves. Each spring, regional clans meet to exchange goods and slaves and to select mates. On rare occasions a charismatic cyclopskin will arise and bring together several clans to form a wandering tribe.",
					"The largest known tribe numbered around 80 fighting cyclopskin. Such a band will aggressively raid outlying areas with a boldness uncommon in a single clan. All group decisions are made by the strongest and toughest cyclopskin in the group, usually through intimidation. This in turn leads to brawls and fist fights. There are no rules in such fights, and they can lead to permanent injury or death for the loser.",
					"A cyclopskin cave is sealed with boulders and there is but one entrance. Inside, if size permits, there will be wooden pens to house both animals and slaves. The pens always have roofs of either wooden bars or the natural cave ceiling. At night, a large boulder or stout wooden gate is placed at the entrance of the cave to protect the cyclopskin from predators.",
					"There are no interior fire pits, since cyclopskin use fire infrequently, and then only outside their lairs. Any cyclopskin treasure will be kept in a sack in the cave.",
					"ECOLOGY",
					"Cyclopskin can survive on almost any animal or plant diet. They enjoy meat of all sorts and prize it above vegetable foods. While they live off the land, they do not live with it. They have absolutely no sanitary practices, and rarely even cook their meals. They take no care to preserve their environment while hunting, and are considered to be one of the easiest creatures of their size to track.",
					"The life of a cyclopskin is hazardous, and hence they have a short life expectancy. Besides human adventurers, there are many predators, such as tigers, giants, wyverns, and trolls, that are not above attacking a small group of these giants.",

					"Darklings look much like their distanced Vistani cousins, save that their skin tends to be even darker and they are almost uniformly gaunt. Their features are sunken and worn, making them look as if they had been far too long without nourishment. They dress much like other Vistani, save that they lose their taste for bright colors and tend to wear drab earth tones.",
					"Darklings want as little to do with true Vistani as possible, but often prey on normal men and their societies. They speak the common tongue of men and are generally familiar with a handful (3 to 6) other languages or dialects.",
					"HABITAT / SOCIETY",
					"Having been cast out of the Vistani society for some crime or wrongful act, the darkling often gathers a band of human thugs around him and takes up a life of heinous crime and wandering brutality. While they are unable to cross the misty borders between the domains of Ravenloft, a darkling is said to know every stone and tree in the domain he dwells in. This imprisonment in a single domain is quite painful to a people as full of wanderlust as the Vistani and serves to fuel the evil desire for vengeance that burns in the darkling's heart.",
					"Often, a darkling will work toward some grand scheme which he feels will allow him to escape from the domain he is imprisoned in (or even from Ravenloft itself) and strike back at his former people in some way. Since the Vistani are in far better harmony with the environment than their darkling outcasts, such plans of vengeance are seldom anything but failures.",
					"Darklings often claim to retain more of their fortune telling power than they truly do. Predictions offered by them, however, are either lies or educated guesses.",
					"ECOLOGY",
					"The darkling lives either alone or as the leader of a small band of thugs and ruffians. He looks upon the Vistani as cruel people who have done him wrong and upon normal men as pawns and objects of prey. To the darkling, the world has committed a great wrong and now owes him a great debt. Thus, he looks upon all material things as his rightful property and takes what he needs without regard for the consequences of his actions.",
					"The death of a darkling usually (90%) draws the attention of the nearest Vistani group. Within a week, they arrive at the location of the demise, bury the body (if such is still available), and perform an ancient rite designed to soothe the spirit of their tortured brother and allow him to rest in eternal peace. If this ritual is not completed, there is a 90% chance that the darkling will return in 1d6 weeks as a {@creature ghast|AGGMM} (if the body is intact) or as a {@creature wraith|AGGMM4} (if the body has been destroyed. This undead creature will then hunt down those men who served it in life and kill them, transforming them into {@creature ghoul|AGGMM}s (if the darkling returns as a {@creature ghast|AGGMM}) or {@creature wight|AGGMM4}s (if it is a {@creature wraith|AGGMM4}). Thus, its evil band will again plague the lands."

					"DESCRIPTION",
					"The Death Kiss, or \"bleeder\", is fearsome predator found in caverns or ruins. Its spherical body resembles that of the dreaded {@creature beholder|AGGMM}, but the \"eyestalks\" of this creature are bloodsucking tentacles, its \"eyes\" hook-toothed orifices. They favor a diet of humans and horses, but will attack anything having blood (especially \"easy meals\" like bloodbloated {@creature stirge|AGGMM3}s and lone humans). An older name for these creatures is \"eye of terror\". A gigantic specimen known as The Tentacled One is said to roam the high forests and crags of the northern Sword Coast.",
					"HABITAT / SOCIETY",
					"Bleeders prefer to float above surfaces rather than resting upon them. They move by means of levitation. A death kiss may \"shut itself down\", remaining motionless and insensitive on the ground, and remain alive in that state for long periods of time. To awaken from this hibernation, the creature requires an influx of electrical energy, considerable heat, or the internal shock caused by a blow, fall, wound, or magical attack; any of the above stimulants must deal at least 5 points of damage to the death kiss to wake it from its sleep. Adventurers finding a hibernating death kiss usually provide such stimulation, thinking the sleeper helpless prey. Unless they kill the death kiss before it wakes, all they do is provide the bleeder a meal upon its awakening.",
					"Eyes of terror are solitary hunters, fully inheriting the paranoia and ego of their cousins, the beholders. If they encounter one of their kin, the result is often a mid-air struggle to the death. The loser's body becomes an incubator and breeding ground for the death kiss. offspring. After the victor lays innumerable eggs within the corpse, the eggs suspended within a greenish fluid, 1d4 young \"hatch\" forth within a day. Each new bleeder has half its parent's hit points and size, and fully matures in 1 month. A death kiss's cavern or ruined chamber lair contains the treasure of its victims, often arranged in a trail to attract more prey.",
					"ECOLOGY",
					"Death Kisses prey upon larger creatures, providing a balance against the numbers of magical creatures who have no other natural foes. Death Kisses have little fear of any opponents, save dragons and other beholderkin.",
					"An organ in the upper central body of a death kiss is a valued ingredient in magical potions and spell inks concerned with levitation. Rumors tell of a little-known mage in Marsember who uses the eye of the death kiss to cure blindness, although the process grants only infravision. A brain or nerve node deep in a bleeder's body hardens into a gem-like, soft-sided but faceted red gem. Called \"blood-eyes\", these typically fetch a market price of 70 gp each. They are valued for adornment because they glow more brightly as the wearer's emotions become more intense."

					"DESCRIPTION",
					"Death tyrants are rotting, mold-encrusted beholders. They may be shriveled, wounds exposing their internal, spherical networks of circular ribs, among the remnants of their exoskeletal plates. All sport wounds, some have eyestalks missing, or a milky film covering their eyes. They move and turn more slowly than living beholders, striking and bringing their eyes to bear last in any combat round.",
					"An undead beholder can use all the powers of its surviving eyes, just as it did in life. The powers of 2-5 eyes (select randomly, including the central eye) are lost due to injuries or death, and the change to undeath. Although a death tyrant heals its motive energies through time, it cannot regenerate lost eyestalks or their powers.",
					"Charm powers are lost in undeath. The two eyes that charmed either become useless (60%), or function as weak hold monster effects (40%). A being failing to save against such a hold remains held as long as the eye's gaze remains steadily focused on them. If the eye is turned on another being, or the victim hooded, or forcibly removed, the hold lasts another 1-3 rounds. Death tyrants are immune to sleep, charm, and hold spells.",
					"If not controlled by another creature through magic, a death tyrant hangs motionless until its creator's instructions are fulfilled (for example,Attack all humans who enter this chamber until they are destroyed or flee. Do not leave the chamber.) If no instructions are given to a new death tyrant, it attacks all living things it perceives. Death tyrants occur spontaneously in very rare instances. In most cases, they are created through the magic of evil beings from human mages to illithid villains. Some outcast, magic-using beholders have even been known to create death tyrants from their own unfortunate brethren.",
					"Death tyrants have no self-awareness or social interaction; they are mindless servants of more powerful masters. Mindless is a relative term; the once highly intelligent brains of death tyrants still use eyes skillfully to perceive and attack nearby foes. When a death tyrant is controlled by another being, consider it to have the intelligence of its controller.",
					"Death tyrants are created from dying beholders. A spell, thought to have been developed by human mages in the remote past, forces a beholder from a living to an undead state, and imprints its brain with instructions. Rogue death tyrants also exist: those whose instructions specifically enable them to ignore all controlling attempts. These are immune to the control attempts of all other beings. Beholders often leave them as traps against rivals.",
					"Human spell researchers report that control of a death tyrant is very difficult. A beholder's mind fluctuates wildly in the frequency and level of its mental activity, scrambling normal charm monster and control undead spells. A special spell must be devised to command a death tyrant."

					"DESCRIPTION",
					"Far beneath the surface of the earth dwell the Svirfneblin, or Deep Gnomes. Small parties of these demihumans roam the Underdark's mazes of small passageways searching for gemstones. They are said to dwell in great cities consisting of a closely connected series of tunnels, buildings, and caverns in which up to a thousand of these diminutive creatures live. They keep the location of these hidden cities secret in order to protect them from their deadly foes, the kuo-toa, Drow, and mind flayers.",
					"Svirfneblin are slightly smaller than rock gnomes, but their thin, wiry, gnarled frames are just as strong. Their skin is rock-colored, usually medium brown to brownish gray, and their eyes are gray. Male svirfneblin are completely bald; female deep gnomes have stringy gray hair. The average svirfneblin life span is 250 years.",
					"Svirfneblin mining teams and patrols work together so smoothly that to outside observers they appear to communicate with each other by some form of racial empathy. These small folk can also converse with any creature from the elemental plane of Earth via a curious \"language\" consisting solely of vibrations (each pitch conveys a different message), although only on a very basic level.",
					"HABITAT / SOCIETY",
					"Svirfneblin society is strictly divided between the sexes: females are in charge of food production and running the city, while males patrol its borders and mine for precious stones. A svirfneblin city will have both a king and a queen, each of whom is independent and has his or her own sphere of responsibility. Since only males ever leave the city, the vast majority of encounters will be with deep gnome mining parties seeking for new lodes.",
					"For every four svirfneblin encountered, there will be a 4th level overseer.",
					"Groups of more than 20 will be led by a 6th level burrow warden with two 5th-level assistants.",
					"ECOLOGY",
					"Stealth, cleverness, and tenacity enable the svirfneblin to survive in the extremely hostile environment of the Underdark. They love gems, especially rubies, and will take great risks in order to gain them. Their affinity for stone is such that creatures from the elemental plane of Earth are 90% unlikely to harm a deep gnome, though they might demand a hefty tithe in gems or precious metals for allowing the gnome to escape."

Its tail extends straight out behind it, held aloft by an intricate structure of bony supports, thus allowing its 150 pounds of weight to be carried entirely by the back legs.",

					"DESCRIPTION",
					"The demilich is not, as the name implies, a weaker form of the lich. Rather, it is the stage into which a lich will eventually evolve as the power which has sustained its physical form gradually begins to fail. Inmost cases, all that remains of a demilich's body are a skull, some bones, and a pile of dust.",
					"When it has learned all that it feels it can in its undead life, the lich will continue its quest for power in strange planes unknown to even the wisest of sages. Since it has no use for its physical body at this point, the lich leaves it to decay as it should have done centuries ago.",
					"If the final resting place of a demilich's remains are entered, the dust which was once its body will rise up and assume a man-like shape. In the case of the oldest demiliches (25%), the shape will advance and threaten, but dissipate without attacking in 3 rounds unless attacked. Younger demiliches (75%) still retain a link to their remains, however, and will form with the powers of a wraith. This dust form cannot be turned. In addition, it can store energy from attacks and use this power to engage its foes. If the dust form is attacked, each point of damage which is delivered to it is converted to an energy point. Since the demilich will fall back and seem to suffer injury from each attack (though none is actually inflicted), its attackers are likely to press on in their attempts to destroy it. Once the demilich has acquired 50 energy points, it will assume a manifestation which looks much like the lich's earlier undead form and has the powers and abilities of a ghost, but which cannot be turned.",
					"If anyone touches the skull it will rise into the air and turn to face the most powerful of the intruders (a spell user will be chosen over a non-spell user). Instantly, it unleashes a howl which acts as a death ray, affecting all creatures within a 20' radius of the skull. Those who fail to save vs. death are permanently dead.",
					"On the next round, the demilich will employ another manner of attack. In order to attain the status of a demilich, a lich must have replaced 5-8 (1d4+4) of its teeth with gems. Each of these gems now serves as a powerful magical device which can trap the soul of its adversaries. The physical body of someone hit with the demilich's spell collapses and rots away in a single round. Once it has drained the life essence from the most powerful member of the party, the skull sinks back to the floor. If it continues to be challenged, the demilich can repeat this attack until all of its gems are filled. An amulet of life protection will prevail over the gem, but the character's body will perish regardless.",
					"In addition to the attacks mentioned above, a demilich can also pronounce a powerful curse on those who disturb it. These can be so mighty as to include: always being hit by one's enemies, never making a saving throw, or the inability to acquire new experience points. Demilich curses can be overcome with a remove curse, but the victim loses one point of charisma permanently when the curse is removed.",
					"The skull of a demilich can be affected by spells in only a few ways: a forget spell will cause it to sink down without attacking (either by howling or draining a soul), a dispel evil will do 5-8 (1d4+4) points of damage to it, a shatter spell will inflict 3-18 (3d6) points of damage to it, a holy word pronounced against it will deliver 5-30 (5d6) points of damage, and a power word kill spell cast by an ethereal or astral wizard will cause the skull to shatter (destroying it).",
					"Most weapons will be unable to harm the skull of a demilich, but there are exceptions. A fighter or ranger with a vorpal sword, sword of sharpness, sword +5, or vorpal weapon can inflict normal damage on the skull, as can a paladin with a vorpal or +4 weapon. Further, any character with a +4 or better weapon or a mace of disruption can inflict 1 point of damage to the skull each time he strikes it.",
					"Upon the destruction of the skull, those who have been trapped inside the gems must make a saving throw vs. spell. Those who fail are lost forever, having been consumed by the demilich to power its magical nature. If the character survives, the gem glows with a faint inner light, and true seeing will reveal a tiny figure trapped within. If the throw is made the soul can be freed by simply crushing the gem. A new body must be within 10 yards for the soul to enter or it will be lost. Such a body might be a clone or simulacrum. (See spells of those names.)",
					"If the fragments of the destroyed skull are not destroyed by immersion in holy water and the casting of a dispel magic the demilich will reform in 1-10 days."

					"DESCRIPTION",
					"Derro are a degenerate race of dwarven stature. They have dwelled in the Underdark for ages, but they were discovered by the mind flayers only five centuries ago, and by the drow but shortly before that. The derro have made a name for themselves by their marked cruelty. It is said that a derro lives for two things: the slow and humiliating death of surface demihumans and especially humans, and the perversion of knowledge for their own dark ends.",
					"Derro are short, with skin the color of an ice-covered lake (white, with bluish undertones), sickly pale yellow or tan hair (always straight), and staring, pupil-less eyes. Their features remind dwarves of humans, and vice versa. Derro have rough skin, spotted with short coarse tufts of hair. Most derro wear a loose costume woven from the hair of underground creatures and dyed in deep reds and browns. Even in full armor, exploring new territory or patrolling their own, derro are easily recognizable. Their armor is leather, studded in copper and brass. Leaders, though, wear tougher leather armors, made from the hides of creatures far tougher than cattle. Derro prefer weapons designed to cripple opponents, rather than those built for a quick kill: derro don't see any sport in spears and axes.",
					"HABITAT / SOCIETY",
					"Derro dwell in large underground complexes, nearer the surface than the kuo-toa and drow, but deeper than goblins and trolls. They never expose themselves to direct sunlight, as it nauseates them. Sunlight would kill a derro were he to be exposed to it for a few days. Yet derro occasionally visit the surface world at night, raiding for humans or carrying out a savant's plans.",
					"Derro are never encountered singly. From their combat tactics to their choice of spells, derro demonstrate a mob mentality. A lone demo (the last survivor of an ill-fated patrol, perhaps) is a desperate derro, seeking at all costs to return to his home lair.",
					"A derro lair always has 3d4 + 30 normal derro, plus leaders. The members of the lair are led by the resident savants (1d3 in number) and their apprentices (1d4+1 student savants). Derro unquestioningly obey the puzzling, even suicidal, dictates from their savant leaders.",
					"Should a lair grow very much over 40 inhabitants, half the group (with half the savants and half the leaders) will split off and form an independent community. Such a splinter group will travel quite a distance before settling down, as no two derro lairs have been spotted within several miles of each other. The two groups may communicate for a short time, in order to ensure the new lair's safety, but they soon sever all contacts and act utterly independently of one another. Although it is possible for two lairs to be at war with one another, or to join in combat against a common enemy, no examples of these behaviors have ever been recorded, with the exception of the regular Uniting War, described below.",
					"Also to be found in a derro lair are 5d6+10 human slaves. If any of the lair's savants or students know the {@spell charm person} spell, each slave has a 90% chance of being charmed. Derro hate humans more than any other race; they use humans for the most demeaning manual labor and for breeding.",
					"The derro are said to have a major stronghold somewhere in the Underdark, and there the savants plot and scheme to devastate the surface world and enslave all humanity.",
					"Derro do not appear to worship any powers, but the savants treasure knowledge and the rest of the race pretty much worships the savants. The worst criminals in the derro community, subject to the Polite Execution (which takes a good two weeks, and which roams over miles of subterranean territory), are those who do not follow the laws of the savants.",
					"Most of those laws have to do with the derros' goals: the destruction of humanity and the acquisition of arcane and obscure information. Derro usually scour their territory for magical items, stealing them or, if necessary, purchasing them from more powerful creatures. Derro do not share the love of gold common to their dwarfish relatives, and they have been known to pay exorbitant prices for a few potions or for a magical item with a missing command word.",
					"This serves as one of the bases of trade between derro and other races of the Underdark. Drow find derro to be dangerous opponents (due to the latter's magic resistance) and a race of barbarians with too much interest in the surface world. The mind flayers think the derro taste bad. Duergar disapprove of the derro's love of cruelty. And derro really don't much care about the other races deep beneath the surface. But derro often raid the surface and acquire technology or items that other deep races desire, and so limited trade between a lair and some surrounding creatures is possible.",
					"Every 20 years or so, the derro race mounts an all-out war against other creatures of the Underdark. This is known as the Uniting War, and no savant really expects to win it. The War is a means of winnowing out the weakest of the derro lairs, a focal point for racial identity, and a chance to really start some terror throughout the Underdark. It also serves the purpose of starting rumors. That is, humans will certainly hear that a war is being fought in the Underdark, and will send hundreds of scouting and adventuring parties into the deep underground to investigate. The derro welcome this new source of slaves.",
					"ECOLOGY",
					"Derro can live on a diet of underground fungi, but they find the stuff to be foul-tasting if used as anything other than spices. Thus they seek out other sustenance whenever possible. A derro hunting party usually pursues large, dangerous prey that can feed the entire lair, rather than smaller, simpler food. The derro tendency to torment prey holds true with hunting for food.",
					"The derro also raid other races for food. Sometimes, they merely rob the dwarves or the orcs, hoping to provoke an amusing conflict. But such excursions are tame compared to Open Hunting, the derro term for midnight raids into human settlements. When Open Hunting, a derro party steals cattle and swine, to let loose and hunt at a later time, but it primarily kidnaps humans. As mentioned before, derro treasure humans for slaves and for breeding.",
					"Derro have few other roles in the underground ecosystem. In the last few Uniting Wars, the drow noticed that derro blood (a milky substance that turns brown and rotten upon the slightest exposure to bright light) was a useful ingredient in drow potions."

					"{@link DISPLACER's BEAST TACTICS (read the article)|}",
					"DESCRIPTION",
					"The displacer beast is a magical creature that resembles a {@creature puma|AGGMM3} with two powerful black tentacles growing from its shoulders. Very rare, they stay far from human habitations.",
					"The displacer beast has the blue-black coloring of a dark panther,and a long cat-like body and head. Females range in length from 8 to 9 feet, and weigh 450 pounds; males are 10 to 12 feet long, and weigh up to 500 Lbs. They have 6 legs. Tentacles are tipped with rough horny edges that can inflict terrible wounds. Their eyes glow bright green, even after death.",
					"COMBAT",
					"The displacer beast tries to catch by surprise its victims using its stealth, and then attack using its tentacles to weaken the closest target.",
					"A target trying to get in close combat with the displacer beast is subject to attack of opportunity from the tentacles. The displacer beast can make up to two attacks of opportunity in a round of combat.",
					"If, after the first round of combat none of the targets is down, the displacer beast will withdraw only to come back later and catch the targets again by surprise.",
					"The displacer beast can attempt to disarm an opponent withits tentacles. If it scores a successful hit roll with a -4 penalty, the target is disarmed but suffer no damage. If the hit roll to attempt to disarm the opponent is a natural 20, then the displacer beast grabs the weapon.",
					"The displacer beast is intelligent enough to understand that a disarmed opponent is a vulnerable target. The creature may decide to withdraw with the weapons and return later to finish the victim.",
					"The displacer beast avoids entering close combat with teeth and claws, doing so only if cornered or with no way to escape.",
					"Suggested. The displacement effect can be nullified with a {@spell True Seeing} spell.",
					"HABITAT / SOCIETY",
					"Displacer beasts are carnivores. Unless they are raising young, they usually run in packs, carving a savage swath of destruction as they go. They hate all life, and will sometimes kill purely for pleasure. Fierce and vicious as they are, however, displacer beasts never fight among themselves. The pack is a well-run and highly efficient killing machine. When encountered in packs, displacer beasts are more than a match for many large creatures and have been known to make a meal of {@creature orc|AGGMM3}s, {@creature goblin|AGGMM}s, and bands of men. Any creature entering their territory is viewed as potential prey.",
					"Displacer beasts mate in the autumn, and the young are born in spring. A mated pair of displacer beasts makes its home in a cave, producing litters of 1d4 young. The cubs, about the size of domestic cats, are born without tentacles and reach maturity, though not full size, within 4 months.",
					"They remain in the cave until their displacement abilities are fully developed. This is followed by a two month period during which the cubs are taught how to hunt. When this is completed, the family group disbands and the monsters wander off to join separate packs.",
					"While raising young, the monsters are fiercely protective of their lairs. One adult always remains with the cubs, usually the female, while the other goes off to hunt. Dead prey is dragged back to the lair to be eaten by the family. Lairs are littered with the bones, equipment, and the treasures of its victims.",
					"Naturally vicious and almost evil at times, displacer beasts harbor an undying hatred of blink dogs. Many theories attempt to account for this enmity. Some sages believe it springs from antipathy in temperaments the lawful good blink dog would naturally be the enemy of a creature as savage and destructive as the displacer beast.",
					"Others argue that it is the displacement and blink abilities which cause this antipathy the two abilities, when in close proximity, somehow stimulate the nervous system and produce hostile reactions. Encounters between the two breeds are rare however, since they do not share the same territory.",
					"ECOLOGY",
					"Displacer beasts have little to fear from other large predators, save perhaps trolls or giants. Some wizards and alchemists value their hides for use in certain magical preparations, and will offer generous rewards for them. The eyes of a displacer beast are a highly prized, if uncommon, good luck charms among thieves who believe that they will protect the bearer from detection.",
					"Displacer Beast is employed as material component to empower the following spells: {@spell Illusory Script}, {@spell Silent Image}"

					"DOPPELGANGER's TACTICS (read the article)",
					"DESCRIPTION",
					"The doppelganger is a master of mimicry that survives by taking the shapes of men, demihumans, and humanoids. Doppelgangers are bipedal and generally humanoid in appearance. Their bodies are covered with a thick, hairless gray hide, which gives them a natural AC of 14. They are, however, rarely seen in their true forms.",
					"HABITAT / SOCIETY",
					"Doppelgangers are rumored to be artificial beings that were created long ago by a powerful wizard or godling. They were originally intended to be used as spies and assassins in an ancient, highly magical war. Their creator died long ago, but they live on, still working as spies for evil powers, thieves, and government. They have even been known to work as assassins.",
					"All dopplegangers belong to a single tribe. Although this is rare, groups of doppelgangers can be found anywhere at any time, and in unexpected locations. Working as a unit, they select a group of victims, such as a family or a group of travelers. Basically lazy, doppelgangers find it easier to survive and live comfortably by taking humanoid, and especially human, shape. They prefer to take the form of someone comfortably provided for, and shun assuming the form of hardworking peasants. Since they are only 90% accurate in their mimicry, most doppelgangers are eventually discovered and driven out, and then forced once more to assume a new shape.",
					"Doppelgangers are found most often in their true forms in a dungeon or in the wilderness. Groups often set up a lair in an area well-suited to ambush and surprise, patrolling a regular territory. These bands make a good living by attacking weak humanoid monsters or travelers and stealing their food and treasure. If food and treasure are scarce, they hire out to a powerful wizard or thieves' guild.",
					"A doppelganger who has been hired to replace a specific person will plan its attack with special care, learning as much about the victim and his environment as it can.",
					"The doppelgangers' weaknesses are greed and cowardice. They spend their lives in avid pursuit of gold and other wealth. If attacking a group of adventurers, for example, they often choose the richest-looking one to attack first. If they target a party of adventurers, the doppelgangers wait until the party is on the way out of the dungeon and heading back to town. Since they are cowardly, however, they prefer to take the easiest route toward riches. A doppelganger who chooses a rich adventurer avoids risks once the treasure is safely in hand, and retreats at the earliest opportunity, making some plausible excuse for separating from the human members of the group. They sometimes hire out as spies and assassins for money as well.",
					"ECOLOGY",
					"Doppelgangers are sophisticated and dangerous parasites, living off the labors of others. They must also be reckoned with as clever and effective spies and assassins who can wreak political mayhem in positions of power. Evil wizards have on rare occasions controlled entire kingdoms for short periods of time by replacing a king, prince, or councilor with a doppelganger."

The turtle's rough, deep green shell is much the same color as the deep water the monster favors, and the silver highlights that line the shell are patterned like light dancing on open water.",
					"The turtle's legs and tail are of a lighter green, and they are flecked with golden highlights. The coloration of the creature's head is similar to the legs and tail, but its crest spines are golden with dark green webbing connecting them.",
					"A dragon turtle's shell can reach to 30 feet in diameter, and an adult turtle can measure over 40 feet from its snout to the tip of its tail.",
					"Dragon turtles speak their own highly-developed language.",
					"HABITAT / SOCIETY",
					"Dragon turtles are extremely solitary creatures. Large, desolate sea caves and secret underground caverns that can be accessed only through the water are their favorite lairs. These lairs are difficult to find, but adventurers locating a dragon turtle's cave will find it filled with treasures of all types. The turtle gathers this treasure, which it will protect to the death, from the ships sunk in its territory.",
					"A dragon turtle's territory is well-defined and may cover as much as fifty square miles of open water. Other dragon turtles are allowed into this area only during mating season, though turtles of the same sex will always fight to the death upon meeting. It is this hostility toward their own kind that keeps the number of dragon turtles relatively low.",
					"Mariners of any experience recognize the territorial claims of dragon turtles and will often make extravagant tributes to the turtle controlling areas necessary for safe and speedy trade.",
					"ECOLOGY",
					"Dragon turtles are carnivorous and will eat almost any creature, including humans or other dragon turtles, to satisfy their voracious appetite. Large fish seem to be the prefered food for dragon turtles, and the turtles can often be found lurking in the weeds and muck at the bottom of a lake or sea waiting for fish to pass. In particularly poor years for fish, dragon turtles have been known to use their breath weapon to kill large groups of sea birds that stray too close to the water for food.",
					"Conflict often arises between dragon turtles and the many intelligent aquatic races, like the locathah or mermen, because of competition for ideal lairs. Like many of their land-based relatives, dragon turtles are considered treacherous and selfish by all creatures that share their domain.",
					"Dragon turtle shells make outstanding shields and armor. Because of the shell's strength and natural resistance to the dragon turtle's own breath weapon, armor or a shield made out of this material gains +1 non-magical bonus to armor class."

					"DESCRIPTION",
					"Petty and wicked, dretches are the most common tanar'ri, found in massive hordes everywhere in the Abyss. Along with the manes, the dretches are the rank-and-file of the Blood War.",
					"Dretches are gaunt, squat humanoids with rubbery, almost hairless bodies. Their skin is pale white to beige, giving way to sickly blue in some areas, stretched over pulsing varicose veins. Dretches' mouths are slack and slobbery with many small fangs. Their hair is sparse and bristly, exposing pointed ears that hang limply from either side of the head. A dretch's eyes slant downward and the nose appears squashed.",
					"HABITAT / SOCIETY",
					"Dretches are the lowest form of actual tanar'ri; their inferiors, the manes, are merely dead spirits from the Prime Material Plane. Dretches mill around and torment the manes to avoid considering their own lowly position.",
					"Some dretches try to be extremely useful, hoping for promotion. Others consider themselves so lowly that they have nothing to lose, and they rebel. By virtue of their numbers, they feel they can go their own way and ignore the more powerful tanar'ri. This leads to a huge slaughter of the rebellious dretches by more powerful tanar'ri. These civil outbreaks temporarily divert the tanar'ri from the Blood War, sometimes with disastrous results.",
					"ECOLOGY",
					"Dretches are important to the Blood War. The primary strength of the tanar'ri is their sheer numbers, and those numbers consist largely of dretches. Unlike the hordlings, they are actual tanar'ri and have concern for their position. This makes them more reliable than hordlings, if the term applies to any creature in the Abyss.",
					"The dretches' weakness makes them a perfect choice for food in an environment where food is scarce. Greater fiends eat them in great quantities."

					"The dryad's exquisite features, delicate and finely chiseled, are much like an elf maiden's. Dryads have high cheek bones and amber, violet, or dark green eyes. A dryad's complexion and hair color changes with the seasons, presenting the sprite with natural camouflage. During the fall, a dryad's hair turns golden or red, and her skin subtly darkens from its usual light tan to more closely match her hair color. This enables her to blend with the falling leaves of autumn. In winter, both the dryad's hair and skin are white, like the snows that cover the oak groves.",
					"When encountered in a forest during fall or winter, a dryad is often mistaken for an attractive maid, probably of elvish descent. No one would mistake a dryad for an elf maid during the spring and summer, however. At these times of year, a dryad's skin is lightly tanned and her hair is green like the oak leaves around her.",
					"Dryads often appear clothed in a loose, simple garment. The clothing they wear is the color of the oak grove in the season they appear. They speak their own tongue, as well as the languages of elves, pixies, and sprites. Dryads can also speak with plants.",
					"HABITAT / SOCIETY",
					"Some legends claim that dryads are the animated souls of very old oak trees. Whether this is really the case, it is true that dryads are attached to a single, very large oak tree in their lifetimes and cannot, for any reason, go more than 360 yards from that tree. If a dryad does wander farther away, she becomes weak and dies within 6d6 hours unless returned to her home. The oak trees of dryads do not radiate magic, but someone finding a dryad's home has great power over her. A dryad suffers damage for any damage inflicted upon her home tree. Any attack on a dryad's tree will, of course, bring on a frenzied defense by the dryad.",
					"Although dryads are generally very solitary, up to six have been encountered in one place. This is rare, however. All this really means is that a number of dryad oaks are within 100 yards of one another and the dryads' paths cross. These dryads may come to each other's aid, but never really gather socially. Any treasure owned by a tree sprite is hidden close to her home tree. The gold and gems that make up a dryad's treasure are almost always the gifts of charmed adventurers.",
					"These tree sprites realize that most humans and demihumans fear them for their ability to charm, so dryads only deal with strangers on rare occasions. When approached carefully, however, dryads have been known to aid adventurers. They are a useful source of information, too, as they know a great deal about the area in which they live.",

They do not venture into the surface except at night or on the gloomiest days. Duergar live longer than their surface-dwelling kin. Life spans can reach 400 years or more.",
					"Duergar lairs are always deep underground. These are elaborate collection of chambers, passages, rooms, and secret areas. There is a chance a monster is kept as a guardian for the lair complex. Such a creature is probably kept at an entrance to the duergar complex or kept within the treasure cave.",

					"The duergar are not as affluent as other dwarven races. Individuals may have a few gold or platinum coins stashed away. Normal, usable items like weapons or armor are immediately distributed. Magical items and the bulk of the acquired treasure is stored in a well-protected chamber deep in the duergar complex.",

					"DESCRIPTION",
					"Eagles are majestic birds of prey, rarely used for hunting, but often sought after for their beauty and legendary courage.",
					"Eagles are large birds, usually standing around three feet tall. with distinctive feathering on their legs. Their wing span is an impressive six to seven feet. Eagles are usually brown in color, ranging from the blackish brown of the golden eagle to the dark brown of the bald eagle. They always sport a set of razor-sharp talons and a beak, equally as sharp and turned down abruptly at its point. The eagle's cry is high and shrill.",
					"COMBAT",
					"An eagle typically attacks from great heights, folding back its wings and letting gravity hurtle it toward its prey. If an eagle dives for more than 100 feet, its diving speed is double its normal flying speed and the eagle is restricted to attacking with only its two sets of claws. However, these high-speed attacks gain advantage on hit rolls and score double damage.",
					"HABITAT / SOCIETY",
					"High rocky cliffs and tall, broad trees are the favorite nesting spots for eagles. Once an eagle builds a nest, it will keep that home, adding it with each passing season, until the nest is destroyed or the eagle dies. There is always a 50% chance that 1d4 eggs are present in a nest. If eggs are not present, there is a 20% chance that 1d4 young eagles are present instead. There is always a 10% chance that the eagle is storing some small, shiny objects in the nest (like gold coins or gems).",
					"Eagles are usually encountered alone or in pairs. Eagles mate for life and, since they nest in one spot each year, it is easy to identify places where eagles are normally present. On occasion, in an area of especially rich feeding, 1d8+4 eagles are encountered instead of the normal individual or pair. This fertile area can support more than one nest, so more eagles move into the area.",
					"ECOLOGY",
					"Eagles are carnivores and generally hunt rodents, fish, and other small animals. Eagles have also been known to feed on the carrion of recently killed creatures, as well. Unless exceptionally hungry, an eagle will never attack a humanoid, though small creatures like tiny and small fey have to be wary of a hunting eagle mistaking them for rabbits.",
					"Eagles are not easy to train for hunting purposes. Nevertheless, a thriving market for eaglets and eagle eggs means that each one captured brings a price of 60 to 100 gold. Eagle feathers and other eagle tokens are also valued highly by many adventurers, as they wrongly believe the eagle's courage to be transferred to them by possession of such items."

					"The efreet (singular: efreeti) are genies from the elemental plane of Fire. They are enemies of the djinn and attack them whenever they are encountered. A properly summoned or captured efreeti can be forced to serve for a maximum of 1,001 days, or it can be made to fulfill three wishes.",
					"Efreet are not willing servants and seek to pervert the intent of their masters by adhering to the letter of their commands.",
					"The efreet are said to be made of basalt, bronze, and solid flames. They are massive, solid creatures.",
					"HABITAT / SOCIETY",
					"Efreet are infamous for their hatred of servitude, desire for revenge, cruel nature, and ability to beguile and mislead. The efreet's primary home is their Great Citadel, the fabled City of Brass, but there are many other efreet outposts throughout the plane of Fire.",
					"An efreet outpost is a haven for 4d10 efreet and is run as a military station to watch or harass others in the plane. These outposts are run by a malik or vali of maximum normal hit points. There is a 10% chance that the outpost is also providing a temporary home for {@dice 1d4} {@creature janni|AGGMM2} or {@dice 1d4} {@creature dao|AGGMM} (the only other genies efreet tolerate).",
					"Outpost forces are usually directed against incursions from the Elemental plane of Air, but they can be directed against any travelers deemed suitable for threats, robbery, and abuse. Efreet are lawful, but tend toward organized evil, They are ruled by a grand sultan who makes his home in the City of Brass.",
					"He is advised by a variety of beys, amirs, and maliks concerning actions within the plane, and by six great pashas who deal with efreet business on the Prime Material plane.",
					"The City of Brass is a huge citadel that is home to the majority of efreet. It hovers in the hot regions of the plane and is often bordered by seas of magma and lakes of glowing lava.",
					"The city sits upon a hemisphere of golden, glowing brass some 40 miles across. From the upper towers rise the minarets of the great bastion of the Sultan's Palace. Vast riches are said to be in the palace of the sultan. The city has an efreet population that far outnumbers the great cities of the Prime Material plane.",
					"The sultan wields the might of a Greater Power, while many of his advisors are akin to Lesser Powers and Demi Powers.",
					"ECOLOGY",
					"Fire elementals tend to avoid the efreet, whom they feel are oppressive and opportunistic. Djinn hate them, and there have been numerous direct clashes.",
					"Efreet view most other creatures either as enemies or servants, a view that does not endear them to other genies."

					"DESCRIPTION",
					"Ettercaps are ugly bipedal creatures that get along very well with all types of giant spiders. These creatures of low intelligence are exceedingly cruel, very cunning, and are skilled in setting traps very deadly traps much like the spiders that often live around them.",
					"Ettercaps stand around six feet tall, even with their stooping gait and hunched shoulders. The creatures have short, spindly legs, long arms that reach nearly to their ankles, and large pot-bellies. The hands of ettercaps have a thumb and three long fingers that end in razor sharp claws. Their bodies are covered by tufts of thick, wiry, black hair, and their skin is dark and thick. Ettercaps' heads are almost equine in shape, but they have large reptilian eyes, usually blood-red in color, and large fangs, one protruding downward from each side of the mouth. The mouth itself is large and lined with very sharp teeth.",
					"Ettercaps do not have a formal language. They express themselves through a combination of high-pitched chittering noises, shrieks, and violent actions.",
					"HABITAT / SOCIETY",
					"Ettercaps prefer to dwell in the deepest part of a forest, near paths that are frequented by game or travelers. The creatures' nests are made of a frame of strands filled with rotting leaves and moss. The lairs are often located on the ground, but can also be found up in large, sturdy trees. No treasure is to be found in ettercap lairs, but occasionally items dropped by adventurers who have fallen into ettercap traps are found nearby.",
					"Though usually only one ettercap is encountered at any time, on rare occasions a pair of ettercaps can be found together. The pairs encountered are always mated couples, though the female and male appear to be identical. Ettercap young are abandoned as soon as they are born, so adults are never encountered with young.",
					"ECOLOGY",
					"An ettercap eats any meat, regardless of the type of creature from which it comes. Upon capturing a victim, the ettercap poisons it so it cannot escape; once the creature is dead, the ettercap immediately devours as much of the corpse as possible. Typically, an ettercap can consume an entire deer or a large humanoid in a single sitting. Anything remaining after the ettercap has gorged itself is left for scavengers.",
					"Often (40%), 2d4 spiders of some monstrous type are found cooperating with an ettercap. The ettercap uses any giant spider webs available when it designs its traps. Creatures killed by an ettercap in the web of a giant spider are shared with the spider instead of being devoured entirely by the ettercap.",
					"Ettercap poison is highly valued, partly because of its extreme toxicity and partly because it is rather difficult to obtain. An ettercap's poison glands hold only one ounce of poison at any time, but this ounce is worth up to 1,000 gp on the open market.",
					"Ettercap is employed as material component to empower the following spells: {@spell Poison Spray}"

					"DESCRIPTION",
					"Ettins, or two-headed giants, as they are often called, are vicious and unpredictable hunters that stalk by night and eat any meat they can catch.",
					"An ettin at first appears to be a stone or hill giant with two heads. On closer inspection, however, the creature's vast differences from the relatively civilized giant races become readily apparent. An ettin has pink to brownish skin, though it appears to be covered in a dark brown hide.",
					"This is because an ettin never bathes if it can help it, and is therefore usually encrusted with a thick layer of dirt and grime. Its skin is thick, giving the ettin its low Armor Class. An ettin's hair is long, stringy, and unkempt; its teeth are large, yellowing, and often rotten.",
					"The ettin's facial features strongly resemble those of an orc large watery eyes, turned-up piggish snout, and large mouth. An ettin's right head is always the dominant one, and the right arm and leg will likely appear slightly more muscular and well-developed than the left. An ettin wears only rough, untreated skins, which are dirty and unwashed.",
					"Obviously, ettins smell very bad, due to their complete lack of grooming habits good or bad.",
					"Ettins do not have a true language of their own. Instead, they speak a mish-mash of orc, goblin, giant dialects, and the alignment tongue of chaotic evil creatures. Any adventurer who speaks orcish can understand 50% of what an ettin says.",
					"HABITAT / SOCIETY",
					"Ettins like to establish their lairs in remote, rocky areas. They dwell in dark, underground caves that stink of decaying food and offal. Ettins are generally solitary, and mated pairs only stay together for a few months after a young ettin is born to them.",
					"Young ettins mature very quickly, and within eight to ten months after they are born, they are self-sufficient enough to go off on their own.",
					"On rare occasions, however, a particularly strong ettin may gather a small group of 1d4 ettins together. This small band of ettins stays together only as long as the leader remains alive and undefeated in battle.",
					"Any major defeat shatters the leader's hold over the band, and they each go their separate ways. Ettins collect treasure only because it can buy them the services of goblins or orcs. These creatures sometimes serve ettins by building traps around their lairs, or helping to fight off a powerful opponent.",
					"Ettins have also been known to occasionally keep cave bears in the area of their lairs. The sloppy caves of ettins are a haven for parasites and vermin, and it isn't unusual for the ettins themselves to be infected with various parasitic diseases. Adventurers rummaging through ettin lairs for valuables will find the task disgusting, if not dangerous.",
					"ECOLOGY",
					"Because ettin society is so primitive, they produce little of any value to civilized creatures. Ettins tolerate the presence of other creatures, like orcs, in the area of their lair if they can be useful in some way. Otherwise, ettins tend to be violently isolationist, crushing trespassers without question."

					"Fire elementals can be conjured in any area containing a large open flame. To provide a fire elemental with an adequate shell of Prime Material flame, a fire built to house an elemental should have a diameter of at least six feet and reach a minimum of four feet into the air.",
					"On the Prime Material plane, a fire elemental appears as a tall sheet of flame. The fire elemental will always appear to have two armlike appendages, one on each side of its body These arms seem to flicker back into the creature's flaming body, only to spring out from its sides seconds later.",
					"The only facial features of a fire elemental are two large glowing patches of brilliant blue fire, which seem to function as eyes for the elemental. Like all common elementals, fire elementals rarely speak on the Prime Material plane, though their voices can be heard in the crackle and hiss of a large fire.",
					"Fire Elemental is employed as material component to empower the following spells: {@spell Burning Hands}, {@spell Find Familiar}, {@spell Fire Bolt}, {@spell Hail of Thorns}, {@spell Magic Missile}, {@spell Produce Flame}"

Fire giants have coal black skin, flaming red or bright orange hair, and prognathous jaws that reveal dirty ivory or yellow teeth. They can live to be 350 years old.",
					"They carry their belongings in huge sacks. A typical fire giant's sack contains {@dice 1d4+1} throwing rocks, the giant's wealth, a tinderbox, and {@dice 3d4} common items. Everything they own is battered, filthy, and smelly, making it difficult to identify valuable items.",
					"HABITAT / SOCIETY",
					"Fire giants live in well organized military groups, occupying large castles or caverns. When encountered in their lair there will be {@dice 1d8+12} giants, half of whom will be immature giants. To determine a giant's maturity, roll {@dice 1d4}. A roll of 4 indicates an infant with no combat ability and the hit points of an ogre while rolls of 1-3 indicate older progeny with Hit Dice, damage, and attack rolls reduced by 1, 2 or 3, respectively.",
					"Their lairs are always protected by vigilant watchmen, and sometimes by traps. Fire giants favor deadfalls that can crush intruders {@dice 5d6} bludgenoning damage, and large crossbow devices that fire one, two, or three huge bolts for {@dice 2d8} piercing damage each.",
					"Particularly intelligent fire giant leaders will command groups three or four times normal size. One who commands 30 or more giants usually will call himself a king. Kings always will have better than normal armor and a magical weapon of +1 to +3.",
					"There is a 20% chance that any band of fire giants will have a shaman (80%) or witch doctor (20%). If the group is lead by a king, there is an 80% chance of a spell caster.",
					"Fire giant shamans are priests of up to 7th level. Fire giant witch doctors are priest/wizards of up to 7th; they prefer spells that can detect or thwart intruders.",
					"Fire giants often capture and tame other creatures as guards. There is a 50% chance that a fire giant lair will contain {@dice 1d4} {@creature hell hound|AGGMM2}s. Larger than normal groups check once for every 10 giants.",
					"Bands with 30 or more giants have a additional 30% chance to have {@dice 1d4+1} {@creature troll|AGGMM4}s, larger groups check once for every 20 giants.",
					"A king's group has a 20% chance to have {@dice 1d2} red young dragons in addition to other guards. Fire giants frequently take captives to hold for ransom or use as slaves. There is a 25% chance that a lair will contain {@dice 1d2} captives, larger bands check once per 10 giants.",
					"ECOLOGY",
					"Fire giants live wherever there is a lot of heat. They prefer volcanic regions or areas with hot springs. Frequently they share their lairs with other fire-dwelling creatures such as {@creature fire salamander|AGGMM3}s or {@creature fire elemental|AGGMM}s.",
					"Fire giants prefer to eat meat and bread, they can hunt and kill their own meat, but raid humanoid settlements for grain, captives, and treasure."

					"DESCRIPTION",
					"Flumph resemble aerial jellyfish. These odd creatures are round and almost flat, perhaps the or four inches thick in the center, tapering to one or two inches near the edge. The body is mostly hollow, much like a large cushion. A round orifices is in the center of the upper surface, flanked by two eyestalks, each about six inches long. Several short tentacles hang from the creature's underside, concealing a mass of small spikes. The tentacles closest to the flumph's rim can be used for fine manipulation of small objects. A common flumph is pure white in color; a monastic flumph is generally a pale yellow or green, with darker tentacles.",
					"A flumph flies by taking in air through the hole on its upper surface, and expelling it through several small holes on its underside. The creature also has several small apertures along its equator, for use in maneuvering. It usually hovers about four to six inches above the ground. Keeping its body aloft does not require great amounts of air. It creates a gentle breeze, and a slight whistling sound can be heard in a quiet area.",
					"Common flumphs cannot communicate vocally, but have a unique sign language that makes use of their tentacles and eyestalks. Some monastic flumphs, perhaps 10%, can speak and understand common or another language.",
					"COMBAT",
					"The flumph survives by hunting small creatures, such as rats, lizards, frogs, and the like. The flumph hovers along just above the ground, or hangs motionless in reeds or similar concealment. When it finds a small creature, it rises a foot or two, then drops onto its prey, its spikes inflicting 1d4 +2 points of piercing damage on a successful attack.",
					"In addition, the flumphs tentacles secrete digestive acids into the wounds; the acid causes an additional 1d4 points of acid damage each round. Once the prey is dead, the flumph settles on it and absorbs nutrients through its tentacles. Flumphs often need to pursue their healthier prey for a short distance before the victim dies. The acid can be washed away by complete immersion in a fast-moving stream, by actively washing the acid away (full round action) with a {@spell Create Food and Water|PHB|Create Water} spell (simple immersion or rinsing will not work) or by a {@spell Lesser Restoration} cast on the target.",
					"If threatened by a larger creature, the flumph usually attempts to drive it away by squirting a foul-smelling liquid from an orifice on its equator, in the front. If this method of repulsion fails, the flumph can rise to a height of 10 feet and drop onto an opponent, as if hunting.",
					"HABITAT / SOCIETY",
					"The common flumph is a nomadic hunter, intelligent, good-aligned, and peaceful. A flumph reproduces about every two years by budding, producing 1d8 tiny flumphs on its underside. These become independent after about three months when they reach two inches in diameter. They grow to adult size within a month, and live for 20 years.",
					"ECOLOGY",
					"Flumphs are predators low on the food chain, feeding on smaller creatures and clearing their area of vermin. Flumph flesh has a foul taste, and they are generally considered unpalatable, though ogres and some goblinoids will eat them.",
					"Monastic Flumphs",
					"The seldom-seen monastic flumphs are more advanced creatures that can cast spells as if they were clerics of levels equal to their Hit Dice. They gather in cloisters to share knowledge and to worship deities unknown to humanoids. A cloister is usually in a large cavern or (in swamps and grasslands) a large, nest-like bower constructed of grass and mud. The inside of a cloister is decorated with fine, colorful paintings, made by flumphs dabbing natural pigments with their tentacles. The paintings are usually abstract, showing spirals and other curved lines, though some are vaguely representational of flumphs engaged in hunting.",
					"Each cloister is led by an {@creature abbot flumph|AGGMM}.",
					"The abbot is aided by one {@creature prior flumph} per six flumphs in the cloister.",
					"The remainder of the flumphs are {@creature monk flumph|AGGMM}.",
					"On occasion, a small group of common flumphs can be found near a cloister, bringing food as an offering in return for healing or guidance."

In the hot lands, tales abound of lizardfolk and yuan-ti who train flying snakes to hunt for them, or learn to work with the snakes as partners.",

					"Flying snakes may be of any color or appearance. Most have flat, pointed, viper-like heads, red or yellow eyes, and emerald-green or bronze scales.",
					"COMBAT",
					"Flying snakes bite and slash with their needle-sharp fangs, or spit acid at opponents up to 10 feet away. An acid spit does 1d4 acid damage to tissue, hide or cloth, but does not affect metal or stone.",
					"Flying fangs always strike at the faces of their foes, seeking to blind beings so they can be slain and devoured at the fangs' leisure. The snakes will attack any living creature they feel they can slay and eat.",
					"Against small sized or smaller creatures, a flying snake can grasp and encoil its victim. This does no damage, but lowers the victim's speed to 5 feet and remove the dexterity bonus on armor class. To wrap its coils around an opponent, a flying snake must make a successful attack roll. Allow one attempt once every other round of combat as an extra attack roll.",
					"ECOLOGY",
					"A single flying snake eats five times its weight in a day, if it can get that much. Hunting flights often slay a dozen man-sized victims or more if they judge that other predators will leave the bodies undisturbed, for later meals."

					"A partial list of deformations includes misplaced limb, misshapen limb, misplaced facial feature, hunchbacked, bulging body part, drooping flesh, body part too big or too small, flapping ears, huge snout, large feet on short legs.",
					"Their thick, hairy hides, combined with the pelts and odd metal bits they wear for protection. They have scattered patches of hair as tough as wire on their pale white skin. Large warts and other growths are scattered across their bodies.",
					"There is no single odor associated with fomorians; some smell strongly due to overactive sweat glands, others have no smell. Their voices are also each different due to their unique deformities.",
					"HABITAT / SOCIETY",
					"Fomorians live in mountain caves, abandoned mines, or other subterranean realms. They rarely modify their homes, but adapt to what is already there.",
					"These deformed giants wander throughout the underground complex, for almost any distance, stopped only by hazards they do not want to challenge.",
					"A fomorian clan picks a small, (to them) defensible alcove for a lair. Their territories are sometimes marked by the bodies of their enemies.",
					"Their treasure consists only of stolen items from enemies. Pieces of armor are added to their own patchwork protection.",
					"Since they do not care for it, this armor quickly deteriorates and becomes worthless.",
					"Their society is ruled by depravity and wickedness. The strongest and cruelest giant rules over all the others within reach, which is usually a small number.",
					"The women and children are treated as slaves. Acts of violence are common among fomorians, sometimes resulting in permanent injury or death.",
					"Fomorian giants have been known to work with other creatures for evil causes. Usually the other creatures must completely dominate the fomorians, or be capable of it, to form the alliance.",
					"Such an agreement lasts only as long as the fomorians fear their cohorts. Once their interests no longer coincide or the fomorians no longer feel threatened, they double-cross their partners, as quickly as possible.",
					"ECOLOGY",
					"These twisted giants can live for weeks on little or no food. This is good, because their underground dwellings do not provide an abundance of it.",
					"They can eat almost any organic material, including fungi, lichens, plants of all sorts, bats, mice and fish. They particularly savor the taste of large mammals, especially those that beg not to be eaten.",
					"Preparing a meal usually involves torture rather than any efforts to improve its taste."

					"DESCRIPTION",
					"This giant amphibian horror lurks in the darkest swamps and dankest subterranean pools. The froghemoth's 18-foot-long, 10-foot-wide body is yellow on the belly, shading to a light green on its sides and a mottled green on its back and thick, bowed rear legs. Two tentacles sprout from each shoulder. The tentacles are 15 feet or more long, green on top and yellowish underneath. The creature's nostrils are stalk-like, and its three eyes are housed on a protruding, retractable appendage that can be withdrawn. Its eyes are amber with a green tinge and have vertical slit pupils of bright green edged with orange.",
					"When it is submerged, its tentacles trailing ashore and its eye and nostril stalks at water level, it appears to be nothing more than a plant growth of some sort.",
					"HABITAT / SOCIETY",
					"A froghemoth lives only in large swamps or in shallow fresh water (100 feet or less). It can operate on dry land, but it moves in a series of awkward hops at half speed.",
					"Once every nine years, froghemoths retum to their spawning ground to mate with others of their ilk. Every pair lays 10 to 100 eggs, each about a foot long, in shallow water. The tadpoles are immediately left to fend for themselves.",
					"Immature froghemoths (tadhemoths) resemble fish (2 HD; AC 16) with four pectoral fins (which will turn into tentacles) and two tails (which will turn into legs). For 6 months, the creatures grows about a foot per month, then gains about a foot every 2 months until it reaches full size. At 6 months, the tentacles start to develop. By the 10th month the legs start to develop, and by the 12th month the tadhemoth stage has ended. Tadhemoths eat and are eaten by each other, only 10% survive more than a few days after hatching, and only 1% to 4% reach adult size. Barring violent death, froghemoths are thought to live up to 100 years.",
					"ECOLOGY",
					"The froghemoth is very likely the dominant predator in its home region. Only very powerful creatures (like dragons or well-equipped adventurers) can hope to succeed against one. Froghemoth tadpoles cannot be trained, but it may be possible to capture one and move it someplace where it can act as a vicious and somewhat unreliable guard animal."

					"Sitting together in groups, the galeb duhr harmonize their gravelly voices into eldritch tunes; some sages speculate that these melodies can cause or prevent earthquakes. Others argue that the low rumbling produced by these creatures is a form of warning to others in the group, but there is no conclusive evidence either way.",
					"ECOLOGY",

The rocks they eat become part of the huge creatures; such a meal need take place only once every two or three months.",
					"Besides the gems that they carry with them, galeb duhr are likely to know where many other gems are, as well as veins of precious metals, such as gold, silver, and platinum, though galeb duhr seem to have no interest in these minerals for themselves. A few powerful mages have been able to bargain with the galeb duhr for this information. This is a difficult agreement to consummate, for the galeb duhr are valiant fighters, and usually have no difficulty in escaping from any harm if they are inclined to do so. Further, the galeb duhr are territorial, and would be irritated at any attempt to make use of this knowledge in their vicinity.",
					"In some strange way, galeb duhr feel responsible for the smaller rocks and boulders around them, in much the same way that a treant feels responsible for trees in its neighborhood. A traveler who disturbs the area near a galeb duhr does so at his own peril.",

					"The damage they do to other creatures is not for sustenance, but only for their distorted sense of pleasure. Because they are fairly intelligent and evil, they will sometimes serve an evil master of some sort. In this case, the gargoyles usually act as guards or messengers; besides some gold or a few gems. their unsavory payment is the enjoyment they get from attacking unwanted visitors.",

					"DESCRIPTION",
					"The Gauth is a relative of the beholder that feeds on magic. Its spherical body is 5 feet in diameter and brown in color, mottled with purple and gray. Located in the center of the gauth's forward hemisphere is a large central eye surrounded by a ring of smaller eyes that are protected by ridges of tough flesh. These secondary body eyes provide the creature with normal vision in lighted areas and infravision to 90 feet. On the underside is the beast's fearsome mouth with its accompanying cluster of four feeding tendrils, while the top is adorned with a crown of six eye stalks.",
					"While the gauth is similar to the beholder, its ability to feed on the energy of magical objects makes it even more dangerous in some ways.",
					"When a gauth moves into combat, it begins to glow, much as if it were the object of a faerie fire spell, to attract the attention of its foes. A creature that meets the gaze of the central eye must roll a successful saving throw vs. spell, with a -2 penalty, or be affected as if the victim of a feeblemind spell.",
					"If a gauth chooses to bite with its great maw, the sharp fangs inflict {@dice 3d4} points of damage. The four tendrils around the mouth can grab and hold victims as if they had a Strength of 18, but they can inflict no damage.",
					"A gauth in combat can also employ its six eye stalks.",
					"Perhaps the most feared of the gauth's powers, its dweomer drain, permits the gauth to drain charges from magical items. It has a 40-foot range and can be targeted on one individual per round. In addition to preventing one object from functioning for the duration of that round, this power drains one charge from one charged object. Permanent objects, such as magical swords, are rendered powerless for one round by this ability. Artifacts are not affected by the dweomer drain. The eye has no effect on spells that have been memorized (but not yet cast) and it will not break the concentration of a wizard. It does neutralize any spell cast by its target that round, however.",
					"A {@spell dispel magic} spell cast on any of the gauth's eye stalks prevents its use for {@dice 1d4} rounds. The central eye, any fully retracted eye stalks, the body's ability to glow, and the gauth's natural levitation are not subject to injury by such a spell.",
					"If a gauth is slain, its magical energy dissipates. Usually, this is a harmless event, but there is a 2% chance that it is catastrophic, inflicting {@dice 4d4} points of damage to all creatures within 10 feet (no saving throw). Gauth are immune to their own powers and to those of other gauth. They have an unusual physiology that enables them to regenerate 1 hit point every two turns.",
					"Although gauth are not known to fight over territories or prey, they do go to great lengths to avoid each other. Even when they encounter another of their kind in the wilderness, they often ignore them utterly.",
					"A gauth can survive by eating meat but it greatly prefers to devour magical objects. In some unknown manner, the creature is able to absorb magical energy and feed on it. Each turn that an object spends in the gauth's stomach causes it to lose one charge. A permanent object is rendered inoperative after one day (artifacts are not affected, nor do they provide sustenance). Magical objects that cannot be entirely digested by a gauth are spat out after they have been drained of all their power.",
					"Gauth are thought to live a century or so. Within a week of their natural death, two young gauth emerge from the corpse. Although smaller than their parent (each has 2 or 3 HD and a bite that causes only {@dice 2d4} points of damage), they have all the powers of a full-grown adult."

					"DESCRIPTION",
					"Ghosts are the spirits of humans who were either so greatly evil in life or whose deaths were so unusually emotional they have been cursed with the gift of undead status. Thus, they roam about at night or in places of darkness. These spirits hate goodness and life, hungering to draw the living essences from the living.",
					"HABITAT / SOCIETY",
					"In most cases, a ghost is confined to a small physical area, which the ghost haunts. Those who have heard stories of a haunted area can thus attempt to avoid it for their own safety.",
					"A ghost often has a specific purpose in its haunting, sometimes trying to \"get even\" for something that happened during the ghost's life. Thus a woman who was jilted by a lover, and then committed suicide, might become a ghost and haunt the couple's secret trysting place. Similarly, a man who failed at business might appear each night at his storefront or, perhaps, at that of a former competitor.",
					"Another common reason for an individual to become a ghost is the denial of a proper burial. A ghost might inhabit the area near its body, waiting for a passerby to promise to bury the remains. The ghost, in its resentment toward all life, becomes an evil creature intent on destruction and suffering.",
					"In rare circumstances, more than one ghost will haunt the same location. The classic example of this is the haunted ship, a vessel lost at sea, now ethereal and crewed entirely by ghosts. These ships are most often encountered in the presence of St. Elmo's fire, an electrical discharge that causes mysterious lights to appear in the rigging of a ship.",
					"In many cases, a ghost can be overcome by those who might be no match for it in combat simply by setting right whatever events led to the attainment of the ghost's undead status. For example, a young woman who was betrayed and murdered by someone who pretended to love her might be freed from her curse if the cad were humiliated and ruined. In many cases, however, a ghost's revenge will be far more demanding, often ending in the death of the offender.",
					"ECOLOGY",
					"The dreadful fear caused by the ghost, which ages a victim 10 years, is not well understood by the common man, who often ascribes it to the fact that a ghost is \"dead\". If this were the case, then certainly skeletons and zombies would have the same effect, which they do not.",
					"Common folklore further confuses this fact by relating details of the ghost's physical form: the classic example of which is the headless horseman, thought by many to be particularly frightening simply because he had no head. Under this belief, one could face a ghost if only one had the courage to stand up to him. Such a mistaken impression has cost many lives over the years. Actually, the fear is caused by the supernatural power of the ghost, and has nothing whatsoever to do with courage."

					"DESCRIPTION",
					"Giant centipedes are crawling arthropods that arouse almost universal disgust from all intelligent creatures (even other monsters). They are endemic to most regions.",
					"One of the things that makes the centipede so repulsive is its resemblance to the worm. Its long body is divided into many segments from which protrude many tiny feet. Hence the name \"centipede\" (or hundred-footed). The giant centipede is so named because it is over 1-foot long. The body is plated with a chitinous shell and it moves with a slight undulating motion. The creature has the added benefit of protective coloration, and varies in color depending on the terrain it inhabits. Those that favor rocky areas are gray, those that live underground are black, while centipedes of the forest are brown or red.",
					"COMBAT",
					"When hunting, centipedes use their natural coloration to remain unseen until they can drop on their prey from above or crawl out of hiding in pursuit of food. They attack by biting their foes and injecting a paralytic poison.",
					"Although a single giant centipede rarely constitutes a serious threat to a man, these creatures frequently travel in groups. When more than one centipede is encountered, the monsters will fight independently, even to the point of fighting among themselves over fallen victims.",
					"HABITAT / SOCIETY",
					"The centipede behaves like most other insects, roving from place to place in search of food; it has no set territory or dwelling. The centipede simply goes where its hunger leads it. It is an aggressive and hungry carnivore that must eat at least once a day to survive. Hungry centipedes often resort to cannibalism.",
					"ECOLOGY",
					"Giant centipedes have several natural advantages, including poison and protective coloration, allowing them to compete with other small predators for game. Their poison bestows a certain immunity from being hunted, but hungry and skilled animals such as coyotes and large predatory birds hunt them effectively in lean times.",
					"Their preferred targets are small mammals that are easily overcome by their weak poison. If they are very hungry, however, they have been known to attack anything that moves, including humans."

There is a 50% chance that 1d4 eggs are present in a nest, or a 25% chance of 1d4 young. If there are young or eggs in the nest, the giant eagle will attack any creature within 50 feet of the nest. Eagles are always suspicious of any creature coming near a nest, whether eaglets are present or not, as this is where their treasure is to be found.",

Fortunately, the wings of a giant beetle cannot be used to fly, and in most cases, its six bristly legs do not enable it to move as fast as a fleeing man. The hard, chitinous shell of several varieties of these beetles are brightly colored, and sometimes have value to art collectors. While their shells protect beetles as well as plate mail armor, it is difficult to craft armor from them, and a skilled alchemist would need to be brought in on the job.",
					"All beetles are basically unintelligent and always hungry. They will feed on virtually any form of organic material, including other sorts of beetles. They taste matter with their antennae, or feelers; if a substance tasted is organic, the beetle grasps it with its mandibles, crushes it, and eats it. Because of the thorough grinding of the mandibles, nothing eaten by giant beetles can be revived by anything short of a wish. Beetles do not hear or see well, and rely primarily on taste and feel.",

					"The light from these glands is cold it produces no heat. Many mages and alchemists are eager to discover the secret of this cold light, which could be not only safe, but economical, with no parts to heat up and burn out. In theory, they say, such a light source could last forever.",

If the hyaenodon does this, the victim's speed is cut by 15 feet for each hyaenodon that attaches itself. Hyaenodon packs will devour one medium-sized victim per day. Because of their larger size, they are able to take large prey such as {@creature elephant|AGGMM}s, oxen. and buffalo. If a {@creature giant hyena|AGGMM2} suffers 5 or more points of burning damage, it immediately flees the area in search of a spot to tend its wounds."

					"DESCRIPTION",
					"The dreaded \"cuttlefish\" are the scourge of ocean-going sailors and fishermen. Malicious and cunning, giant octopi have been known to attack ships, sinking smaller craft and stealing crew members from the larger ships.",
					"Giant octopi change their color to blend into their surroundings, and the range of colors and patterns available to them is extensive, from green to deep black, blue speckles and red stripes. Tentacles are often disguised as seaweed. Normal coloration is grey to brown, and their vicious beaks are a deep yellow with a bright orange mouth and tongue.",
					"COMBAT",
					"An octopus will readily attack swimmers or small vessels in order to eat the crew. Several have been known to cooperate in order to overwhelm a larger ship, and any craft seized by these monsters loses way and comes to a full stop in three turns.",
					"A giant octopus generally attacks with six of its eight tentacles, using two to anchor itself. Each striking tentacle causes {@dice 2d6+3} points of damage, but unless the member is loosened or severed, it constricts for {@dice 2d4+3} bludgeoning damage every round after striking. If a victim is dragged close enough to the beak, the monster can bite for {@dice 2d8+3} piercing damage. Any large target can be struck by only one tentacle at a time.",
					"A tentacle can be severed by inflicting 8 points of damage. (These hit points are in addition to the base octopus' hit points).",
					"Once three or more tentacles are severed, it is 90% probable that the octopus will retreat, ejecting a cloud of black ink 60 feet high by 60 feet wide by 60 feet long. This ink cloud completely obscures the vision of any creature within it. The wounded octopus then camouflages itself in its lair or a nearby hiding place. It takes the monster two to three months to grow back severed tentacles.",
					"HABITAT / SOCIETY",
					"While octopi cooperate to attack a food source, they live a solitary existence, preferring to shelter in warm water of medial to shallow depth. Lairs are made in wrecked ships and undersea caves; any treasure found there is just an incidental leftover from previous meals. Consummate hunters, these monsters have great patience and cover a very small area, waiting for their food to come to them. Mating season comes every spring. Like most marine animals, octopi leave their eggs in a reef to fend for themselves.",
					"ECOLOGY",
					"When prey is scarce, or if it has been wounded, an octopus turns to scavenging, eating everything from small crustaceans to seaweeds. Survival is paramount with this monster. It prefers to hunt at night, and often a man missing during the late night watch has been grabbed by a giant octopus, pulled quickly over the side, and eaten.",
					"Giant octopi's leathery hide is tough and waterproof, and it is worked into fine rain ponchos by sailors lucky enough to catch and kill one. Another by-product of these monsters is their ink they are most often hunted for this commodity. Giant octopus ink can be used to pen magical scrolls."

					"DESCRIPTION",
					"Giant scorpions are vicious predators that live almost anywhere, including relatively cold places such as dungeons, though they favor deserts and warm lands. These creatures are giant versions of the normal 4-inch-long scorpion found in desert climes.",
					"The giant scorpion has a green carapace and yellowish green legs and pincers. The segmented tail is black, with a vicious stinger on the end. There is a bitter smell associated with the scorpion, which probably comes from the venom. They make an unnerving scrabbling sound as they travel across dungeon floors.",
					"HABITAT / SOCIETY",
					"Giant scorpions live in underground burrows or dungeons. Each lair may (20%) have {@dice 5d4} scorpion eggs. These beasts eat any living creature that is unfortunate enough to stray too close to their lair.",
					"Any treasure found comes from the bodies of human or demihuman victims that have been dragged here to be consumed. Armor is rarely found intact, since the scorpion will surely have used its pincers to cut up its prey.",
					"ECOLOGY",
					"These bizarre insects contribute to the ecosystem by feeding on other giant versions of insects such as spiders and ants. They themselves are prey for purple worms and other huge, subterranean creatures. Alchemists and assassins prize the scorpion's venom because of its potency."

					"DESCRIPTION",
					"Giant sea horses are simply a huge species of the more common sea horse. They have the characteristic horse-like heads and tapering tails of all sea horses.",
					"COMBAT",
					"A sea horse can normally attack only with a head butt, but a sea horse trained by locathah or aquatic elves as a steed can also use its long, curling tail to constrict and restrain enemies. The sea horse must be ridden in order to properly obey the command to constrict and then must make a successful attack roll. A captured opponent can free itself with a successful DC 13 Athletic check.",
					"The tail of a giant sea horse is so long that it can attack the same opponent that the head butts, or the one its rider is attacking, without penalty. The length of the tail also constricts the entire body of any medium or smaller creature, making spellcasting or melee fighting impossible for constricted creatures. The constriction causes no damage, but the sea horse can still choose to butt the helpless victim if so desired.",
					"Note that underwater combat is three-dimensional and sea horses instinctively use this advantage against creatures that are obviously out of their environment, like most humanoids. Sea horse riders take great pains to develop this instinct in their mounts and take advantage of their sea horses' ability to move vertically as well as forward and back and from side to side.",
					"All sea horses have 120-foot darkvision and acute senses; it is a foolish rider who fails to take notice of his sea horse mount's warnings.",
					"HABITAT / SOCIETY",
					"In their natural environment, sea horses congregate in schools, feeding off small plankton and seaweed. They have school leaders and follow the prevailing currents. They are generally shy and avoid contact except with other sea horses.",
					"Sea horses can be found in any marine setting except the coldest arctic depths. They prefer tropical to subtropical depths as these provide the greatest variety of foods.",
					"Sea horses are not the brightest of beasts and can be lured into traps and cages if the bait is attractive enough. Aquatic elves and locathah have honed the activity of capturing sea horses to a fine art and acquire all the sea horses they need.",
					"ECOLOGY",
					"Sea horses are preyed upon by the usual assortment of ocean-based predators, namely sharks, giant squids, and krakens. They only have one special predator, the vicious sahuagin. Unfortunately for sea horses, sahuagin will eat anything at least once and they found that giant sea horses were indeed a great delicacy. A small and profitable industry in every sahuagin city is the market guild, and the greatest commodity is sea horse flesh. Many noble houses specialize in hunting down and herding up these peaceful creatures. Sahuagin choose not to cultivate sea horses as they believe the open ocean makes the horses tougher and tastier.",
					"Fortunately for the species, sea horses mate all the time and like most fish they grow very rapidly. There is little chance of sending the sea horse population to extinction. For now at least, they remain one of the larger members of the food chain and valued for defense and prestige in both the locathah and aquatic elven communities.",
					"Rumors of a smaller, freshwater species of giant sea horse remain unconfirmed and the tales of gargantuan sea horses over 60 feet in length have been decisively discounted by most reputable marine authorities. However, only the races that live below the sea can say for certain what mysteries yet remain to someday be discovered by men."

A creature trapped within a megalodon can attack the beast from within with disadvantage and inflicts minimum damage. The victim must take the shark to 0 points or less before the shark's digestive juices finish their work.",

Few fishermen argue the point."

					"DESCRIPTION",
					"These large, featherless, flightless birds are used as mounts by firenewts. The giant strider is about the size of an ostrich. It has a bumpy, dusky red hide and dully-glowing red eyes. It is often mistaken for a lizard.",
					"HABITAT / SOCIETY",
					"Giant striders are completely adapted to life in hot, volcanic regions. Their meager diet consists of the few animals and plants that share their hot realm. They are able to directly metabolize the heat of their surroundings, and they use this to fuel their own bodily functions. Without this extra heat, the giant strider grows chilled and sluggish.",
					"Their physiology is so modified that normal conditions are dangerous to them. They are poisoned by ingested water and harmed by cold weather or frigid attacks.",
					"Despite their abnormal natue, giant striders' behavior is similar to that of other flightless birds. Mating season occurs in the spring. Cocks compete for mates by elaborate dances punctuated by the explosions of fireballs. The hens lay {@dice 1d4} eggs in a simple nest, usually a pit scratched in the ground. The chicks hatch in five to six weeks and stand about 6 inches high. They grow swiftly, adding 6 inches per month. They can begin to emit flame after six months. Giant striders mature in one year.",
					"Giant striders are the primary mounts of firenewts. A firenewt tribe might keep a herd of up to 100 giant striders. Giant striders are fitted with a saddle atop the hips. The firenewts control these mounts by kicking their sides or hitting them with spears (the giant striders' sharp teeth would saw through any bridle).",
					"ECOLOGY",
					"Wild striders have a potential lifespan of 10 to 20 years, although the struggle for survival usually shortens this. Striders domesticated by firenewts are usually killed and eaten after 15 years."

					"DESCRIPTION",
					"Giant weasels are giant-sized versions of this species that, although similar in many respects to normal weasels, are much more vicious and aggressive. Perhaps the most obvious difference is their tendency to live and hunt in packs. They attack men as often as any other prey and are relentless adversaries.",
					"When a giant weasel bites, it locks its jaws onto its victim and refuses to let go. Instead, the weasel begins to suck the blood from its prey. Agents in the animal's saliva not only prevent the victim's blood from clotting, but actually promote the bleeding of the wound. The resulting blood loss is so rapid that it causes {@dice 1d4} points of damage per round. After the initial hit is scored, further rolls to inflict damage are not required.",
					"When the lair of a pack of giant weasels is found, it often contains a minimum of four animals. There are young equal to the number of adults in the lair; the young are from 10% to 80% grown. They attack just as the adults would, inflicting damage appropriate to their degree of growth. If taken before they are half-grown, there is a chance that giant weasels can be trained to serve as hunting or guard animals.",
					"The pelts of giant weasels are valuable, as are those of their smaller cousins, and an intact one can fetch from 1,000 to 6,000 gold pieces on the open market. As a general rule, the most valuable pelts are those of the northern species, which are wholly white in color, or those of the rare black weasels."

					"DESCRIPTION",
					"The giff are a race of powerfully muscled mercenaries. They are civilized, though they lack mages among their own race. Giff hire on with various groups throughout the universe as mercenaries, bodyguards, enforcers, and general legbreakers.",
					"The giff is humanoid, with stocky, flat, cylindrical legs and a humanoid torso, arms, and fingers. Its chest is broad and supports a hippopotamus head with a natural helmet of flexible, chitinous plates. Giff come in colors ranging from black to gray to a rich gold, and many have colorful tattoos that leave their bodies a patchwork record of past victories. Giff speak their own language and the Common tongue.",
					"HABITAT / SOCIETY",
					"The giff are happiest among their own race they consider larger races such as giants threatening and complain about the fragility of the smaller races. Unlike the dracons, they suffer no penalties for being apart from their fellows, but merely prefer the company of their own species. Outside their own platoons, the giff are happiest among military organizations with a strong chain of command.",
					"Every giff, male, female, and giffling, has a rank within society, which can only be changed by someone of higher rank. Within this rank are subranks and within those subranks are color markings and badges. The highest-ranking giff gives the orders, the others obey. It does not matter if the orders are foolish or even suicidal following them is the purpose of the giff in the universe. A quasi-mystical faith among the giff mercenaries confirm that all things have their place, and the giff's is to follow orders. This makes the giff very happy.",
					"Giff platoons can be hired by those looking for their muscle. The arcane do a small business in giff mercenaries, but usually local contractors perform the task. These contractors review prospective employers according to ability to pay, then make a recommendation to the giff leaders. The leaders, in turn, consider the danger of the job, and whether taking it will enhance their giffdom.",
					"Giff jobs are usually paid in smoke powder, though they often will accept other weapons and armor. It is purely a barter system, but to hire one giff for one standard week requires seven charges of smoke powder (one/day). In areas where smoke powder is more common, the price will rise.",
					"On board ship, the giff have their own quarters, and will often request to bring on their own large weapons. They favor greek fire projectors and bombards for ground work, and will happily blaze away at opponents, regardless of the tactical situation.",
					"The giff require the ships of others because they have no spellcasting abilities among them they are magically inert in such a way that even the serial helms of the mind flayers have no effect on them. Lifejammers are considered to be a \"wizard's way to die\" (a giff insult). Giff trade their services for transport and for weapons especially smoke powder.",
					"Giff of both sexes serve in their platoons, and both fight equally well. Gill young are raised tenderly until they are old enough to survive an exploding arquebus, then are inducted fully into the platoon.",
					"Giff are fierce fighters, despite their somewhat comical appearance and mania for weapons. They will not, however, willingly fight other giff. If forced into such a situation on a battlefield, both groups will retire for at least a day of drinking and sorting out ranks. There is a 10% chance that one platoon will join another in this case, but most likely both will quit their current hirings and look for work elsewhere.",
					"ECOLOGY",
					"Like the dracon, the giff are surmises to have evolved from one world, which was not blessed with a wide variety of intelligent species such as elves, men, dwarves, and beholders. Sages point to the giff as an example of what happens when only one sentient species is found on a planet.",
					"The giff homeworld is the stuff of legend; as no living giff has seen it. Some tales say that the homeworld was destroyed by the giff, who were rescued by the arcane. Others say that the giff sold their planet and their lives to the arcane in exchange for spelljamming helms they could not use. Still others say that the giff homeworld is just beyond the range of one's ship, in a land where such warrior races are common, and the losers are exiled to the known worlds.",
					"Whatever the truth, the giff describe their homeworld in legendary terms a thick, verdant jungle, covered with swamps, mangrove trees, and fruit plants. The few mountains are rich in metals, caches of weapons. and smoke powder.",
					"The giff practice equality among the sexes in battle and in childrearing. They live about 70 years, but do not take aging gracefully. As a giff grows older and begins to slow down, he is possessed with the idea of proving himself still young and vital, usually in battle. As a result, there are very, very few old giff."

					"Githyanki are strongly humanoid in appearance. They are approximately of human height but tend to be much more gaunt and long of limb. They have rough, yellow skin and gleaming black eyes that instantly betray their inhumanness. Like many demihuman races, their ears have sharp points and are serrated at the back. Dress for the githyanki is always an elaborate affair. Their baroque armor and weapons of war are decorated with feathers, beads, and precious metals and gems.",
					"HABITAT / SOCIETY",
					"History provides some information on the githyanki their race is both ancient and reclusive. Sages believe they once were humans that were captured by mind flayers to serve as slaves and cattle. The mind flayers treated their human slaves cruelly and the people harbored a deep resentment toward them. For centuries these humans increased their hatred but could not summon the strength necessary to break free. So they waited for many years, developing their power in secret, waiting for an opportunity to strike out against their masters. Finally, a woman of power came forth among them, a deliverer by the name of Gith. She convinced the people to rise up against their cruel masters. The struggle was long and vicious, but eventually the people freed themselves. They had earned their freedom and become the githyanki, (which, in their tongue, means sons of Gith).",
					"These astral beings progress through levels exactly as a human would. However, there has never been a githyanki that has progressed beyond the 11th level of experience and very few progress beyond 9th. When a githyanki advances to 9th level, he is tested by the lich-queen. This grueling test involves survival in one of lower planes for a number of weeks. Failure quite obviously results in death. Githyanki that reach 12th level of experience are immediately drawn out of the Astral plane and into the presence of the lich-queen where their life force is drawn to feed the ravenous hunger of the cruel demi-goddess.",
					"Githyanki dwell in huge castles on the Astral plane. These ornately decorated castles are avoided by all other dwellers on the Astral plane for the githyanki are infamous for being inhospitable to strangers.",
					"A githyanki stronghold will be ruled by a supreme leader. This leader will be a fighter or mage of 10th. The supreme leader is the undisputed overlord of the castle with the power of life and death over all who dwell there. A typical leader will be equipped with 2d4 random magical items in addition to the weapons described above.",
					"All castles have a retinue of 20-80 knights of 9th level that serve as the supreme leader's elite shock troops. They are fanatically loyal. There will also be up to 1,000 githyanki of lesser status.",
					"Githyanki, having the ability to plane shift at will, often travel to the Prime Material plane. These treks across the planes often lead to the formation of underground lairs used to mount surface raids, though their hatred is more often directed against mind flayers. Outside the war with the githzerai, these raids are conducted largely for the perverse pleasure of the kill.",

					"DESCRIPTION",
					"Githyanki are an ancient race descended from humans. They dwell upon the Astral plane but will often leave that plane to make war on other races. They are engaged in a lengthy war with the githzerai.",
					"Githyanki are strongly humanoid in appearance. They are approximately of human height but tend to be much more gaunt and long of limb. They have rough, yellow skin and gleaming black eyes that instantly betray their inhumanness. Like many demihuman races, their ears have sharp points and are serrated at the back. Dress for the githyanki is always an elaborate affair. Their baroque armor and weapons of war are decorated with feathers, beads, and precious metals and gems.",
					"HABITAT / SOCIETY",
					"History provides some information on the githyanki their race is both ancient and reclusive. Sages believe they once were humans that were captured by mind flayers to serve as slaves and cattle. The mind flayers treated their human slaves cruelly and the people harbored a deep resentment toward them. For centuries these humans increased their hatred but could not summon the strength necessary to break free. So they waited for many years, developing their power in secret, waiting for an opportunity to strike out against their masters. Finally, a woman of power came forth among them, a deliverer by the name of Gith. She convinced the people to rise up against their cruel masters. The struggle was long and vicious, but eventually the people freed themselves. They had earned their freedom and become the githyanki, (which, in their tongue, means sons of Gith).",
					"These astral beings progress through levels exactly as a human would. However, there has never been a githyanki that has progressed beyond the 11th level of experience and very few progress beyond 9th. When a githyanki advances to 9th level, he is tested by the lich-queen. This grueling test involves survival in one of lower planes for a number of weeks. Failure quite obviously results in death. Githyanki that reach 12th level of experience are immediately drawn out of the Astral plane and into the presence of the lich-queen where their life force is drawn to feed the ravenous hunger of the cruel demi-goddess.",
					"Githyanki dwell in huge castles on the Astral plane. These ornately decorated castles are avoided by all other dwellers on the Astral plane for the githyanki are infamous for being inhospitable to strangers.",
					"A githyanki stronghold will be ruled by a supreme leader. This leader will be a fighter or mage of 10th. The supreme leader is the undisputed overlord of the castle with the power of life and death over all who dwell there. A typical leader will be equipped with 2d4 random magical items in addition to the weapons described above.",
					"All castles have a retinue of 20-80 knights of 9th level that serve as the supreme leader's elite shock troops. They are fanatically loyal. There will also be up to 1,000 githyanki of lesser status.",
					"Githyanki, having the ability to plane shift at will, often travel to the Prime Material plane. These treks across the planes often lead to the formation of underground lairs used to mount surface raids, though their hatred is more often directed against mind flayers. Outside the war with the githzerai, these raids are conducted largely for the perverse pleasure of the kill.",
					"A typical githyanki lair on the Prime Material plane will contain the following:",
					"One supreme leader 11th-level fighter or 7th mage",
					"Two captains 8th-level fighter and 7th mage",
					"One knight 8th level",
					"Two warlocks mages of 7th level",
					"Three sergeants fighters of 7th level",
					"Two 'gish' fighter/mages of 4th/4th level",
					"20-50 lower levels determined randomly using the table above, of 1st-3rd level",
					"On the Prime Material plane, githyanki have a pact with a group of red dragons. These proud creatures will act as mounts and companions to the githyanki. When encountered on the Prime Material plane and outside their lair, a githyanki group will typically consist of the following:",
					"One captain 8th-level fighter",
					"One warlock 7th-level mage",
					"Five lower githyankis fighters of 1st-3rd level",
					"Such a group will have two red dragons as steeds, transporting between four and six githyanki per dragon. The dragons will fight for the safety and well-being of the githyanki but will not directly risk their lives, fleeing when the battle is turned against them. Just what the githyanki offer the red dragons in return for these services is unknown.",
					"An interesting aspect of githyanki society is the apparent bond between military leaders and their subordinates. This bond allows a leader to give his men short, almost senseless commands (to human standards) and actually relay complex and exacting messages. Although this has no actual affect during the melee round, it often leads to more effective ambushes and attacks and allows complex military decisions to be relayed quickly.",
					"ECOLOGY",
					"Githyankis have similar ecology to that of humans. However, the Astral plane does not offer the same type of environments as the Prime Material plane, so their cultural groups are much different. In a society where farmers and tradesmen are unnecessary, more unique, specialized groups have evolved.",
					"G''lathk: The g''lathk, (admittedly nearly unpronounceable in human tongues) are the equivalent of farmers. Due to the barrenness of the Astral plane, the githyanki are forced to grow food in vast, artificial chambers. They rely upon a variety of fungi and other plants that require no sunlight to grow. The g''lathk are also experts in aquatic plantlife, sometimes tending gigantic water-gardens.",
					"Mlar: Not all magic-using githyanki ever attain the power and self-discipline necessary to become wizards. Some use their magical talents in the field of architecture and construction. The mlar are such individuals, focusing their creative energies toward designing and constructing the buildings and structures used in day-to-day life in githyanki society. The mlar have developed their jobs into an art form.",
					"Hr'a'cknir: The Astral plane has many strange energies moving through it. Some of these energies are obvious to the senses, such as heat and light. Others are not so easily observed. There are many psychic and strange astral energies that humans generally are not aware of. Being a psychically aware race, however, the githyanki cannot only sense these energies, but harness them too. The hr'a'cknir are the collectors of those energies. They are similar to the mlar, in that they use innate magical powers to perform their crafts.",
					"More than humans, githyanki are hunters and predators. They will typically engage in raiding and plundering seemingly for the joy they derive from it. It is likely that the long centuries of enslavement of their race has caused the githyanki to bully those weaker than themselves.",
					"Unlike humans, though, the githyanki never war amongst themselves. The split of the githyanki and the githzerai is the closest thing the gith races have known to civil war. Githyanki never battles githyanki. It is the unwritten rule of gith society and is never broken. This, too, may be an effect of the race's enslavement."

					"One warlock 7th-level mage",
					"Five lower githyankis fighters of 1st-3rd level",
					"Such a group will have two red dragons as steeds, transporting between four and six githyanki per dragon. The dragons will fight for the safety and well-being of the githyanki but will not directly risk their lives, fleeing when the battle is turned against them. Just what the githyanki offer the red dragons in return for these services is unknown.",
					"An interesting aspect of githyanki society is the apparent bond between military leaders and their subordinates. This bond allows a leader to give his men short, almost senseless commands (to human standards) and actually relay complex and exacting messages. Although this has no actual affect during the melee round, it often leads to more effective ambushes and attacks and allows complex military decisions to be relayed quickly.",
					"ECOLOGY",
					"Githyankis have similar ecology to that of humans. However, the Astral plane does not offer the same type of environments as the Prime Material plane, so their cultural groups are much different. In a society where farmers and tradesmen are unnecessary, more unique, specialized groups have evolved.",
					"G''lathk: The g''lathk, (admittedly nearly unpronounceable in human tongues) are the equivalent of farmers. Due to the barrenness of the Astral plane, the githyanki are forced to grow food in vast, artificial chambers. They rely upon a variety of fungi and other plants that require no sunlight to grow. The g''lathk are also experts in aquatic plantlife, sometimes tending gigantic water-gardens.",
					"Mlar: Not all magic-using githyanki ever attain the power and self-discipline necessary to become wizards. Some use their magical talents in the field of architecture and construction. The mlar are such individuals, focusing their creative energies toward designing and constructing the buildings and structures used in day-to-day life in githyanki society. The mlar have developed their jobs into an art form.",
					"Hr'a'cknir: The Astral plane has many strange energies moving through it. Some of these energies are obvious to the senses, such as heat and light. Others are not so easily observed. There are many psychic and strange astral energies that humans generally are not aware of. Being a psychically aware race, however, the githyanki cannot only sense these energies, but harness them too. The hr'a'cknir are the collectors of those energies. They are similar to the mlar, in that they use innate magical powers to perform their crafts.",
					"More than humans, githyanki are hunters and predators. They will typically engage in raiding and plundering seemingly for the joy they derive from it. It is likely that the long centuries of enslavement of their race has caused the githyanki to bully those weaker than themselves.",
					"Unlike humans, though, the githyanki never war amongst themselves. The split of the githyanki and the githzerai is the closest thing the gith races have known to civil war. Githyanki never battles githyanki. It is the unwritten rule of gith society and is never broken. This, too, may be an effect of the race's enslavement."

					"DESCRIPTION",
					"Githzerai are very similar in appearance to their githyanki cousins, although they tend to look much more human. Their features are for the most part unremarkable, with vaguely noble countenance. Their skin tone is that of human caucasian flesh. Githzerai dress simply, wearing functional clothing and favoring conservative tones.",
					"HABITAT / SOCIETY",
					"The githzerai were originally offspring of a race of humans that were freed from slavery under mind flayers by a great female warrior named Gith. These men and women did not, however, choose to follow Gith's ways after they revolted against their slavers. Instead, they fell sway to the teachings of a powerful wizard who proclaimed himself king and later, god of the people. The githzerai then separated themselves from the githyanki, beginning a great racial war that has endured the long millennia without diminishing.",
					"The githzerai, who worship a powerful and ancient wizard as though he were a god (he is not), are destroyed before they have enough power to become a threat to their ruler.",
					"If encountered outside of their lair, githzerai will usually be in the following numbers:",
					"One supreme leader 9th-level fighter or 7th-level mage",
					"One captain 6th-level fighter or 4th-level mage",
					"Two warlocks mages of 5th level",
					"Three sergeants fighters of 5th level",
					"Three 'zerths' fighter/mages of 3rd/3rd level",
					"1d4+1 x 10 lesser githzerai evenly distributed between the three possible classes and of 1st to 3rd level",
					"A thief, if present (10% chance), will replace one of the lower level githzerai and will be of 10th level.",
					"The githzerai dwell primarily on the plane of Limbo. They have mighty fortresses in that plane of chaos and their position there is very strong. Typically, one of these fortresses contains approximately 3,000 githzerai led by a single supreme leader. This leader has absolute control over the githzerai, including the powers of life and death.",
					"The githzerai hold only a few fortresses on the Prime Material plane, but these are particularly strong holdings, with walls of adamantite rising as huge squat towers from dusty plains. Each houses approximately 500 githzerai, including a supreme leader.",
					"On Limbo, however, the githzerai presence is very strong. Living in cities typically of 100,000 or more, the githzerai enjoy total power over themselves on an otherwise chaotic and unpredictable plane. One notable example of this is the city Shra'kt'lor. This large githzerai capital is composed of some 2,000,000 githzerai living in great power. Shra'kt'lor serves as both a capital and as a headquarters for all githzerai military matters. The greatest generals and nobles of the race meet here to plan githzerai strategy for battling both the githyanki and the mind flayers. There is likely no force on Limbo that could readily threaten the power of Shra'kt'lor or its many inhabitants.",
					"One of the prime motivations among the githzerai is their war with the githyanki. These offshoots of Gith's original race are obsessed with this war of extermination. They often employ mercenaries on the Prime Material plane to aid them in battling the githyanki. The evil, destructive nature of the githyanki makes the hiring of mercenaries to fight them a relatively simple task.",
					"Legend of the Zerthimon: In githzerai lore there is a central figure that is revered above all others Zerthimon. The githyanki believe him to be a great god that was once a man. According to githzerai lore, when the original race broke free of the mind flayers, it was Zerthimon that opposed Gith, claiming that she was hateful and unfit to lead the people.",
					"There ensued a great battle and the people were polarized by the two powers. Those that chose to support Gith became the githyanki. Those that supported Zerthimon became the githzerai.",
					"Zerthimon died in the battle, but in his sacrifice he freed the githzerai from Gith. The githzerai believe that someday Zerthimon, in his new godly form, will return and take the them to a place on another plane.",
					"Zerths are special among the githzerai, acting as focal points for the attention of Zerthimon. The githzerai believe that when Zerthimon returns for them, he will first gather all of the zerths and lead them to their new paradise. It might be said that the zerths are the center of githzerai religion. Unfortunately, they are not free from religious persecution.",
					"The wizard-king (whose name is not known) that rules over the highly superstitious githzerai would like very much to stamp out the legend of Zerthimon. The wizard-king believes that this legend challenges his authority, and very likely it does. However, he has never been able to rid the githzerai of this legend and he is now forced to tolerate it.",
					"Rrakkma bands: Although the githzerai are not a bitter or overly violent race, they still tend to hold a strong enmity and hatred for the race of illithids that originally enslaved the gith race so many thousands of years ago. By human terms, that may be a very long time to hold a grudge, but the githzerai see the mind flayers as the cause of the split of the Gith race and much of the hardships the githzerai are forced to endure. Thus large rrakkma (in the githzerai tongue) bands are often formed to hunt mind flayers. These bands typically consist of 1d4+2 x 10 githzerai warriors led by the githzerai equivalent of a sergeant. For roughly three months, these bands will roam the outer and inner planes, searching for groups of illithids and destroying them utterly. The rrakkma bands are very popular in githzerai society and it is considered to be an honor to serve in one.",
					"The githzerai fortresses on the Prime Material plane tend to be very large affairs with great, impenetrable walls. Wherever these fortresses stand, they destroy the landscape for miles. No plants or animals live within many miles of the fortresses and the land is reduced to wasteland around them. It is not known if the effect is just the land's reaction to the \"other-planar\" stuff of which the castles are constructed, or if githzerai mages magically produce the effect in order to keep material beings away from these fortresses.",
					"The most likely purpose of these fortresses on the Prime Material plane is to keep tabs on the githyanki. The githzerai, not being a particularly war-mongering or violent race, have no desire to conquer the Prime Material plane like the githyanki do. However, the githzerai realize that if their enemies have a strong hold on the Prime Material plane, they will become more powerful and thus will hold power over them. The githzerai carefully monitor the progress on the githyanki and lead coordinated, focused strikes against strongpoints of the githyanki, thus hampering their ability to expand and grow in the Prime Material plane.",
					"During these attacks, the githzerai will not intentionally attack the natural denizens of the Prime Material plane (humans, demihumans, humanoids, etc.), but they will never sacrifice a well-planned attack on the githyanki just to preserve life. With the githzerai, the ends will always justify the means.",
					"Like the githyanki, the githzerai really have no part in the Blood War of the fiends. They seldom venture to the lower planes, and only then for matters of absolute importance. The githzerai find the bloodthirsty, destructive nature of the fiends to be distasteful, so they will typically not deal with those creatures for any reason. They coexist with the slaadi, and githzerai are rumored to have mental powers beyond those described here.",
					"ECOLOGY",
					"For as long as men have known of the ability to travel the planes, they have wondered at the natural power of the githzerai to wander from plane to plane at will. Although man and githzerai are not natural enemies, battles are frequently fought between the two races, due in part to some humans' desire to capture a live githzerai for study. To date, no such creature has been secured."

					"If encountered outside of their lair, githzerai will usually be in the following numbers:",
					"One supreme leader 9th-level fighter or 7th-level mage",
					"One captain 6th-level fighter or 4th-level mage",
					"Two warlocks mages of 5th level",
					"Three sergeants fighters of 5th level",
					"Three 'zerths' fighter/mages of 3rd/3rd level",
					"1d4+1 x 10 lesser githzerai evenly distributed between the three possible classes and of 1st to 3rd level",
					"A thief, if present (10% chance), will replace one of the lower level githzerai and will be of 10th level.",
					"The githzerai dwell primarily on the plane of Limbo. They have mighty fortresses in that plane of chaos and their position there is very strong. Typically, one of these fortresses contains approximately 3,000 githzerai led by a single supreme leader. This leader has absolute control over the githzerai, including the powers of life and death.",
					"The githzerai hold only a few fortresses on the Prime Material plane, but these are particularly strong holdings, with walls of adamantite rising as huge squat towers from dusty plains. Each houses approximately 500 githzerai, including a supreme leader.",
					"On Limbo, however, the githzerai presence is very strong. Living in cities typically of 100,000 or more, the githzerai enjoy total power over themselves on an otherwise chaotic and unpredictable plane. One notable example of this is the city Shra'kt'lor. This large githzerai capital is composed of some 2,000,000 githzerai living in great power. Shra'kt'lor serves as both a capital and as a headquarters for all githzerai military matters. The greatest generals and nobles of the race meet here to plan githzerai strategy for battling both the githyanki and the mind flayers. There is likely no force on Limbo that could readily threaten the power of Shra'kt'lor or its many inhabitants.",
					"One of the prime motivations among the githzerai is their war with the githyanki. These offshoots of Gith's original race are obsessed with this war of extermination. They often employ mercenaries on the Prime Material plane to aid them in battling the githyanki. The evil, destructive nature of the githyanki makes the hiring of mercenaries to fight them a relatively simple task.",
					"Legend of the Zerthimon: In githzerai lore there is a central figure that is revered above all others Zerthimon. The githyanki believe him to be a great god that was once a man. According to githzerai lore, when the original race broke free of the mind flayers, it was Zerthimon that opposed Gith, claiming that she was hateful and unfit to lead the people.",
					"There ensued a great battle and the people were polarized by the two powers. Those that chose to support Gith became the githyanki. Those that supported Zerthimon became the githzerai.",
					"Zerthimon died in the battle, but in his sacrifice he freed the githzerai from Gith. The githzerai believe that someday Zerthimon, in his new godly form, will return and take the them to a place on another plane.",
					"Zerths are special among the githzerai, acting as focal points for the attention of Zerthimon. The githzerai believe that when Zerthimon returns for them, he will first gather all of the zerths and lead them to their new paradise. It might be said that the zerths are the center of githzerai religion. Unfortunately, they are not free from religious persecution.",
					"The wizard-king (whose name is not known) that rules over the highly superstitious githzerai would like very much to stamp out the legend of Zerthimon. The wizard-king believes that this legend challenges his authority, and very likely it does. However, he has never been able to rid the githzerai of this legend and he is now forced to tolerate it.",
					"Rrakkma bands: Although the githzerai are not a bitter or overly violent race, they still tend to hold a strong enmity and hatred for the race of illithids that originally enslaved the gith race so many thousands of years ago. By human terms, that may be a very long time to hold a grudge, but the githzerai see the mind flayers as the cause of the split of the Gith race and much of the hardships the githzerai are forced to endure. Thus large rrakkma (in the githzerai tongue) bands are often formed to hunt mind flayers. These bands typically consist of 1d4+2 x 10 githzerai warriors led by the githzerai equivalent of a sergeant. For roughly three months, these bands will roam the outer and inner planes, searching for groups of illithids and destroying them utterly. The rrakkma bands are very popular in githzerai society and it is considered to be an honor to serve in one.",
					"The githzerai fortresses on the Prime Material plane tend to be very large affairs with great, impenetrable walls. Wherever these fortresses stand, they destroy the landscape for miles. No plants or animals live within many miles of the fortresses and the land is reduced to wasteland around them. It is not known if the effect is just the land's reaction to the \"other-planar\" stuff of which the castles are constructed, or if githzerai mages magically produce the effect in order to keep material beings away from these fortresses.",
					"The most likely purpose of these fortresses on the Prime Material plane is to keep tabs on the githyanki. The githzerai, not being a particularly war-mongering or violent race, have no desire to conquer the Prime Material plane like the githyanki do. However, the githzerai realize that if their enemies have a strong hold on the Prime Material plane, they will become more powerful and thus will hold power over them. The githzerai carefully monitor the progress on the githyanki and lead coordinated, focused strikes against strongpoints of the githyanki, thus hampering their ability to expand and grow in the Prime Material plane.",
					"During these attacks, the githzerai will not intentionally attack the natural denizens of the Prime Material plane (humans, demihumans, humanoids, etc.), but they will never sacrifice a well-planned attack on the githyanki just to preserve life. With the githzerai, the ends will always justify the means.",
					"Like the githyanki, the githzerai really have no part in the Blood War of the fiends. They seldom venture to the lower planes, and only then for matters of absolute importance. The githzerai find the bloodthirsty, destructive nature of the fiends to be distasteful, so they will typically not deal with those creatures for any reason. They coexist with the slaadi, and githzerai are rumored to have mental powers beyond those described here.",
					"ECOLOGY",
					"For as long as men have known of the ability to travel the planes, they have wondered at the natural power of the githzerai to wander from plane to plane at will. Although man and githzerai are not natural enemies, battles are frequently fought between the two races, due in part to some humans' desire to capture a live githzerai for study. To date, no such creature has been secured."

					"They have greenish gray skin, darker near the muzzle, with a short reddish gray to dull yellow mane. Gnolls have their own language and many also speak the tongues of flinds, trolls, orcs, or hobgoblins.",
					"HABITAT / SOCIETY",
					"Gnolls are most often encountered underground or inside abandoned ruins. When above ground they operate primarily at night. Gnoll society is ruled by the strongest, using fear and intimidation. When found underground, they will have (30% chance) 1d3 trolls as guards and servants.",
					"Above ground they keep pets (65% of the time) such as 4d4 hyenas (80%) or 2d6 hyaenodons (20%) which can act as guards. A gnoll lair will contain between 20d10 adult males. For every 20 gnoll, there will be a 7 Hit Die leader. If 100 or more are encountered there will also be a chieftain who has 10 Hit Dice, an Armor Class of 17, and who receives a +5 to hit and +3 on damage rolls due to his great strength. Further, each chieftain will be protected by 2d6 elite warrior guards of 7 Hit Dice (AC 16).",
					"In a lair, there will be females equal to half the number of males. Females are equal to males in combat, though not usually as well armed or armored. There will also be twice as many young as there are adults in the lair, but they do not fight. Gnolls always have at least 1 slave for every 10 adults in the lair, and may have many more.",
					"Gnolls will work together with orcs, hobgoblins, bugbears, ogres, and trolls. If encountered as a group, there must be a relative equality of strength. Otherwise the polls will kill and eat their partners (hunger comes before friendship or fear) or be killed and eaten by them. They dislike goblins, kobolds, giants, humans, demi-humans and any type of manual labor.",
					"ECOLOGY",
					"Gnolls eat anything warm blooded, favoring intelligent creatures over animals because they scream better. They will completely hunt out an area before moving on. It may take several years for the game to return. When allowed to die of old age,",

Hunters are particularly skilled with the longbow,",

Even when a hunter doesn't kill its target with its first shot, the arrow strike brings so much pain that the victim is hobbled in its attempt to run away. When a hunter on the prowl finds prey and isn't concerned about remaining stealthy, it sounds a horn crafted from bone that produces a keening wail similar to a banshee's yell."

					"Gorgons are fierce, bull-like beasts who make their lairs in dreary caverns or the fastness of a wilderness. They are aggressive by nature and usually attack any creature or person they encounter.",
					"Monstrous black bulls, gorgons have hides of thick metal scales. Their breath is a noxious vapor that billows forth in great puffs from their wide, bull nostrils. Gorgons walk on two hooves, when necessary, but usually assume a four-hoofed stance. Despite their great size, they can move through even heavy forests with incredible speed, for they simply trample bushes and splinter smaller trees. Gorgons speak no languages but let out a roar of anger whenever they encounter other beings.",
					"HABITAT / SOCIETY",
					"It is believed that gorgons can actually devour the living statues they create with their breath weapon. Whether their flat iron teeth break up and pulverize the stone or their saliva returns the victim to flesh while they eat is a matter for conjecture.",
					"Their primary prey are deer and elk, but gorgons won't hesitate to add other meats to their diet when hungry. Their sense of smell is acute and once they get on the trail gorgons are 75% likely to track their victim successfully. Once their victim is in sight, gorgons let out a scream of rage and then charge. Unless somehow evaded, a gorgon will pursue tirelessly, for days if necessary, until the prey either drops from exhaustion or is caught in the gorgon's deadly breath.",
					"Gorgons have no use for treasure, hence gold and gems are often left petrified on the statue of the being that once wore them. Occasionally a gorgon in his haste will devour something of value; the items will later be left in the gorgon's droppings, somewhere near the entrance to its lair.",
					"Gorgons are usually encountered in groups of three or four one male bull with two or three females. Gorgon calves are raised by the females to the age of two, then the young bulls are turned out to make their own way. Females remain with the dominant bull.",
					"About 25% of the time only a single gorgon is encountered. Lone gorgons are always rogue males in search of females.",
					"The forest around a gorgon lair is usually a crisscrossing network of trails and paths they've made. Occasionally there are clearings where the grasses were trampled down in a battle and perhaps the shattered remains of a statue can be found.",
					"ECOLOGY",
					"Gorgons have no natural enemies other than themselves. Bull gorgons are often called upon to defend their positions against rogue gorgons. These battles are not usually fatal, but even a gorgon can be felled by a well-aimed horn gore. The only other creature known to hunt these fierce predators is man.",
					"Gorgon blood, properly prepared, can seal an area against ethereal or astral intrusion; their powdered scales are an ingredient in the ink used to create a {@spell Protection from Poison|PHB|protection from petrification} scroll.",
					"In addition, the hide of a gorgon can be fashioned, with considerable work and some magical enhancement, into a fine set of scale mail. This armor will provide the wearer with a +2 bonus to all saving throws vs. petrification or flesh-to-stone spells."

					"DESCRIPTION",
					"Collectively known as goristroi, these huge tanar'ri can be found on nearly any plane of the Abyss, for they are adaptable and much desired by the rulers of the place to serve as engines of destruction.",
					"Abyssal lords and powers are able to command the goristroi and keep them serving as guardians, enforcers, siege engines, and so on. The hulking goristroi are too stupid and bestial to do more than carry out their orders, and thus their status never reaches that or the true tanar'ri.",
					"Gorislroi are vaguely reminiscent of giant bears, although their shoulder are broader, their visages a nightmarish cross between bison and human, and their hands and feet disproportionately large, splayed, and humanlike.",
					"Their arms are extremely long, like an ape's. Individual colors vary from dark brown through sickly greenish yellow to a peculiar purplish gray.",
					"From the third volume of \"Deception And Strategems\", by the pit fiend Mellagorus:",
					"Though the lumbering goristroi are excellent at climbing sheer stone faces and though these assaults can break our fortications, such strategies also present us with an opportunity to destroy the beasts.",
					"Their powerful clawed fingers can make handholds in sheer stone, but their enormous size makes them vulnerable to falls, and they suffer twice the damage a smaller creature might from a fall.",
					"The goristroi are especially afraid of Bigby's forceful hand, dig, fly, levitation, and other spells that can push them off the heights to be broken on the rocks below or, even more amusingly, onto the weapons of their fellow tanar'ri.",
					"Weak-minded goristroi are also vulnerable to spells such as cause fear, fear, symbol of fear, and repulsion, which drive them off walls.",
					"For all these reasons, arcanaloth are the best countermeasures to employ against goristroi assaults on an entrenched position on the height.",
					"Fools though they are, tanar'ri commanders rarely order a goristro over the walls unless the situation is desperate or a diversionary attack has drawn off most of the defenders.",
					"Take this as a sign of weakness and counterattack.",
					"Usually solitary, goristroi are only important among their kin because of their ability to absorb damage and to mete it out.",
					"They are stupid and otherwise limited in power, unable even to gate in other tanar'ri. The vast majority of goristroi encountered are in the service of some Abyssal ruler, blindly carrying out the duties assigned to them with complete fanaticism.",
					"There is never a question of retreat or morale when dealing with these brutes, though the threat of long falls can induce paralysis on the field of action. In all other respects, they always continue to follow their given commands until completion or death occurs.",
					"In the Blood War the goristroi serve as siege engines and rallying points for lesser tanar'ri, much as elephants do among some prime-material worlds.",
					"A goristroi citadel is a platform strapped to the creature's head and shoulders like a helmet. The tanar'ri carries this citadel as a lesser creature might carry a knapsack; it hardly seems aware of it.",
					"Again from Mellagorus' \"Deception And Strategems\"",
					"Goristroi citadels are dangerous and best kept busy with cannon fodder and inferior troops, but if they can be broken the lesser troops surrounding them are usually routed. The best way to accomplish this is to harry a goristro from two directions.",
					"The retarded behemoth will turn from one attack to the other, unconscious of the fact that its rapid movements are shaking and battering the creatures within the citadel to death. At this point flying troops such as abishai can take the citadel and slay the goristro by a surgical strike to the neck with axes, polearms, and cleavers.",
					"Goristroi ruled by an Abyssal lord or power always wear some symbol of servitude, such as a collar, an arm or wrist band, or an implanted symbol. Such devices zypically have the power to conves telepathic commands to the wearer as well as serve as tracking devices should the masters wish to know the whereabouts of their servants.",
					"Without direct command or supervision, goristroi tend to wander off on destructive rampages of their own direction and desire.",
					"Goristroi do not breed naturally. They are carefully mated by their owners after extensive negotiations, eventually resulting in a single young. The goristroi are carefully watched throughout the entire process, for fear of foul play by the other side, such as an attempt to slay these valuable beasts.",
					"Generally, the terms are that the owner of the male goristroi gains the female young, and the owner of the mother is entitled to the male young produced. The young grow to maturity within five voracious, screaming years.",
					"This allows the lucky owner to breed further young on his own, albeit inbred ones. However, abductions, infanticide (if the young is the wrong gender), and even outright purchases of the live young are fairy common. Under no circumstances are the parents allowed to have any influence on the young goristro.",
					"ECOLOGY",
					"Goristroi are predators that make no distinction between various types of prey. They eat anything that moves, even among their own kind, devouring lesser tanar'ri when their dim minds believe no one is watching.",
					"They are exclusively carnivorous, unable to eat vegetable matter even if no other food is available. If forced to go without living or recently slain meat, goristroi wither and die within two weeks, so tanar'ri commanders usually sacrifice lesser troops for the sake of keeping their citadels going.",
					"Goristroi flesh is itself poisonous if ingested, so not even powerful planar creatures or pack hunters like trolls and armanites attack them."

					"Abishai are common to the first and second layers of Baator. They look like gothic gargoyles, thin and reptilian, with long, prehensile tails and large wings. The three varieties of abishai have different skin colors in ascending order of station, black, green, and red. All have a vinegary smell and rasping voices. The air seems to warm perceptibly in their presence.",
					"HABITAT / SOCIETY",
					"Abishai are voracious and evil. They delight in tormenting those few baatezu lower in station than themselves. Abishai tempt mortals bold enough to travel to Baator by using their {@spell Alter Self} and {@spell Charm Person} abilities to impersonate more powerful baatezu.",
					"ECOLOGY",
					"The abishai make up large, evil armies that fight the {@creature tanar'ri|AGGMM4} and intruders into Baator. In some cases, a red abishai may prove worthy enough to command a force of lemures. If successful, the red abishai may be promoted to a higher form of {@creature baatezu|AGGMM}.",
					"As part of their efforts to corrupt mortals, abishai like to bestow powerful magic on inexperienced wizards. Usually the low-level spellcaster cannot control these enormous energies, and chaos and destruction result."

The \"civilized\" grell is a hive or colony creature, much like an ant or a bee, but far more intelligent, arrogant, and dangerous.",
					"Grell have a weird language composed of bird-like squawks and chirps, combined with tentacular motion and a limited telepathy with other grell. Other creatures cannot learn the grell language, and they would not deign to learn the language of \"lesser beings\" (a synonym for \"food\" in their language).",

					"Soldier/Worker: These are the common grell that form the bulk of a hive or a raiding party. Occasionally, a grell will become separated from its fellows; these become rogues. Rogues carry no weapons, collect no treasure, and avoid sunlight.",
					"Philosopher: These grell serve as intermediaries between patriarchs and workers/soldiers. Some lead lesser grell in combat, and there is one philosopher for every 10 lesser grell encountered. Some philosophers (20%) wear rings of protection+1. About 10% of philosophers can cast spells as 2nd-level warlock.",
					"Patriarch: Each hive has a patriarch, a huge, sedentary mass of flesh that directs the lesser grell. If the patriarch is taken to a ship, it can dig its many tentacles into the ship and animate it, even make it fly to other worlds."

					"DESCRIPTION",
					"Half-lion, half-eagle, griffons are ferocious avian carnivores that prey upon horses and their kin (hippogriffs, pegasi, and unicorns). This hunger for horseflesh often brings griffons into direct conflict with humans and demihumans. Adult griffons stand five feet at the shoulder and weigh over half a ton. Their head, upper torso, and forelegs are like those of a giant eagle.",
					"This eagle half is covered in golden feathers from its wing tips to its razor-sharp beak. Their powerful forelimbs end in long, hooked talons. Wings, with a span of 25 feet or more, rise out of their backs. The lower half of a griffon is that of a lion. Dusky yellow fur covers the lion half's muscular rear legs and clawed feet.",
					"A lion's tail hangs down from the griffon's powerful rear haunches. Griffons speak no languages, but emit an eagle-like screech when angered or excited (usually by the smell of horse).",
					"HABITAT / SOCIETY",
					"Griffons prefer rocky habitats, near open plains. Once griffons establish their territory, they remain until the food supply has been exhausted. Griffons, like lions, live in prides, with each pride comprising several mated pairs, their young, and one dominant male.",
					"The dominant male is responsible for settling territorial disputes with other prides and choosing the direction the hunt will take. Each pair of mated griffons in the pride has its own nest, located near the pride's other lairs. Griffon nests are usually situated in shallow caves, high along a cliff face.",
					"The nests are made of sticks and leaves, as well as an occasional bone. Griffons collect no treasure, but their caves frequently contain the remains of unfortunate travelers who tried to protect their horses from the griffons. During spring, female griffons lay one or two eggs that hatch in the late summer.",
					"For the first three months griffon young are known as hatchlings; thereafter, until they mature the young are called fledglings. Griffon young grow rapidly for three years until they are large enough to hunt with the pride. Adult griffons are extremely protective of their young and attack without mercy any creature that approaches within 100 feet of the nest.",
					"ECOLOGY",
					"If trained from a very early age (three years or less), griffons will serve as mounts. The training, however, is both time-consuming and expensive, requiring the expertise of an animal trainer for two years.",
					"Once trained, though, griffons make fierce and loyal steeds, bonding with one master for life, and protecting him even unto death. A griffon mount knows no fear in battle, but attacks any horse or horse-kin in preference to other opponents.",
					"Acquiring a griffon fledgling is a very dangerous venture as the adults never stray far from the nest and fight to the death to defend eggs or young. Any given griffon nest is 75% likely to contain one or two fledglings or eggs. Fledgling griffons sell for 5,000 gold pieces on the open market; eggs sell for 2,000 gold pieces each.",
					"Griffon is employed as component to empower the following spells: {@spell Feather Fall}"

					"Grimlocks have thick, scaly, grey skin and long, black, filthy hair. Their teeth are white and extremely sharp. Their eyes are blank white orbs.",
					"Grimlocks are totally blind, but have highly developed senses of smell and hearing. Their sensitive ears and noses combine to allow them to distinguish objects and creatures within 30′, just as well as if they were able to see.",
					"COMBAT",
					"Grimlocks are immune to the effects of spells which affect the vision, like phantasmal force, darkness, invisibility, mirror image, and many others.",
					"However, spells such as audible glamer, or any loud, continuous noise will partially \"blind\" them. This reduces their ability to perceive opponents to a 10 feet range and impose them disadvantage on their attack rolls. Substances such as snuff or strong perfumes will have much the same effect if inhaled by a grimlock or thrown in its face.",
					"Grimlocks attack fiercely, but with little or no organization, often stopping in the middle of battle to carry off fallen foes or comrades for food.",
					"Grimlocks will nearly always attack in darkness if possible. While not adversely affected by light, they are intelligent enough to realize that in total darkness, their unique form of perception gives them a distinct advantage.",
					"Since their acute hearing allows them to communicate in voices too faint for other races to hear, grimlocks impose disadvantage on perception checks to be spotted before an attack.",
					"The average size of a grimlock tribe counts 20-200 (20d10) individuals.",
					"For every 10 grimlocks encountered there will be a Grimlock Leader.",
					"For every 40 grimlocks encountered there will be a Champion.",
					"These exceptional individuals will usually be the only ones to show even the most elemental strategy, usually by allowing their followers to weaken opponents before entering battle themselves.",
					"In addition, at DM's discretion, for every leader or champion with the group all grimlocks get a +1 bonus on Wisdom saving throws.",
					"HABITAT / SOCIETY",
					"Grimlocks lair in vast cavern complexes in mountainous areas. They are well adapted to these environs. In any rocky terrain they blend in so well that, while motionless, they are completely undetectable unless one actually bumps into them.",
					"In any grimlock lair, there will be nearly as many females (1 Hit Die and AC 6) as males, and at least as many young (1 hit point, AC 6 and non-combatant). Grimlock leaders and champions do wield some control over these communities. However, this control is usually effective only as long as the leader who gave the order is around to enforce his will.",
					"It is nearly impossible for those of other races to tell one grimlock from another although leader types may appear slightly larger but they easily tell each other apart by subtle differences in scent and movement.",
					"Extremely xenophobic, grimlocks rarely consort with other races. However, there is a small (10%) chance that they will allow medusae to share their lairs, and a 2% chance that any wandering group will be accompanied by 1-2 mind flayers.",
					"ECOLOGY",
					"Grimlocks will only eat the raw flesh of humanoid creatures, vastly preferring that of humans to all others. Foraging parties often raid the homes of other subterranean races, especially those who keep large slave populations (such as drow). They are often on good terms with mind flayers since illithids have a large supply of humanoid bodies discarded after they have devoured the brains. Grimlocks are particularly hated by githyanki for this reason. Since the slave flesh the grimlocks often consume (raw) is frequently unwholesome, whole communities are often decimated by disease.",

					"DESCRIPTION",
					"Grung are highly territorial, toad-like humanoids that dwell in swamps and marshes.",
					"Standing about three feet tall, grung have lower bodies that strongly resemble those of giant frogs or toads, with powerful legs and large webbed feet. Their upper bodies, however, are more developed, with muscular forelimbs, opposable thumbs, and smaller, more humanoid looking heads. They stand upright and move in rapid, short hops. They are incapable of the prodigious leaps and jumps of frogs, toads, or bullywugs.",
					"While evolution has given them intelligence and forelimbs capable of using tools, it has taken away the prehensile tongues of frogs. In its place, the grung's wide mouths are full of the sharp teeth needed by carnivores Grung have the slick, wet skin of other amphibians. Since they breathe through their skin, they must keep it moist. Their coloration is like that of bullfrogs dappled green and brown on their backs, shading to white or yellow on their bellies. Their eyes smaller than those of frogs and toads and protected by bony ridges are red with black pupils. Males are slightly smaller than females.",
					"HABITAT / SOCIETY",
					"Grung are war-like, territorial creatures. They typically claim all territory within at least a mile of their tribal settlements. Anyone unwise enough to enter this territory is a target for immediate attack. Grung from other tribes are also fair game; nasty little border wars between neighboring tribes are the rule, not the exception. Most encounters with grung are with wandering war bands looking for trespassers. Grung are always hostile and cannot be negotiated with.",
					"Grung settlements are untidy collections of crude shelters, sometimes concealed inside large dead trees. tribes number 10d6+40 individuals, with young comprising 25% of that number (AC 10, Sw 12, HD ½, #AT 1, Dmg 1 [no poison], SA nil). Grung lay eggs, and their offspring go through a tadpole stage. For this reason, grung settlements are always next to open water. Within three months of hatching, the tadpoles absorb their tails, develop limbs, and climb out of the water and join the tribe as immature grung. These young grungs have 1-1 Hit Dice but otherwise have the same abilities as adults. They reach full maturity in another six months.",
					"Grung tribes are matriarchal. War chiefs are all female, and the tribal chieftain is the strongest fighter among the war chiefs. Rising through the ranks is by duels to the death, with the victor getting the title. Each tribe also has a single female shaman of up to 3rd level. Her spheres are All, Animal, Combat, Healing (reversed spells only), and Plant.",
					"ECOLOGY",
					"Grung eat swamp-dwelling mammals, such as rats, unwary travelers, even other grung. They have few natural predators due to the toxicity of their flesh. Giant poisonous snakes are usually immune to grung poison and actively hunt grung.",
					"The water around grung settlements is tainted by their poisonous secretions. Any non-grung drinking the water must roll a successful saving throw vs. poison (with a +3 bonus) or become nauseated for 2d4 rounds. Nauseated creatures fight with penalties of -1 to their attack rolls and +1 to their Armor Class.",
					"Grung poison is almost impossible to bottle (as any exposure to air causes it to decompose in ten rounds)."

					"DESCRIPTION",
					"The gynosphinx is the female counterpart of the androsphinx, having a winged lion's body and human-like facial features. Gynosphinxes are not nearly as powerful as androsphinxes, but they are much more knowledgeable, clever, and wise. Gynosphinxes speak all sphinx languages as well as common.",
					"HABITAT / SOCIETY",
					"Gynosphinxes are solitary by nature, but not by choice. They spend most of their lives avoiding the advances of criosphinxes (which they detest) and hieracosphinxes (which they fear), and searching high and low for an androsphinx.",
					"Gynosphinxes are intelligent enough to actively seek out ruins and mystical places, like forgotten temples and such, which they immediately occupy. Using their many spells to learn as much as possible about the setting, they then wait for the next group of travelers, pilgrims, or adventurers to come by and hope that they've encountered an androsphinx in their travels or have spells or magical items that might be usable for just such a purpose.",
					"ECOLOGY",
					"Gynosphinxes own the dubious distinction of being the only female sphinx. A gynosphinx mated with an androsphinx will produce another androsphinx or gynosphinx (even chances for both). A gynosphinx mated with a criosphinx only produces another male criosphinx, while mating with a hieracosphinx produces similarly displeasing results.",
					"Fortunately, gynosphinxes are much smarter than all of their counterparts and can avoid otherwise compromising situations through trickery and outright deceit. Unfortunately, they are among the slowest of the sphinxes when flying or running, and the lustful criosphinx and vicious hieracosphinx rarely give up the chase once a gynosphinx has been located."
