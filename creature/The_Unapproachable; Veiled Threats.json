Rather intelligent for spiders, they often spend time assessing prey. Then they creep forward, attach their silk safety-line and leap onto their victim to deliver a paralyzing bite."

While hanging above, they hold the net downward, parallel to the ground using their long front legs. They wait and ensnare passing prey, then wrap the woolly fibers around them to make escape nearly impossible. For an extra advantage, gladiator spiders have very large eyes that give them a wide field of vision and better night vision than cats or owls."

Yet, with unusually poor eye-sight (even for a spider) and only six eyes instead of the usual eight, they need other ways to locate prey. So, they hunt at night, use their powerful sense of 'hearing' and often use their long front legs as feelers. As a result, they are slow, but stealthy hunters. This usually gives them the chance to spit several times if their prey is larger or difficult to subdue."
