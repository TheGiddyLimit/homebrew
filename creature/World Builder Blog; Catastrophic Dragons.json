The entrance to these lairs are often hidden by mud storms which form on the ocean floor around the lair, driven by the harsh wind magic of the dragon.",
							"These lairs are twisting tunnels flooded with seawater, so traveling through one requires swimming. Some chambers might have areas where a non-water breathing creature could take a breath or even get out and walk around, but even rooms that aren't fully submerged are still salty and wet.",
							"Typhoon dragons often take on intruders in chambers with craggy peaks sticking above the surface of the water. This allows the typhoon dragon to dive into the waves to make melee attacks, or fight above them, using its aura to the fullest advantage. It also makes life difficult for any non-aquatic enemies who enter the lair, since they have very few places to stand."
