Nagpas are, or rather were, human or half-elven mages cursed with this disfigurement and set loose to wander the length and breadth of Mystara. Certain Immortals inflict this curse upon especially selfish mages who disdain the company of others. The curse cannot be removed by any spell less powerful than a {@link wish}.",
					"As part of their curse, nagpas instinctively know if they are being talked about anywhere within a 100-mile radius. They can track such gossipers as long as the speakers remain in range.",
					"A nagpa's ears suffer a burning sensation that grows hotter as the nagpa gets closer to the individual who spoke about the race. Items such as amulets of nondetection protect speakers from the cursed detection of the nagpas. So great is the nagpas' shame that they are determined that none should ever know their horrible secret. When a speaker is found, he or she is immediately killed by the nagpa. It then wanders away, consumed with feelings of guilt, remorse, relief, and joy.",
					"ECOLOGY",
					"These cursed creatures cannot eat, sleep, laugh, reproduce, or take part in any other activity enjoyed by living humans. Some evil mages use the skin of nagpas as parchment for scrolls of certain powerful necromantic spells."

It brings its prey down with flesh-corroding exhalations that dissolve all but the fatty brain, an essential component of its diet. An adult reaches 10 feet in diameter, but its wormlike body grows longer throughout its existence - reaching lengths in excess of 120 feet.",

					"Its mauve coloration has caused some to mistake neothelids for {@creature purple worm|AGGMM3}s at a distance; thankfully, both creatures are rare.",
					"A neothelid senses its world via innate telepathy with a radius of 360 feet. Within this radius, the neothelid is aware of all non-psionically shielded sentient beings and can communicate with intelligent creature - via telepathy - even through solid rock.",

					"In the remarkably rare event that mind flayer tadpoles develop in the absence of illithid adults, a small number survive long enough on their own to develop into neothelids. These creatures indiscriminately hunt any illithids they may chance upon. Illithids, in turn, respond to the news of neothelid emergence with utter disgust, and they quickly organize hunting parties to exterminate the abominations.",

					"An illithid tadpole that fails to undergo ceremorphosis gradually grows into a neothelid \u2014 assuming it survives its first 100 years as a mindless slug eking out a living on subterranean vermin. Once a tadpole is powerful enough to be called a neothelid (triggered by the eating of its first sentient brain), it becomes a terrible danger, hunting all other living creatures (including illithids) wih an insatiable, insane hunger.",
					"Unlike some other large predators of the underdark neothelids an unable to burrow through solid rock, forcing them to hunt naturally or previously delved tunnels and caverns. When a local subterrineai ecosystem is exhausted, neothelids may move to \"greener\" tunnels via their psychoportive abilities.",

					"Night hags inhabit the Gray Waste and, practically speaking, rule it. They are wretched females with hideous dark blue-violet skin, jet black hair, and glowing red eyes; long, wicked claws on their hands and feet; and foul rotting fangs protruding from their dry, festering lips. Night hags speak multiple languages, preferring those that help them in their dealings with evil beings.",
					"HABITAT / SOCIETY",
					"Night hags rule the Waste by default. They round up and herd larvae for barter with fiends of all types. Tanar'ri and baatezu alike require larvae for their quasits and imps, and some liches use larvae to maintain their undead condition.",
					"Night hags are said to see the multiverse as a place of eternal conflict. They believe it is unwise to form permanent alliances, for those who rule today are apt to be slaves tomorrow. Nevertheless, their keen minds and perfect memories cause many to seek the hags for wisdom and counsel.",
					"Night hags are always willing to trade for knowledge, magical items, and spirits. However, if those trading with them do not match or exceed the hags in strength, the hags later track them down and make them into larvae.",
					"Some lords of the Lower Planes take night hags for wives. From such unions are only born more night hags, equal to others of their race and not partaking of the characteristics of their sire. It is said that occasionally hags travel to other planes, assume the forms of beautiful women, and become wives of powerful wizards, that they might thereby gain further secrets of the universe.",
					"Hags have no particular hatred for any one race or type of beings, even their own. Their inability to form permanent alliances is probably the only thing that has kept them from wielding greater power on the Lower Planes.",
					"Likewise, the only thing that keeps a hag's cruelty in check is her burning desire to know all things. Certain human colleges were founded by night hags, and some research projects \u2014 even those carried out by the most moral of wizards \u2014 have been ultimately found to be financed by hag gold.",
					"Very few beings have ever outwitted a hag. In such cases the hag spends years coming up with an intricate plot to outtrick the trickster. Night hags do remember any kindness shown to them, as well, but they appear less motivated to repay it.",
					"ECOLOGY",
					"Night hags are the only lower-planar inhabitants that actually seek out humans and kill them for their spirits. They destroy any life form they can overpower. Night hags are mercilessly wicked.",
					"Night hags carry a special periapt called a charm of blackness. Created by hags deep in the pits of the Waste, they instantly cure any disease the possessor contracts and gives a +2 bonus to all saving throws. If a good creature gains a charm, it functions but shatters after ten uses. Night hags lose their ability to become ethereal without their periapt, but the ability does not transfer to others. Hags go to great pains to retrieve lost periapts; it takes one month and 100 larvae to create another.",

I flew my broom to it, and was immediately struck hy the relative quiet of the place, as opposed to the incessant cries of the Hordlings.

Then I realized that it was the skulls themselves making the noise. Some vitality, some evil force remained in them.",

He came at a canter, as opposed to the great gallop in which they normally appear. He neighed once very loudly, and every skull on the Hill of Bone answered him in a deafening call. Then he lay down and died, almost instantly.",

But the goblins' pantheon included a trickster deity who was determined to get the last laugh. Although its essence was shattered by Maglubiyet, this trickster god survives in splintered form as a possessing spirit that arises when goblinoids form a host, causing disorder in the ranks unless it is appeased. Goblins have no name for this deity and dare not give it one, lest Maglubiyet use its name to ensnare and crush it as he did their other deities. They call the possessing spirit, and the goblin possessed by it, a nilbog (\"goblin\" spelled backward), and they revel in the fear that a nilbog sows among the ranks of the bugbears and hobgoblins in the host."

					"DESCRIPTION",
					"Ogres are big, ugly, greedy humanoids that live by ambushes, raids, and theft. Ill-tempered and nasty, these monsters are often found serving as mercenaries in the ranks of {@creature orc|AGGMM3} tribes, evil clerics, or {@creature gnoll|AGGMM2}s. They mingle freely with {@creature giant|AGGMM2}s and {@creature troll|AGGMM4}s.",
					"Adult ogres stand 9 to 10 feet tall and weigh 300 to 350 pounds. Their skin colors range from a dead yellow to a dull black-brown, and (rarely) a sickly violet. Their warty bumps are often of a different color \u2014 or at least darker than their hides. Their eyes are purple with white pupils. Teeth and talons are orange or black. Ogres have long, greasy hair of blackish-blue to dull dark green. Their odor is repellent, reminiscent of curdled milk. Dressing in poorly cured furs and animal hides, they care for their weapons and armor only reasonably well. It is common for ogres to speak orc, troll, stone giant, and gnoll, as well as their own guttural language. A typical ogre's life span is 90 years.",
					"HABITAT / SOCIETY",
					"Ogre tribes are found anywhere, from deep caverns to mountaintops. Tribes have {@dice 1d6+20} males, {@dice 2d6} females, and {@dice 2d4} young. Shamans, if present, will be of 3rd level. Ogres live by raiding and scavenging and they will eat anything.",
					"Their fondness for elf, dwarf, and halfling flesh means that there is only a 10% chance that these will be found as slaves or prisoners. There is a 30% chance that an ogre lair will include 2d4 slaves. Captured prisoners are always kept as slaves (25%) or food (75%). Extremely avaricious, ogres squabble over treasure and cannot be trusted, even by their own kind.",
					"ECOLOGY",
					"Ogres consistently plague mankind, lusting for gold, gems, and jewelry as well as human flesh. They are evil-natured creatures that join with other monsters to prey on the weak and favor overwhelming odds to a fair fight. Ogres make no crafts nor labor.",
					"Ogre is employed as material component to empower the following spells: {@spell Mage Hand}"

					"{@link ORC's TACTICS (read the article)|https://angrygolem-games.com/monster-tactics-fight-like-a-orc/}",
					"DESCRIPTION",
					"Orcs are a species of aggressive mammalian carnivores that band together in tribes and survive by hunting and raiding. Orcs believe that in order to survive they must expand their territory, and so they are constantly involved in wars against many enemies: humans, elves, dwarves, {@creature goblin|AGGMM}s, and other orc tribes.",
					"Orcs vary widely in appearance, as they frequently crossbreed with other species. In general, they resemble primitive humans with grey-green skin covered with coarse hair. Orcs have a slightly stooped posture, a low jutting forehead, and a snout instead of a nose, though comparisons between this facial feature and those of pigs are exaggerated and perhaps unfair.",
					"Orcs have well-developed canine teeth for eating meat and short pointed ears that resemble those of a wolf. Orcish snouts and ears have a slightly pink tinge. Their eyes are human, with a reddish tint that sometimes makes them appear to glow red when they reflect dim light sources in near darkness. This is actually part of their optical system, a pigment which gives them infravision.",
					"Male orcs are about 5 to 6 feet tall. Females average 6 inches shorter than males. Orcs prefer to wear colors that most humans think unpleasant: blood red, rust red, mustard yellow, yellow green, moss green, greenish purple, and blackish brown. Their armor is unattractive besides \u2014 dirty and often a bit rusty. Orcs speak Orcish, a language derived from older human and elvish languages.",
					"There is no common standard of Orcish, so the language has many dialects which vary from tribe to tribe. Orcs have also learned to speak local common tongues, but are not comfortable with them. Some orcs have a limited vocabulary in goblin, hobgoblin, and ogre dialects.",
					"HABITAT / SOCIETY",
					"For {@b every three orcs} encountered, there will be a {@b leader} and three {@b assistants}. These orcs will have 22 hit points each, being the meanest and strongest in the group.",
					"If {@b 150 orcs or more} are encountered there will be the following additional figures with the band: one {@b subchief} and {@dice 3d6} {@b guards}, each with Armor Class 14, 30 hit points, and 18 Strength. They fight as monsters of 2 Hit Dice.",
					"For {@b every 100 orcs} encountered, there will be either a {@b shaman} (maximum 5th level cleric) or a {@b witch-doctor} (maximum 4th-level warlock).",
					"If the orcs are not in their lair, there is a 20% chance they will be escorting a train of {@dice 1d6} carts and {@dice 1d6 x 10} slave bearers bringing supplies, loot, or ransom and tribute to their orc chief or a stronger orc tribe.",
					"The total value of the goods carried by all of the carts will vary between 10d100 silver pieces, and each slave bearer will bear goods valued between 5d6 silver pieces.",
					"If the orcs are escorting a treasure train, double the number of {@b leaders} and {@b assistants} and add {@dice 10} orcs for each cart in the train; one {@b subchief} with {@dice 5d6} {@b guards} will always be in charge.",
					"Orc lairs are underground 75% of the time, in a wilderness village 25% of the time. Orc communities range from small forts with 1d4 x 100 orcs to mining communities with 5d4 x 100 orcs to huge cities (partially underground and partially above ground) with 2d10 x 1,000 orcs.",
					"There will always be additional orcs when the encounter is in a creature's lair: a {@b chief} and {@dice 5d6} {@b bodyguards} (AC 14, 23 hit points, attack as monsters with 3 Hit Dice and Strength 20).",
					"If the lair is underground, there is a 50% chance that {@dice 1d4+1} ogres per 200 orcs will be living with them. Most lairs above ground are rude villages of wooden huts protected by a ditch, log rampart and log palisade, or more advanced constructions built by other races.",
					"The village will have 1d4 watch towers and a single gate. There will be one ballista and one catapult for every 100 adult male orcs.",
					"Orcs are aggressive. They believe other species are inferior to them and that bullying and slavery is part of the natural order. They will cooperate with other species but are not dependable: as slaves, they will rebel against all but the most powerful masters; as allies they are quick to take offense and break agreements.",
					"Orcs believe that battle is the ideal challenge, but some leaders are pragmatic enough to recognize the value of peace, which they exact at a high price. If great patience and care are used, orc tribes can be effective trading partners and military allies.",
					"Orcs value territory above all else; battle experience, wealth, and number of offspring are other major sources of pride. Orcs are patriarchal; women are fit only to bear children and nurse them. Orcs have a reputation for cruelty that is deserved, but humans are just as capable of evil as orcs. Orcs have marriage customs, but orc males are not noted for their faithfulness.",
					"Orcs worship many deities (some who have different names among different tribes); the chief deity is usually a giant, one-eyed orc. Orcish religion is extremely hateful toward other species and urges violence and warfare. Orc shamans have been noted for their ambition, and many tribes have suffered because of political infighting between warriors and priests.",
					"ECOLOGY",
					"Orcs have an average lifespan of 40 years. They have a gestation period of 10 months and produce two to three offspring per birth. Infant mortality is high. Orcs are carnivores, but prefer game meats or livestock to demihumans and humanoids.",
					"It is said that orcs have no natural enemies, but they work hard to make up for this lack. Orc tribes have fearsome names such as Vile Rune, Bloody Head, Broken Bone, Evil Eye, and Dripping Blade.",
					"Orcs are skilled miners and excellent weaponsmiths.",
					"Orcs are employed as material component to empower the following spells:{@spell Resistance}"

Females particularly attracted to Luthic grow long nails and lacquer them, learning to use these claws as weapons much as Luthic uses her own. Orc females devoted to Luthic are in charge of fortifying and maintaining an orc stronghold. They help to guarantee the survival of the tribe, and most are skilled in the healing arts. The most powerful among Luthic's disciples are the claws of Luthic, which can use the Cave Mother's magic to heal, protect, and curse."

					"They feed on dung and wastes from other dungeon creatures (gulguthra means \"dung eaters\") but also enjoy an occasional snack of fresh meat.",
					"Otyughs have huge, bloated bodies covered with a rock-like skin that is brownish gray in color, which is in turn covered with dung. They stand on three thick legs that give them slow ground movement but enable them to pivot quickly.",
					"They have three eyes on a leaf-like stalk that moves quickly from side to side, enabling them to scan a large area. The eye stalk is also a receiver/transmitter for their telepathic abilities. Otyughs have a huge mouth with very sharp teeth in the center of their mass.",
					"They also have two tentacles with leaf-like ridges that they use to smash and grapple their opponents. The tentacles are covered with rough thorn-like projections. Neo-otyughs have smaller mouths than otyughs.",
					"Otyughs and neo-otyughs speak their own language, much of which is non-verbal (movements of eye stalk and tentacles, or emission of certain smells); they also have limited telepathy that enable them to communicate with other creatures. Otyughs reek of dung and decay.",
					"HABITAT / SOCIETY",
					"All gulguthra have limited telepathic ability. An otyugh can communicate with creatures up to 120 feet away, while a neo-otyugh can communicate with creatures as distant as 240 feet.",
					"Communication is usually limited to simple feelings and emotions such as hunger, temperature conditions and associated discomforts, its dislike of bright lights, and imminent death for its prey.",
					"Otyughs and neo-otyughs live in ruins and dungeons. They make deals with other dungeon denizens, agreeing not to attack them in exchange for their dung and body wastes, which they then devour.",
					"To keep the supply of waste coming (and to get fresh meat) they will agree to help defend their home against intruders, which includes many adventurers. Otyughs may be persuaded not to attack creatures in exchange for promises of friendship and food.",
					"{@creature Neo-otyugh|AGGMM3}s are less trusting (and more vicious), and usually attack intruders on sight. An otyugh's dungeon allies will sometimes ask it to guard treasure for them. Most gulguthra live alone; 10% of the time, during mating season, two gulguthra can found in its lair.",
					"ECOLOGY",
					"Otyughs and {@creature neo-otyugh|AGGMM3}s live underground in heaps of offal and refuse. They hate bright sunlight, preferring the comfortable darkness of dungeons.",
					"They mate each year for one month, with one offspring produced. It takes the newborn four months to mature (immature gulguthra have 3-5 HD, damage",
					"{@dice 1d6} (tentacle), {@dice 2d6} (bite).",
					"Otyughs are so disgusting that no alchemist or wizard would want to touch their components, so the corpses of the gulguthra have no known use or value."

					"Owls are a family of nocturnal birds of prey. There are many different species and varieties are found in every clime but owls are most common in temperate and subarctic climates. Owls are predators that hunt rodents, small lizards, and insects, attacking humanoids only when frightened (or magically commanded). Some cultures view owls as symbols of wisdom; others as symbols of imminent death.",
					"Owls range in size from the pygmy owl, which is 6 inches long, to the great horned owl which is 2 feet long and has a 5-foot wingspread. The owl statistics listed above are for larger species. Most owls are noted for their heart-shaped faces and huge eyes (also notable for a nictitating membrane or inner eyelid). Some owls have swept-back ears that look like horns. Their cries range from gentle hoots to ear-piercing screeches.",
					"COMBAT",
					"Owls have double normal darkvisionand fly in total silence, so they will surprise their prey more often. Owls cannot be surprised during hours of dusk and darkness (sunset to sunrise). During daylight hours, their eyesight is worse than that of a human, so owls can be surprised more easily. Owls attack with their sharp talons and hooked beak. If they swoop from a height of 50 feet or greater, each attack inflicts double damage.",
					"HABITAT / SOCIETY",
					"Owls live in virtually every part of the world. Most owls live in tree hollows, but the burrowing owl lives in holes made by prairie dogs. Owls try to find the lairs of other birds and drive them away. Some daylight birds (crows, ravens) that are preyed upon by owls flock to attack them during the day; because of this, hunters sometimes use owls as decoys. Owls either live in solitude or in pairs. They can be domesticated somewhat if taken young, but cannot be trained to hunt.",
					"ECOLOGY",
					"Owls prey on rodents, toads, frogs, insects, and daylight birds. No creatures are known to prey on owls other than monsters such as wyverns that will attack most flying creatures."

The beaks of these creatures are yellow to ivory and their terrifying eyes are red-rimmed. Owlbears speak their own language, which consists of very loud screeches of varying length and pitch.",
					"COMBAT",
					"The owlbear attacks prey on sight, always fighting to the death. It attacks with its claws and snapping beak.",
					"The owlbear can also use its beak attack on victims caught in its grasp, but cannot use its claws.",
					"HABITAT / SOCIETY",
					"Owlbears inhabit the depths of tangled forests in temperate climes, as well as subterranean labyrinths, living in caves or hollow stumps. Owlbears live in mated pairs; the male is slightly larger and heavier than the female.",
					"If encountered in their lair there is a 25% chance that there will be 1-6 eggs (20%) or young (80%) in addition to the adults. The offspring will be 40% to 70% grown and fight as creatures with three or four Hit Dice, depending on their growth.",
					"They have hit points based on their adjusted Hit Dice. Immature offspring inflict 1d4 (claws) and 1d8 (beak) points of damage with their attacks.",
					"An owlbear pair claims a territory of one or two square miles and will vigorously defend this territory against all intruders.",
					"An owlbear's main weakness is also its greatest strength \u2014 its ferocity. Because owlbears are so bad-tempered, they stop at nothing to kill a target. It is not difficult to trick an owlbear into hurling itself off a cliff or into a trap, provided you can find one.",
					"ECOLOGY",
					"Owlbears have a lifespan of 20 years. They are warm-blooded mammals, but lay eggs. They prey on anything, from rabbits to bears, to trolls, to snakes and reptiles.",
					"Owlbears prefer temperate climates, but some thrive in subarctic environments. As a hybrid of two animals, one diurnal and the other nocturnal, they have an unusual active time, waking at noon, hunting animals active during the day, then hunting nocturnal creatures before going to sleep at midnight.",
					"Owlbears are active in the summer months and hibernate during the cold season. There are rumors of white arctic owlbears, a cross between arctic owls and polar bears, but no specimens have ever been captured.",
					"An owlbear does not actively seek treasure but the remains of victims may be found buried in shallow holes around an owlbear lair. Owlbear eggs are worth 2,000 silver pieces and hatchlings are worth 5,000 silver pieces on the open market.",
					"These are typically bought by wizards; while they are impossible to domesticate, they make formidable guardians and wizards sometimes place them in locations of strategic importance (it has been said that an owlbear is a less subtle version of a \"keep out\" sign). Owlbears in dungeons and ruins almost always have been placed there by someone.+",

					"High above the mountains and rocky hills of most lands flies a sharp-eyed monster known as the peryton. Intelligent, patient, and malevolent, it watches and waits for prey \u2014 to pluck their hearts out.",
					"The peryton resembles a giant, dark green eagle, except that its head is that of a blue-black stag, its horns glitter as ebon as obsidian, its eyes glow a dull red-orange. The chest feathers of a male peryton are light blue; those of the female are drab brown. Perytons normally cast the shadow of an adult human being, rather than those of their own form.",
					"Perytons do not adorn themselves with trinkets, nor arm themselves with weapons. Their language is a collection of roars and screeches, and often sounds as if a peryton were either injured or enraged. Some creatures, with a keen sense of smell, claim that a peryton smells like a human, while others are filled with an irrational fear upon catching first scent.",
					"COMBAT",
					"A peryton has only a secondary interest in prey as food. Its main interest in humanoids creatures is the heart of its prey.",
					"It attacks with its sharp horns, since its claws are too weak to use in melee. When a peryton chooses a target for combat, it locks itself into a duel that nearly always ends in either the peryton's death or that of its target. A peryton will never switch targets during combat, no matter the tactical situation. On rare occasions, the creature can be driven off, but it will continue to stalk its prey, and return at a later time.",
					"Some perytons choose to swoop at a target. In this form of attack, the peryton climbs several hundred feet in the air and then plunges at the target, dropping with awesome speed. This is an extreme maneuver that the peryton will only attempt if combat is going poorly, or if it believes it has a chance to achieve total surprise.",
					"Another common tactic is for the peryton to seize a Medium target and then lift off with the prey in its talons. The peryton climbs so rapidly that most targets do not react until they are at least 100 feet in the air and facing a plummet if they manage to escape the peryton's grasp.",
					"HABITAT / SOCIETY",
					"Perytons roost in caves high atop cliffs or on mountain peaks. They settle in nests of 2d4 creatures, each nest independent of any other, and no two nests being within several miles of one another, except for unusual circumstances \u2014 like a dwarven community in the mountains providing them with plentiful prey.",
					"Perytons sometimes take humans and humanoid creatures alive and hold them captive in their nests until they are needed as food (90% likely for nonhumans, 25% the case for humans) or for reproduction. Because of this, the peryton nests may have treasure scattered about, as well as 1d4 unhatched eggs.",
					"ECOLOGY",
					"The peryton is a predator, with no natural enemies (few could pierce its magically resistant skin). Humanoids, and especially humans, are its selected prey. A female peryton requires a fresh, beating heart to reproduce, and human hearts are the preferred variety. Once a peryton has eaten a heart, its shadow changes into that of its normal form and the creature becomes fertile for 3d6 hours. Unhatched peryton eggs can be sold for 10d12 gp apiece."

					"It is the lack of something that move and motivate characters, not the abundance of it",
					"DESCRIPTION",
					"Flumph resemble aerial jellyfish. These odd creatures are round and almost flat, perhaps the or four inches thick in the center, tapering to one or two inches near the edge. The body is mostly hollow, much like a large cushion. A round orifices is in the center of the upper surface, flanked by two eyestalks, each about six inches long. Several short tentacles hang from the creature's underside, concealing a mass of small spikes. The tentacles closest to the flumph's rim can be used for fine manipulation of small objects. A common flumph is pure white in color; a monastic flumph is generally a pale yellow or green, with darker tentacles.",
					"A flumph flies by taking in air through the hole on its upper surface, and expelling it through several small holes on its underside. The creature also has several small apertures along its equator, for use in maneuvering. It usually hovers about four to six inches above the ground. Keeping its body aloft does not require great amounts of air. It creates a gentle breeze, and a slight whistling sound can be heard in a quiet area.",
					"Common flumphs cannot communicate vocally, but have a unique sign language that makes use of their tentacles and eyestalks. Some monastic flumphs, perhaps 10%, can speak and understand common or another language.",
					"COMBAT",
					"The flumph survives by hunting small creatures, such as rats, lizards, frogs, and the like. The flumph hovers along just above the ground, or hangs motionless in reeds or similar concealment. When it finds a small creature, it rises a foot or two, then drops onto its prey, its spikes inflicting 1d4 +2 points of piercing damage on a successful attack.",
					"In addition, the flumphs tentacles secrete digestive acids into the wounds; the acid causes an additional 1d4 points of acid damage each round. Once the prey is dead, the flumph settles on it and absorbs nutrients through its tentacles. Flumphs often need to pursue their healthier prey for a short distance before the victim dies. The acid can be washed away by complete immersion in a fast-moving stream, by actively washing the acid away (full round action) with a {@spell Create or Destroy Water|PHB|Create Water} spell (simple immersion or rinsing will not work) or by a {@spell Lesser Restoration} cast on the target.",
					"If threatened by a larger creature, the flumph usually attempts to drive it away by squirting a foul-smelling liquid from an orifice on its equator, in the front. If this method of repulsion fails, the flumph can rise to a height of 10 feet and drop onto an opponent, as if hunting.",
					"HABITAT / SOCIETY",
					"The common flumph is a nomadic hunter, intelligent, good-aligned, and peaceful. A flumph reproduces about every two years by budding, producing 1d8 tiny flumphs on its underside. These become independent after about three months when they reach two inches in diameter. They grow to adult size within a month, and live for 20 years.",
					"ECOLOGY",
					"Flumphs are predators low on the food chain, feeding on smaller creatures and clearing their area of vermin. Flumph flesh has a foul taste, and they are generally considered unpalatable, though ogres and some goblinoids will eat them.",
					"Monastic Flumphs",
					"The seldom-seen monastic flumphs are more advanced creatures that can cast spells as if they were clerics of levels equal to their Hit Dice. They gather in cloisters to share knowledge and to worship deities unknown to humanoids. A cloister is usually in a large cavern or (in swamps and grasslands) a large, nest-like bower constructed of grass and mud. The inside of a cloister is decorated with fine, colorful paintings, made by flumphs dabbing natural pigments with their tentacles. The paintings are usually abstract, showing spirals and other curved lines, though some are vaguely representational of flumphs engaged in hunting.",
					"Each cloister is led by an {@creature abbot flumph|AGGMM}.",
					"The abbot is aided by one {@creature prior flumph|AGGMM3} per six flumphs in the cloister.",
					"The remainder of the flumphs are {@creature monks flumph|AGGMM2}.",
					"On occasion, a small group of common flumphs can be found near a cloister, bringing food as an offering in return for healing or guidance."

					"DESCRIPTION",
					"Pseudodragons are a species of small flying lizard that inhabits heavily forested wilderness areas. These playful, benign creatures have magical powers that they can share with others, so they are often sought as companions.",
					"Pseudodragons resemble miniature red dragons. They have fine scales and sharp horns and teeth. A pseudodragon's coloration is red-brown as opposed to the deep red of red dragons. Its tail is about 2 feet long (longer than the pseudodragon itself), barbed, and very flexible.",
					"Pseudodragons communicate via a limited form of telepathy. If one elects to take a human companion, it can transmit what it sees and hears at a distance of up to 240 yards. Pseudodragons can vocalize animal noises such as a rasping purr (pleasure), a hiss (unpleasant surprise), a chirp (desire), or a growl (anger).",
					"HABITAT / SOCIETY",
					"These forest-dwelling creatures place their lairs in the hollows of great trees or in large caves. A pseudodragon will very rarely take a human or demihuman as its companion. Some view these pseudodragons as the human's pet; the pseudodragon will be sure to correct this misunderstanding. There are two ways to become a pseudodragon's companion; one is to use magic to summon it (a find familiar spell). Another way is to find the pseudodragon on an adventure and pursuade it to become a companion. The pseudodragon that searches for companionship will stalk a candidate silently for days, reading his thoughts via telepathy, judging his deeds to be good or evil. If the candidate is found to be good, the pseudodragon will present itself to the human as a traveling companion and observe the human's reaction. If the human seems overjoyed and promises to take very good care of it, the pseudodragon will accept. If not, it will fly away.",
					"The personality of a pseudodragon has been described by some as catlike. A pseudodragon is willing to serve, provided that it is well-fed, groomed, and receives lots of attention.",
					"At times a pseudodragon seems arrogant, demanding, and less than willing to help. In order to gain its full cooperation, the companion must pamper the pseudodragon and make it feel as though it were the most important thing in his life. If the pseudodragon is mistreated or insulted it will leave, or worse, play pranks when least expected. Pseudodragons particularly dislike cruelty and will not serve cruel masters.",
					"ECOLOGY",
					"Pseudodragons are omnivorous but prefer to eat meat. Their diet consists chiefly of rodents and small birds with occasional leaves, fruits, and berries. In the wild, pseudodragons live solitary lives, protecting small personal hoards in their nests. They gather to mate once per year, in early spring, when gatherings of dozens of pseudodragons are not uncommon. After mating, males and females separate; females lay speckled brown eggs in clutches of four to six which hatch in mid-summer; females raise the young by themselves. Pseudodragons hibernate in winter; the young leave the nest in spring to mate.",
					"Pseudodragons have a lifespan of 10-15 years. Like dragons, they are attracted to bright shiny objects. Pseudodragon eggs can be resold for up to 10,000 gold pieces while a hatchling is worth as much as 20,000 gold pieces"

The worm is sensitive to minute vibrations in the earth, and can sense prey at a range of 60 feet. Adult purple worms as large as 8-9 feet in diameter and 140-150 feet long have been reliably reported.",
					"The purple worm is solitary and seeks a companion only to mate. The moment a new worm hatches, it burrows into the ground, never to be seen by its siblings again. As the worm tunnels, it consumes vast amounts of material that are excreted when it returns to its lair. Among the discharged substances are precious metals and gems.",
					"The mottled worm is an aquatic variety of the purple worm. It inhabits shallow bottom muck, but it often surfaces to search for prey. Otherwise, it is the same as a purple worm.",
					"The thunderherder is desert variety of the purple worm; they travel in herds of 10-100, several feet under the sands. They feed on small creatures in the sand, their bodies ejecting sand. They are 3-5 feet in diameter and 5-10 feet long, and have 7 Hit Dice. Their mouths are unable to cause damage, but their passage beneath an area causes an earthquake-like effect."

					"Rakshasa society is led by a rajah or maharajah, whose commands are to be obeyed without question.",

					"DESCRIPTION",
					"Ravens and crows are large, black birds known primarily as one of nature's primary scavengers. They are often mistaken as bad omens by superstitious farmers and peasants. In fact, popular mythology supports these views, as many religions speak often of the \"evil black\" raven and the \"trickster\" crow.",
					"Ravens and crows have their own limited language. Certain ravens, including some huge and most giant specimens, can speak as many as 100 words of the common tongue and can communicate in meaningful phrases. For this and other reasons (like their usefulness as garbage disposals, guardians, and vermin hunters), most ravens and crows make very fine house and yard pets.",
					"COMBAT",
					"Because of the use of scouts within the flock of birds (see below), ravens and crows cannot be surprised during daylight conditions. Ravens and crows attack with both their strong daws and their long, sharp beaks. However, the claws are used mostly for balance and often to obscure the sight of the victim, so only the beak causes actual physical damage. Therefore, ravens and crows employ a grab and peck approach to combat.",
					"Because of their intelligence, these birds are likely to attack an opponent's eye. In other words, whenever an attack roll indicates a natural 20, the target must make a successful DC 12 dexterity saving throw, failure results in the loss of that organ.",
					"Ravens and crows are not adverse to teaming up against a single foe, and the chance of blinding a potential victim increases dramatically as the number of birds attacking increases.",
					"HABITAT / SOCIETY",
					"Ravens and crows are found from cold-temperate to tropical climes. All birds of this type travel in flocks. Any that are encountered alone are actually scouts. As soon as any approaching creature that could threaten the flock is seen or detected, the scouts give warning cries, screen themselvs, and maintain a safe distance while keeping track of the creatures and reporting events to the flock by means of raucous calls. In any case, all ravens and crows are fiercely loyal to the few friends they make in a lifetime.",
					"ECOLOGY",
					"Ravens and crows are principally scavengers, but, being omnivorous, they also raid crops, nests, or unattended caches of food. Tales of giant ravens spiriting off babes from their cribs are more iiely frightening myths than proven fact, but this feat is possible nonetheless.",
					"All birds of this sort love objects that glitter and shine. Thus they are 25% likely to have several small metal objects, gems, trinkets and the like in their nests. In general, the larger the raven (or crow) and the greater the size of the flock, the more valuable and wondrous the small treasures found within.",
					"In fact, some of these birds have been trained to recover such objects with startling results. More than a few simple bird trainers have acquired enough minor magical rings and precious stones to retire in wealth and comfort. Naturally, the specific training methods employed are closely guarded secrets."

					"DESCRIPTION",
					"Sharks are large, finned, voracious carnivores that inhabit all known oceans and seas. They are perhaps the most aggressive eating machines found in the murky deeps.",
					"COMBAT",
					"Sharks sense pressure changes underwater, most often caused by noises from other creatures. Thrashing about in the water always attracts sharks, since usually only wounded fish behave like that. Sharks can sense these motions from up to a mile away and once one shark discovers prey, more are soon to follow. Sharks also attack mercilessly at the scent of blood, which they can likewise detect at distances of a mile or more.",
					"When a number of sharks gather around a bleeding victim, the scent of the blood and the thrill of the kill send all sharks into a feeding frenzy. Nothing escapes from such an attack, not even some sharks. Sharks eat anything living, even each other, during a feeding frenzy. Since sharks move up, take a bite of flesh, and retreat very quickly, up to four large-sized sharks can attack a man-sized opponent in the water every round.",
					"HABITAT / SOCIETY",
					"Sharks are pure eating and killing machines, evolving quite naturally into superior predators, and then remaining unchanged for millions of years. They are primarily scavengers, preying on the sick and wounded, but attack fresh meat if tempted to do so. They are very territorial and solitary.",
					"The only friends the sharks have are the sahuagin, who appreciate the predators for their bloody, ruthless, and efficient natures. They often use sharks as guardians, mounts, sacrifices, and personal pets. The king of all sahuagin is rumored to possess a megalodon shark of largest size, which he apparently feeds quite often. Sahuagin priestesses offer all of their sacrifices to pure white great white sharks of largest size, that are often decorated in collars of gold and silver.",
					"Sahuagin are the only known race to have successfully trained sharks as mounts and the process is secret. What is known is that a shark and its rider can both attack the same enemy with startling agility, making the combination one of the most fearsome in the deeps. The harness used to mount a sahuagin warrior on the back of a shark is apparently made of a special kind of seaweed, unknown to those of the surface world.",
					"ECOLOGY",
					"Sharks have only two natural weaknesses. The first one is that their internal organs are only poorly protected by a thick, flexible layer of gristle instead of a hard skeleton. Some creatures, such as dolphins, take advantage of this by ramming sharks from the side. Because of their highly intelligent nature, dolphins are the only true enemies of sharks. They are the only known species that actively hunts down and kills these otherwise greatly feared and respected monsters.",
					"Sharks are also forced to continuously move through the water in order to force sufficient volumes of oxygen-rich water past their primitive gills. Therefore, a shark that is held immobile for {@dice 1d4+1} hours will die of suffocation."

					"DESCRIPTION",
					"Retrievers are living constructs, creatures of nightmare manufactured by the tanar'ri lords to act as their emissaries and enforcers. They are bound to obey their tanar'ri masters and relentlessly pursue their diabolical objectives until they've accomplished their master's commands or died in the attempt. This streak of loyalty and determination makes retrievers especially valuable to the Abyssal Lords. Retrievers are known by that name because they're commonly ordered to find enemies or misguided subordinates of the Abyssal Lord and bring them back to face the music.",
					"A retriever resembles a huge spider the size of an elephant, with a black, chitinous exoskeleton and six insectile eyes. The creature's four rearmost limbs actually carry most of its weight; its front four limbs end in cleaverlike blades that aren't used for walking.",
					"Despite the monster's bloated appearance and hideous bulk, it's frighteningly fast and nimble. The retriever can't speak, but it sometimes gives voice to insidious whisperings and clickings that can't quite be understood.",
					"HABITAT / SOCIETY",
					"Retrievers don't have an existence independent of their abyssal masters. It's extremely unusual to encounter one that isn't following some set of orders. When a retriever doesn't have orders to follow, it's probably waiting near the palace or fortress of its creator for a new set of instructions. Given the chance, a retriever'll look for ways to introduce acts of petty malice or cruelty into the execution of its instructions, but above all it exists to do what it's told.",
					"Since retrievers are the living extensions of the will of the Abyssal Lords, they can enter any other plane at will, and have free travel throughout the Abyss. Only the most powerful and daring tanar'ri interfere with a retriever that's engaged in the pursuit of its duty.",
					"ECOLOGY",
					"Retrievers are somewhat similar to {@creature golem|AGGMM2}s. Their bodies are shaped from the stuff of the Abyss by a powerful tanar'ri lord and imbued with a spirit of evil to animate them. Therefore, retrievers exist outside of nature and neither eat, sleep, nor reproduce. However, spells that affect living creatures (such as charm, sleep, or enfeeblement) affect a retriever normally.",
					"Not every Abyssal Lord has mastered the making of retrievers. It's thought that Demogorgon was the first tanar'ri to do so, modeling the retriever's design on the form of the bebilith, or \"creeper of the Abyss\". Graz'zt and Pazrael are known to have retrievers in their service too, but it's impossible to say if they made the creatures themselves or were given retrievers by Demogorgon in exchange for some service or bargain."

					"Revenants are vengeful spirits that have risen from the grave to destroy their killers. The revenant appears as a spectral, decayed version of its appearance at the time of its death. Its pallid skin is drawn tightly over its bones. The flesh is cold and clammy. The sunken eyes are dull and heavy-lidded but, when the revenant faces his intended victim, the eyes blaze with unnatural intensity. The revenant bears an aura of sadness, anger, and determination.",
					"HABITAT / SOCIETY",
					"Under exceptional circumstances, a character who has died a violent death may rise as a revenant from the grave to wreak vengeance on his killer(s). In order to make this transition, two requirements must be met. The dead character's Constitution must be 18 and either his Wisdom or Intelligence must be greater than 16. Also, the total of his six ability scores must be 90 or more. Even if these conditions are met, there is only a 5% chance that the dead character becomes a revenant. If both Intelligence and Wisdom are over 16, the chance increases to 10%. If Intelligence, Wisdom, and Constitution are all 18, the creature can shift at will into any freshly killed humanoid, if the revenant rolls a successful saving throw.",
					"If the character died a particularly violent death, it may be unable to reoccupy its original body. In this case, the spirit occupies any available, freshly-dead corpse. However, the revenant's killer and associates always see the revenant as the person they killed.",
					"The revenant retains all the abilities it possessed in its previous life and has at least the hit points and saving throws of an 8-Hit Die creature. Its alignment is neutral, regardless of its alignment in life. It can converse fluently in its original language, although the stiffness of its vocal cords deters it from speaking except under extreme circumstances, such as when casting a spell at its killer.",
					"The sole purpose of the revenant's brief existence is to wreak vengeance on its killer, together with anyone who may have aided in the murder. It stops at nothing to achieve its purpose and can locate its intended victim wherever he may be. Accomplices are also tracked down if they are in the company of the killer, but if they are elsewhere they are ignored until the killer is dealt with. If the associates of the killer are with him in a party, they are dealt with after the killer is dead.",
					"The revenant's body does decay, though at a slower rate than normal. Within three to six months, the corpse decomposes rapidly and the revenant's spirit returns to the plane from which it came. When the revenant has completed its mission, the body immediately disintegrates and its spirit finally rests in peace.",
					"A revenant does not attack innocents except in self-defense. If necessary, the revenant can use cunning to get to its prey.",
					"ECOLOGY",
					"Revenants give murder victims a chance to avenge their own murders. They pursue their goals alone without desire or need for allies. However, if the revenant faces a powerful foe able to destroy the revenant's new form, the revenant may decide to use adventurers as pawns in its quest."

					"Ropers have the same body temperature as their surroundings.",
					"COMBAT",
					"A roper can stand upright to resemble a stalagmite, lie on the ground to imitate a boulder, or even flatten itself to look like a lump on a cavern floor. They can change color a little, enough to blend into rocky backgrounds.",

					"Rutterkin are tanar'ri mutated by energies unknown. They are complete outcasts, not even cannon fodder in the Blood War.",
					"However, rutterkin do unwittingly serve the tanar'ri. Rutterkin so hate their position that they wander the Abyss in solitude. There, they never attack any tanar'ri save for least tanar'ri. However, they savagely attack non-tanar'ri they see. Although the rutterkin are usually far too weak to stop intruders, these pathetic creatures try to gate in reinforcements, thereby spreading the alarm.",
					"ECOLOGY",
					"The {@creature nalfeshnee|AGGMM3} might create the rutterkin directly from the life forces of evil but incompetent beings who come before them for judgment. Rutterkin more truly represent chaos than their kin, for they are bound to no cause, have no society, and serve no master. Even the {@creature chasme|AGGMM} ignore them.",
					"Ancient stories of the origin of the rutterkin say that many millennia ago, a race of humans in a distant corner of the Prime Material Plane experimented with plane and probability travel. These cerebral beings explored the Prime Material Plane and eventually expanded into the Inner and Outer Planes. When they discovered the Abyss, they were enslaved by the tanar'ri, who had never before encountered beings other than themselves. Originally, tanar'ri abuse changed the rutterkin into what they are, but now other types of creatures can become rutterkin as well."

It may be that the savant aboleth are correct in their view that the Blood Queen deliberately chooses few of her creatures to bless with the skills of the savant.",

					"HABITAT / SOCIETY",
					"Savant aboles are highly arrogant creatures. Cabals of savant aboleth organize and run aboleth society, playing the role of rulers and dominators from within their great cities. They rarely leave the city of their dwelling, sending ordinary aboleth out to do the dirty work of capturing slaves and the task of collecting food for the savants, while they brood long and deeply in their domains. Young savants born elsewhere leave their broods virtually as soon as they are capable of independence, believing themselves to be guided by the Blood Queen to the great cities of the aboleth deep in the Underdark. Sometimes, older savants will travel to a brood to take acquisition of a young aboleth which has latent savant gifts. This is one of the few occasions when savants leave their cities, but leave they sometimes must, for savant aboleth are infertile and do not produce young of their own.",
					"Savant abolish are always hungry for magical items and lore. They do not require spellbooks for their wizard spells; memorized spells are recalled automatically during periods of rest and sleep and do not need to be relearned from any independent source. Young savants may spend days or weeks in telepathic communion with their elders and betters, the older savants passing on their mastery of magical skills and their knowledge of dark, arcane secrets. Savant aboleth are always eager to devour spellcasters and magic-using creatures, the better to improve their own understanding of magic.",
					"Savant abodes have a complex symbolic glyph system they use for all written communication. Those who are of 7th or higher level in either the priest or wizard class can create magical glyph by psychokinetic force, one glyph per day. Casting time is two turns plus one turn per additional glyph element (see below), so this is not a likely potential combat action. The total number of glyph-elements a savant aboleth can maintain at any one time equals its Intelligence score.",

							"{@b Master glyphs}: (each of which counts as a three-element glyph for the purposes of the savant aboleth's glyph limit) have unique effects.",
							"{@b Complex master glyphs} : Finally, great savant-aboleth of exceptional mastery (18 or higher Wisdom and Intelligence, 10th level or above as both priests and wizards) can create {@i complex master glyphs} which add an extra element onto a master glyph (for example, a {@item glyph of enfeeblement|COMItems} which also does cold damage); these {@i complex master glyphs} can even include effects from different schools. {@i Complex master glyphs} still only count as three {@i glyphs} for the purpose of determining the limit on the number of {@i glyphs} the savant can maintain at any one time, but they require six turns to create."
						]
					},

Saving throws are permitted against the effects of all these glyphs, but saving throws against the effects of a {@i master glyph} are made with a -1 penalty; against {@i complex master glyphs} the penalty is -2. Only one saving throw is permitted against the whole battery of magical effects radiated by a {@i master glyph} or a {@i complex master glyph}.",
					"This glyphic skill is central to the savant's position within aboleth society. Being very lawful, ordinary aboleth acquiesce to the greater power of the savants as a matter of course, but this ability to defend and protect the aboleth city with a battery of {@i complex glyphs} earns the savant aboleth the loyalty and respect of ordinary aboleth.",

Their diet is the same as that of ordinary aboleth - algae, fish, diverse water plants, and the like - but they have an especial liking for the flesh of spellcasters and magic-using creatures, as noted above. Savant aboleth have no natural enemies. Virtually all intelligent marine life knows well enough to give them an extremely wide berth."

When their quarry is helpless, others move in to help dispatch the prey. Then they loot the corpse for trinkets, anything colorful and lively to gaze at after they return to the gloom of the Shadow fell."

					"Shambling mounds, or \"shamblers\", appear as heaps of rotting vegetation. They are actually an intelligent form of vegetable life, roughly humanoid shaped, with a height of six to nine feet and a girth of about six feet at their base (legs to waist) and two feet at their summit (the \"head\").",
					"HABITAT / SOCIETY",
					"Shambling mounds are only found in regions of dense rainfall and vegetation. Dismal swamps, marshes, and rain forests are their favorite climes, but some wet subterranean places also serve as shambled lairs. They are solitary beasts, only rarely living in the same area as other shamblers \u2014 usually only in areas where the food source is constant (e.g., near famous ruins or abandoned gold mines, etc.).",
					"ECOLOGY",
					"The shambling mound is an animate clump of vegetation with a small brain-like control center located deep within the \"chest\" cavity. Decapitating a shambling mound, therefore, does not harm it in the least. Since a shambling mound's \"limbs\" are merely aggregated clumps of vine and moss, the removal of one or more of them does not hamper the creature either. Remaining vines along the torso will join together to form a new limb by the next round. Only when enough of the shambling mound has been hacked away will the creature die.",
					"Note that a wounded shambling mound need only retreat to a dense clump of wet foliage to heal. It will rise again in 12 hours, fully healed. It is likely to be very angry as well.",
					"Since shamblers gain power from electrical attacks, it is suspected that there may exist some shamblers that are vastly larger than the common ones seen thus far. Since will-o-wisps and shamblers often inhabit the same desolate regions of the world, it is possible that shambling mounds of 20 Hit Dice or more lie in the deepest, darkest swamps and jungles."

They have human skin tones ranging to a light yellow-green, and their hair can be almost any color, though silver and dark green are the most common. Sirines have beautiful figures and wear scanty clothing at best. Most sirines are antisocial, so they try to drive intruders away, with evil sirines taking stronger measures.",
					"Other sirines are hungry for social interaction, and try to lure male humans or demihumans to join them for a time. Sirines speak their own language and the language of the nearest intelligent races. They can breathe water and air, and they have infravision to a range of 120 feet.",
					"HABITAT / SOCIETY",
					"Sirines are encountered only in lonely places that are otherwise uninhabited. Most live near rocky outcroppings or small islands in the sea. Some choose to live in fresh water, but tend to avoid these areas because they are usually populated and sometimes difficult to reach. Young sirines often live with their sisters; these sirines are the more social type. As a sirine grows older, she becomes more reclusive and contemplative, however, and eventually looks for a home of her own where she can think and sing in solitude.",
					"Even then, they have a rare desire for companionship. Sirines usually mate with male humans. Some sirines choose elves, tritons, or merfolk as mates, producing children with some of their parents' traits (pointed ears from elves, green skin from aquatic elves, scales and webbed fingers and toes from merfolk and tritons). Sirines never form lasting relationships, for the call of the sea is too great to bind them.",
					"After a gestation period of nine months, they give birth to 1d4 baby sirines, which are cared for by their mother until they are five years old. After that, they fend for themselves, living on the bounty of the sea. Reaching adulthood at 10 years, they live for about 50 years, and yet their beauty never leaves them. Sirines live to sing, and to think about the sea.",
					"If deprived of their voices, or confined away from water, they will slowly wither away until they die. Sirines often have great knowledge regarding the history of their area and any current events. They sometimes trade this knowledge for companionship.",
					"ECOLOGY",
					"Sirines are not harmful to their environment in any manner. They kill only enough to eat, and never take too much from the sea. They have few natural enemies, and they are more than able of taking care of themselves.",

They speak the tongue of air and earth elementals, a howling, shrieking tongue that frightens most humans who hear it.",

At rest, a skriaxit appears to be a wind-scattered pile of black dust. When they attack they create their greatest terror, generating high winds and a fierce sandstorm that can render a human fleshless in minute.",

					"HABITAT / SOCIETY",
					"Skulks survive by thievery and murder. They live in small bands, moving often, and camping in deep forests or underground lairs.

					"A skulk lair is usually a shallow cave with two or more entrances, located just outside (or sometimes beneath) the town. Skillfully placed branches and leaves cover the entrance. A successful find secret doors roll is required to find the entrance to a skulk lair. Inside are a number of sleeping mats. During the day 1d3 skulk children are found here, usually unguarded. There is a 10% chance that one of the children is less than two years of age. In that case a single skulk female will be in the cave. If the cave is discovered, the skulk female will flee, leaving the children to their fate.",
					"Skulks often try to disrupt the society they prey upon. A common ploy is to murder a low-level political official (judge, council member, town steward, etc.), then leave behind false clues stolen from a local thieves' guild or orc tribe. Once suspicion is diverted, the skulks can go about their business, murdering and looting with impunity.",
					"Most skulks are panic prone, but very rarely (1%) a leader is born. Skulk leaders are demanding and cruel. They have 3 Hit Dice and can speak two additional languages. Skulk leaders are masters of disguise and sometimes pose as half-elves or humans. While in this disguise, skulk leaders mingle freely with the outside world, casing a town before leading an attack on it. Normal skulks will abide by a leader's commands so long as they aren't too daring. Skulk leaders sometimes deal with other creatures, particularly {@creature doppelganger|AGGMM}s or assassin guilds.",
					"ECOLOGY",
					"Skulks eat whatever they find in the pantry of their victims. In hard times, skulks steal livestock, leaving a hole in the fence so it appears the animal escaped accidentally.",
					"In addition to food, skulks steal whatever strikes their fancy. Female skulks often take gold, jewelry, and fine cloths. Male skulks are apt to lug furniture back to their camp. Disputes over property are common but infighting is rare. Instead, skulks steal from one another at the first opportunity.",
					"All monsters who hunt humans and demihumans hunt skulks, but their camouflage ability makes skulks difficult prey. Skulks are despised by intelligent creatures; any skulk captured by a demihuman or human community is dealt with in the harshest manner allowable - usually death."

					"Slithering trackers are transparent, plasma-draining jellies found in many dungeons and other dark places.",
					"They are not invisible per se, but are instead made of a transparent jelly-like material. Thus they are almost impossible to detect normally (only a 5% chance of happening to notice one).",
					"HABITAT / SOCIETY",
					"Slithering trackers are solitary beasts. Since they possess no attack form capable of harming other trackers, territoriality is a question of first-come, first-serve. Being the most intelligent of all slimes and jellies, it would seem natural that slithering trackers would establish themselves as the leaders of the rest. But jellies and slimes lack both the means of communication and the intelligence to band together. They remain on the lower end of the monster food chain, serving as scavengers that kill the weak and stupid, leaving the larger creatures for major predators in the dungeons they inhabit.",
					"In fact, slithering trackers often hide themselves in the lairs of large monsters, which are known to kill far more than they can eat at a sitting. The tracker waits until the beast goes to sleep or departs and then it sucks dry the morsels left over. Many times the victims are merely unconscious instead of dead \u2014 at least until the tracker gets to them. And on more than one occasion, monster-slaying players have left a hoard guarded by a comrade, while they go for help, only to return to find their friend mysteriously dehydrated, with all of the treasure still in the lair.",
					"ECOLOGY",
					"There are two theories regarding the origin of slithering trackers. The first and most likely one is that slithering trackers are just advanced forms of the other jellies, fortunate enough to have developed a transparent plasma body and a modicum of intelligence. Like most jellies, they reproduce asexually when the time and quantity of food allow for it.",
					"The second, more dubious theory, is that slithering trackers were created, not born. Their high intelligence seems to lead many knowledgeable sages to believe that the creation of a slithering tracker is a hideous process, involving the transformation of a living human being. Certain legends seem to support this assertion, as there are many accounts of dark wizards removing the bones of their enemies, turning them into hulking masses of jelly-like flesh.

					"Spinagons, though lowly, gain status quickly by gathering armies for greater baatezu. Often less influential baatezu get their armies last, whereas the more important baatezu get theirs immediately. Because of this, spinagons are subject to abuse and threats by middle-level baatezu disappointed with their performance.",
					"Baator is a strange place, ruled by a perverse discipline that simultaneously encourages both structured behavior and treachery. But stranger still is the advancement process of the spinagon. When a spinagon advances, those it has served decide how much advancement the spinagon receives. Therefore, if a spinagon serves a {@creature gelugon|AGGMM} well, it may be promoted as high as amnizu. Stories tell of the {@creature pit fiend|AGGMM3} Greth advancing a spinagon to a {@creature hamatula|AGGMM2}."

					"Material Plane usually arrives as something different - something disembodied. When a warlock or other spellcaster establishes communication with it, the seer-entity takes control of the mortal's form and spirit, transforming it into a star spawn seer. Whoever the seer once was largely vanishes beneath the corpulent bulk of tumorous skin than builds up in strange whorls all over the seer's body. Hands become bulky, flipper-like appendages capable of grasping their strange staffs-formed of some blend of flesh, bone, and star stuff- but clumsy and painful when used to manipulate other things. A star spawn seer is almost always accompanied by one or more star spawn hulks. Although the hulk is a worthy combatant in its own right, it's also a vital part of a tactic often used by seers. When a seer deals psychic damage to a hulk, the hulk isn't hurt, while the effect ricochets off the hulk and expands to assault other creatures. The seer's goal is to tap the energy sources and master the rites that will enable it to extend a bridge between the vulnerable sanity of the Material Plane and the squirming madness of an Elder Evil's prison."

					"DESCRIPTION",
					"Stirges are bird-like creatures that drink the blood of their victims for sustenance. They have four small, pincer-like legs that they use to clamp onto the necks of their victims. They are rusty-red to reddish brown in color, and their eyes and feet are yellowish. The dangling proboscises of stirges are pink at the tip, fading to gray at the base (near their heads).",
					"HABITAT / SOCIETY",
					"Stirges form nest-like colonies in attics, dungeons, and copses of trees. Although they resemble birds, they hang upside down when sleeping, indicating that stirges may be closely related to vampire bats.",
					"Stirges can breed in captivity, but a constant supply of blood is needed. Stirges mostly kill low-level humans, animals and children, so the arrival of these predators in any civilized territory is always a cause for alarm. Fortunately, even a low-level group of adventurers or town militia is usually capable of ending the menace with little or no loss of life.",
					"ECOLOGY",
					"Stirges have an acute sense of smell, can see in the dark, and can sense heat sources. These senses keep stirges informed when living creatures enter their habitat. Creatures with thick scales are usually immune to a stirge's blood draining attack, since their hides are too thick to penetrate. As a consequence, huge nests of stirges live symbiotically with some evil dragons.",
					"Characters who protect their entire bodies with special leather or better armor (this special armor costs two to three times more than normal armor) can safely approach a stirge. Even the slightest gap in the protection is seen and smelled by the creature, and a successful attack roll means the creature has broken through the weakness and locked on.",
					"After a stirge has gorged itself by draining blood, it sleeps for one day, plus one day for every 2 points of blood it drank (the maximum sleep period is after drinking 12 points of blood \u2014 seven days). During this period of rest, silent attackers can impose surprise on the stirges, as the beasts wake slowly and remain drowsy for a few moments. They are most vulnerable at this time. While certain species of stirges prefer to dine on human blood, most are content with any large mammal, like cows, moose, and deer. Experienced druids and rangers usually recognize the traces of a stirge colony by the occurrences of mysteriously drained and dead animals in the vicinity.",
					"A stirge colony's territory extends for only a mile in diameter, so stirges move around a lot after they've drained a region of the available blood. Often, the presence of stirges is only discovered long after the colony has departed, making it very difficult to track them."

					"HABITAT / SOCIETY",
					"Stone giants prefer to dwell in deep caves high on rocky, storm-swept mountains. They normally live in the company of their relatives, though such a clans usually include no more than 10 giants. Clans of giants do locate their lairs near each other, however, for a sense of community and protection. A mountain range commonly has 2d4 clans lairing there.",

					"ECOLOGY",
					"Stone giants are omnivorous, but they will eat only fresh food. They cook and eat their meat quickly after it has been killed. They use the skins of the animals for blankets and trade what they do not need with nearby human communities in exchange for bolts of cloth or herd animals which they use for food. Many stone giant bands keep giant goats in and near their lairs so they will have a continuous supply of milk, cheese, and butter."

The individual ants resemble smaller versions of giant ants, red or golden in color with powerful mandibles. The swarm is a mobile colony of 3/4 inches-long workers numbering in the thousands. A single queen, identical to the workers except for her sex and tiny unusable wings, marches in the center the swarm. If the queen is killed, the swarm dissipates.",
					"The swarm moves in a straight line as a solid block of ants. The ants eat all organic matter in their path, including any creatures too, slow to get out of their way. If the ants approach a river or other obstacle, they turn 90 degrees and continue their march. They will not go out of their way to attack and are therefore easy to avoid.",
					"Ants may be scattered with smoke or like; immersion in water washes them off. If half of a swarm is killed, the surviving ants attempt to scatter and hide; since the ants scatter equally in every direction, this actually increases the possibility a creature in the vicinity may be attacked."

					"{@i \"Fear me. Fear my coming. What others know of me is a mask that hides my true might. They think I am vermin, those rats whose brains pulsate with bilious light. They do not know I see through the thousand eyes of my body. My body lives among them, and they do not see me\"}",
					"\"Upon waking I had the image of the cranium rat, commonly seen in the dark corners of pestilent villages, locked into my mind. But my dream was this creature, and yet it was not. Perhaps I will dream it again.\"",
					"Indeed he did dream it again, but Bilfar hever lived to publish his stolen secrets. A month after he penned these words, he was dead. Perhaps his dresms caught another, darker secret, for his servant found him one morning, bled dry from a hundred tiny wounds.",
					"HABITAT / SOCIETY",
					"So continues Bilfar's notes:",
					"\"The vishkar's secrets flee it at night, arriving piecemeal for my studies. Where they come from I cannot tell \u2014 there are too many images of too many places \u2014 but in all of these them is a common thread. It is a pulsing green vein that is the cord to a master who steals secrets from others. I am forced to guess that the vishkar is an agent of Ilsensine, the great god-brain of the illithids. Vishkar is the eyes and ears of its lord, gathering in all it sees and hears to please that ravenous power. A thousand eyes gather a thousand scenes all at once.",
					"\"Curious, I inquired with travelers and caravan masters about the extent of the cranium rat. I myself have seen them in Sigil, and I am told they are not uncommon in the Lower Planes.",
					"\"I have seen myself in my own dreams, asking and re-asking these questions. There are also dreams of packs searching me out. Are these the dreams of my mind, or secrets I have captured? Even my philosophies fail me here, but I think precautions are necessary.\"",
					"ECOLOGY",
					"Cranium rats subsist on a diet only slightly more carnivorous than the normal rat. The extent and purpose of their powers are held closely secret, less Ilsensine's instruments be exposed. Those who discover the true purpose of the cranium rats are under sentence of swift and terrible death."

					"DESCRIPTION",
					"At a mere inch in length, an individual piranha ant is easily dismissed as a harmless insect unworthy of notice. The danger lies not in the individual ant but in the swarm of thousands of the creatures, who fear no foe and can strip a man to his bones in a matter of minutes.",
					"A piranha ant's head is disproportionately larger than that of other ant species. Its sharp mandibles are serrated. The creature is a dull gray or black in color, allowing it to easily blend in with stone, the dirt of the street, or the shadows.",
					"COMBAT",
					"Piranha ants are vicious in combat. They only strike unsuspecting opponents, often waiting until their prey is fast asleep before attacking. This guarantees at least one round of free attack due to surprise. When attacking, the entire colony swarms over the victim, each ant ripping off a hunk of flesh and moving on, making room for others of its kind to attack in turn. Combat with a piranha ant colony is therefore treated as if the victim were battling a single creature.",
					"HABITAT / SOCIETY",
					"Piranha ants live in a mobile colony, making temporary homes in large buildings. They are led by a slightly larger than normal queen in charge of egg production. There are several winged males in each colony, but the vast majority are infertile female warriors.",
					"Together, the thousands of piranha ants making up a colony have a single collective consciousness. Each ant communicates instantly with the others of its colony, and the creatures coordinate attacks with ruthless efficiency.",
					"Piranha ants are similar to the swarms of army ants in the jungle, but in many ways they're worse. Their collective intelligence allows them to plot action in advance. Piranha ants send out scouts to scour the city for likely targets; they prefer humans living alone.",
					"Once a likely target is found, the colony moves into the target building, often living between the walls or in unused basement or attic rooms, well out of sight. Scouts are sent throughout the building to keep an eye on the intended prey. When the time is right (usually after the victim has gone to bed for the night), the ants silently enter the victim's room en masse. More often than not, the victim is slain before he knows what's going on. The ants pick the victim's body clean of flesh and leave as silently as they came.",
					"In winter, piranha ants go to ground, holing up in some out of the way place. The queen lays eggs during the winter, which hatch by winter's end. After a brief larval stage, the pupae are sealed into cocoons from which they emerge by spring, ready to join the colony in swarm attacks.",
					"ECOLOGY",
					" Piranha ants take care to leave no traces of their attacks behind. After an attack, usually only a skeleton remains of the ants' prey. Slain ants are themselves eaten by the surviving colony members; this not only makes use of a food source but also prevents anyone from finding the bodies and figuring out what caused the victim's death.",
					"Piranha ants are at the top of the food chain. While many creatures eat individual ants, none attack the colony as a whole."

					"DESCRIPTION",
					"Rot grubs are disgusting little creatures that resemble maggots. They would be considered inconsequential if not for their horrifying attack form.",
					"Rot grubs' color ranges from maggot white to dung brown. They are differentiated from maggots by the two tiny antennae nubs on their heads. Their size ranges from ½ inch to two inches long, with some unusual specimens getting as long as three inches. Most of the time (75%), rot grubs are mistaken for regular worms or maggots.",
					"HABITAT / SOCIETY",
					"Rot grub swarms are occasionally found in heaps of offal or dung. They are seldom found in ceilings, floors, or walls, but it is possible. Sometimes, undead such as {@creature ghoul|AGGMM}s, {@creature ghast|AGGMM}s, {@creature zombie|AGGMM4}s, or {@creature wight|AGGMM4}s carry rot grubs, though the little beasts have no effect on these undead hosts. In jungle and swamp areas, rot grubs can be found in heaps of rotting plants. Anyone who is so foolish as to walk barefoot in such areas gets what he deserves!",
					"Once the host is dead, rot grubs use the corpse as a nesting place for their eggs. These creatures lack both treasure and the intellect to collect treasure. Still, on a rare (1%) chance, rot grubs are encountered while still inside a recently killed victim. In such rare cases, the chance of treasure is handled under treasure type I, K, L, and M.",
					"As mentioned earlier, rot grub are fond of living flesh, though they have been known to eat dead flesh. plants, and other things best left not mentioned. Still, if they have a choice, they will always choose living tissue.",
					"ECOLOGY",
					"Rot grubs are often sought by assassins. Placing one or two of these on a sleeping victim usually ensures a quick, quiet death. Furthermore, unless a physican knows what to look for, the cause of death cannot be determined.",
					"Giant ants, centipedes, and spiders include rot grubs in their diet. What is worse, however, is that certain subterranean races such as {@creature illithid|AGGMM2}s, {@creature kuo-toa|AGGMM2}, {@creature troll|AGGMM4}s, and {@creature troglodyte|AGGMM4}s savor rot grubs as delicacies, eating them much the same as one would eat meal worms.",
					"Alchemists have tried to devise a means of extracting the juice from rot grubs in hopes of coming up with a workable anesthetic. Thus far all attempts have been unsuccessful. There are rumors that rot grubs are used as material components in certain harm-causing spells, usually the reverse versions of healing and restorative spells."
