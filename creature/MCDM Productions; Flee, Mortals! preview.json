A dozen outlaw goblins are supremely (and perhaps overly) confident. Such groups often become bandits that ambush travelers in their territories, be it desert, forest, or underground. Larger bands may become unscrupulous mercenaries serving powerful villains. No matter how they're encountered, goblins prefer to fight as an overwhelming force and flee when foes outnumber friends.",

				"This elegant cloak is lined with the iridescent mane of a lightbender. When you're hit with an attack while wearing this cloak, you can use your reaction to reveal that the attacker is attacking a past visual imprint of you. You appear in an unoccupied space you can see within 30 feet of your imprint, the attack misses, then the imprint disappears. You can't use this reaction if the attacker relies on senses other than sight, such as blindsight, or if they can perceive illusions as false, as with truesight. Once you use the cloak to reveal a past visual imprint of yourself, you can't do so again until the next dawn."
