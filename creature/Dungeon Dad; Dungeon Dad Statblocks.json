Their entire culture is built atop the knowledge and whispered secrets they have glimpsed in the great beyond.",

Though they are normally placid scholars, more likely to enter a lively philosophical debate with other creatures than a brawl, moon giants can become violent when disturbed or when under the influence of a bad moon. There is something truly powerful about their connection to the moon and its cycles, and much is still unknown about how these complex systems directly affect the giants attuned with them.",

They often use magic to induce sleep in themselves for long periods of time, during which they are able to travel to the plane of dreams and explore many strange places. These journeys are usually aided by clerics of the moon giant faith, and in some cases can last decades.",

					"Plush golems are constructs crafted to look like large stuffed animals. They can take a  wide variety of shapes and come in many different colors, however, one thing always remains true. If anyone should threaten their owner, there will be hell to pay.",
					"The Gift That Keeps Giving. Plush golems are every parent's worst nightmare. They are typically given as gifts to young children, usually by obnoxious aunts or uncles. Plush golems seem like ordinary stuffed animals at first to most, but eventually reveal their animated state of being to the children who own them. As most children tend to treat their toy animals more like live creatures than playthings, it can become extremely frustrating for some parents as the child insists that the toy be allowed to eat at the dinner table, go along on outings, and take part in other family activities.",
					"Artisanal Playthings. Plush golems are finely crafted stuffed animals and may be formed from velvet, cotton, or wool. They are usually stuffed with cotton batting, but are sometimes partly filled with dried beans. They may be created in realistic colors to represent a real bear, panda, lion, or tiger, or they may be fabricated into fantastic creatures such as pink elephants, purple rabbits, or lime green monkeys.",
					"Fierce Guardians. While they are built to be soft and friendly, if the owner of a plush golem is ever threatened, the creature will spring into action and fight mercilessly to defend its master. Plush golems are often an unforeseen line of defense against would-be burglars, kidnappers, or other criminals. This makes them an ideal companion for children born into noble houses as they provide more protection than a mere bodyguard, and are often underestimated as simple toys."

					"YELLOW DRAGONS",
					"Selfish and cunning, yellow dragons hold dominion over seaside cliffs, salt flats, and coastal marshes. They are secretive and elusive in the extreme, opting to take a clever and subtle approach to problem solving rather than relying solely on draconic might. A yellow dragon is easily recognized by its elongated narrow jaws, oversized claws, and its slender body. Yellow dragons vary in color from brilliant hues of sunny yellow to flaxen shades of wheat. Their scales are much smaller than that of a typical dragon and are constantly being replaced, giving their skin a texture more akin to a snake than a lizard. This smooth scale pattern also allows them to more easily navigate through water and dirt.",
					"The Missing Dragons. Ancient lore holds true that all the chromatic dragons were born from Tiamat, the queen of dragons. The more common varieties of chromatic dragon (white, black, red, green, and blue) were all made in the image of their mother, who has a draconic head of each color. However, there are other varieties of chromatic dragon that have a more mysterious origin. Purple, orange, and yellow dragons did not originate from Tiamat, but they certainly do exist. This quandary has divided scholars for ages, but there are two prevalent theories about their origin. Some think Tiamat may have experimented with her children before unleashing them upon the world, trying to create even stronger breeds. Secondary-color crossbreeds could have bred true with each other, starting new branches of the dragon family tree. Sages also speculate as to the possibility of another chromatic dragon deity, Tiamat's sister perhaps, arrayed with heads of yellow, orange, purple, and other crossbred colors. Tiamat may have destroyed her sibling eons ago, but not before the creation of dragons in the image of their deceased progenitor.",
					"Selfish. Yellow dragons are incredibly selfish, even by the standards of other chromatic dragons. Many scholars believe the primary reason they have become so obscure is due to the fact that during the war waged by dragons against the giants, the yellow dragons offered no help. In fact, yellow dragons were said to remove themselves from the conflict entirely, not willing to risk their lives for the benefit of their kind. This led to them being reviled by other dragons and ultimately to the destruction of many yellow dragon lands. To this day, the yellow dragons keep to themselves, knowing that should they ever make their presence known they will be surrounded by enemies.",
					"Cunning Trappers. Unlike most other dragons, even in their oldest stages of life, the yellow dragon prefers to use ambush tactics and traps when engaging in battle. They are not as physically powerful as some of their other draconic cousins, but yellow dragons are extremely fast and capable of traveling through water, sand, and rock with relative ease. They use this unique mobility to their utmost advantage and will only ever take a fight they know will end in victory. A favorite trap of theirs is to dig a cone-shaped pit with steep sides, then bury themselves at the bottom. When prey inevitably stumbles into such a trap, the yellow dragon then moves its wings, causing the pit to collapse.",
					"Isolationist. Due to the fact that yellow dragons are hated by most for being dragons, and hated by other dragons for their actions throughout history, they have become quite isolated. They speak a strange dialect of Draconic unique to yellow dragons and will typically not learn any other languages since they have no desire to communicate with anyone outside of their own kind. This adds another layer of complexity to encountering a yellow dragon. If an individual approaches without an understanding of their language, even if they use magic such as the tongues spell to communicate, the yellow dragon is unlikely to trust or respect them."

The only way to remove the curse is the casting of a remove curse spell or equivalent during the victim's slumber while they are plagued with nightmares.

					"{@b {@i Beware the Bagman.}} Some say \"The Bagman\" is merely an urban legend. One version of the story tells of an adventurer who sought to escape certain death by abandoning his companions and hiding inside a bag of holding. Later, when he tried to leave the bag, he became lost amid a constantly increasing number of extra dimensional storage spaces. Over time, the strange forces of this magical in-between place transformed the adventurer into a monstrous creature. Now, every night, The Bagman slips out from a random bag of holding. If he doesn't find his home, he drags someone back into the bag with him and leaves behind some trinket from his hidden kingdom of lost junk. Some say that if you speak too loudly over an open bag of holding or whisper \"follow my voice\" into a magical storage space, space three times, The Bagman will come for you. Whether this is the true genesis of the bagman or not, the fact remains that a bagman is a very real threat, and a fate worse than death awaits those dragged into the realm from which they hail.",
					"{@b {@i \"Men\", Not \"Man\".}} The myth of The Bagman would suggest that there is only one \"Bagman\", however, the reality is much more sinister. When a bagman comes through a bag of holding into the material world, it does so in an attempt to find its way back to wherever it originally came from. When it is unsuccessful in finding its home, the creature always attempts to drag another sentient creature back with it into the bizarre realm it calls home, the \"Space Between Spaces\". If its kidnapping attempt is successful, it will typically abandon the creature before long as it continues its quest to find a way back home. Creatures who don't make it back to the material world will find themselves slowly twisted into a new bagman, destined to the same nightly ritual of obsessively trying to find their way back to where they came from. Why bagmen kidnap creatures is a mystery. Some scholars posit that it is a twisted reflex. That maybe they recognize their own perverse nature and a part of them hopes to be delivered from their predicament by somebody with their mind still intact. Others believe they do so at the behest of a dark entity, an unknown evil that is responsible for the creation of the first bagman who uses them as a means to gather twisted subordinates for some scheme that is yet to be revealed.",
					"{@b {@i The Space Between Spaces.}} For ages it was thought that the space inside a bag of holding was a self contained one, completely separate from the rest of the multiverse, but this is not so. All of these spaces are mere fragments of a much larger plane which scholars refer to as the \"Space Between Spaces\". Every extra-dimensional space such as that found within a bag of holding or portable hole connects to an isolated fragment of this bizarre demi-plane, but for the bagmen and other creatures native to the \"Space Between Spaces\", a bag of holding is not an isolated area, but a gateway to and from the material world. It is unclear if the first magic user to create a bag of holding truly knew what they were doing. Did they know they were linking our world with a nearly empty one governed by monsters? Or perhaps they never stopped to think that there might be something lurking on the other side.",

					"GRISGOL",
					"This humanoid figure is wrapped from head to toe in strips of scroll parchment and pages from dusty tomes. Pieces of tattered magic belts, robes, and chainmail also seem haphazardly integrated into its form.",
					"Living Hordes. A grisgol is a horrifying construct composed of broken and worn-out magic items, animated by a powerful spellcaster who has harnessed the spirit of a lich. Its skeleton is fabricated from old staffs and wands and its skin from expended scrolls wrapped about it like a mummy's burial cloth. Woven into this are rings, bracers, fragments of leather or chainmail, and the like. Inside the creature are scores of half-empty vials of potions, unguents, and oils, vaguely resembling sets of internal organs. It typically wears a rune-scribed cloak or robe. Pinpoints of red light glare from underneath a hood or old helmet.",
					"Heart of Darkness. Nestled inside the construct, among miscellaneous junk, is the original lich's phylactery. Unless one knows what animates a grisgol, the phylactery appears as another piece of spent magic trash tossed loosely and randomly into the insides of the construct.",
					"Mistaken Identity. From a distance, a grisgol appears to be a mummy, even moving with a similar stiff gait. When it walks, one can hear the tinkling of glass touching glass, the sloshing of half-filled vials and bottles, the squeaking of leather, the rubbing of wood and bone against each other, and, most prominently, the shuffling of paper as if pages of a tome were caught in a slight breeze. Thin tendrils of black smoke escape from cracks in its body. A grisgol leaves a sooty, oily residue upon whatever it touches.",
					"Lich's Power. A grisgol is in every way a magic construct, possessing all traits native to golems in addition to the abilities of the lich that powers it. A grisgol's damaging and paralysing touch attacks are drawn from the lich's soul within and the construct retains a fraction of the original lich's spell-casting ability. A grisgol only casts the spells scribed by its creator on the scrolls and tome pages that make up its outer skin. Destroying a grisgol does not destroy the lich that powers it. To kill the lich, its phylactery must be destroyed after the grisgol is destroyed. Otherwise, the lich is free to return in a physical form in 1d10 days. The escaped lich retains all the powers and abilities it had previous to its entrapment. The lich seeks vengeance upon whoever possesses its phylactery and the wizard, sorcerer, or cleric who originally entrapped it in the body of a grisgol.",
					"Programmed Fighters. A grisgol is tenacious and relentless, following its creator's instructions explicitly without regard to strategy. Therefore, a grisgol's spell usage is often scripted ahead of time by its creator, unless its creator is within 60 feet of the golem and is able to issue commands.",
					"Construction. A grisgol's body is a haphazard collection of old magic wands, staffs, potions, miscellaneous items, and, most importantly, scraps of scrolls and magic tomes. This costs approximately 10,000 GP. Assembling the body requires a DC 20 Arcana check and a {@item manual of golems||manual of golem creation}.",
					"Mercenary Gear. Grisgols are often cobbled together by fledgling magic users that happen upon enough magic infused trash to craft themselves a golem. This means that the end result, a grisgol, is typically sold off as a weapon or tool to those with the need for such things. Because of this, a grisgol might end up with a wide array of different spells, all based on what spell scrolls were available to the creator, but also tailored according to the client's needs. A mercenary band might request a grisgol with healing spells or powerful long range magic. The creation of grisgol's is banned in many kingdoms, as it typically doesn't serve the rulership to have magic items left unaccounted for, especially if those magic items are being used by potential rebels orother groups that pose a threat to the stability of a region."

					"When a city grows corrupt, its people succumbing to degradation and decadence, the seams of the natural world can be split so that the evil of the Abyss  seeps through. A city corruptor is not a punishment for a people's lack of moral fortitude; it is a consequence. A natural predator of the urban environment, the city corruptor stalks the dark streets that are the arteries of the city it feeds on. As the city's weak and vulnerable begin to die in increasing numbers, this foul demon spreads fear among even the most powerful.",
					"Demonic Predation.  City corruptors appear in desperate, depraved, or hopeless urban centres. Places where the people either cannot reverse the moral decay of their city, or where they do not care to. A city corruptor is not attracted to combat. Rather, the demon lusts after the blood of victims lost to an environment shifting closer to collapse each day. To hasten the destruction of such an environment is every city corruptor's ultimate delight.",
					"The Portal Alignment. These sly demons first appeared in Zelatar, spreading quickly to other abyssal settlements. As a mortal city decays, the nature of an abyssal city aligns with it, and a city corruptor can step through the newly created gateway. Only one demon passes through during such an alignment. City corruptors fight among themselves for the exclusive right to claim a city in the mortal realm. Once a city is claimed, the corruptor gets to work. In the event that the city falls in its entirety, many of its people are sure to be dead, and the survivors along with the city itself are dragged into the Abyss, leaving behind a barren and lifeless dead spot in the Material Plane.",
					"Dead Spots. A dead spot is what gets left behind when a city is pulled into the Abyss. The dead spot appears as a soot-covered patch of land that always seems to be in the shade, even on the brightest day. It encompasses the entire area where the city was as well as the surrounding three miles. Nothing can or ever will grow in this place again. Dead spots are intrinsically linked to the Abyss, and as such, are often sought out by cultists and summoners who wish to draw on the power of demons. The only way to remove them is to sever the link by travelling to the Abyss, finding the demon responsible for the city's downfall, and killing them.",
					"Demonic Kingpins. A city corruptor's primary means of achieving its goal is to wage a campaign of terror to destroy a city from within. They are extremely charismatic and will not hesitate to draw on their overwhelmingly magnetic personality traits to amass minions such as murderers, assassins, thieves, and other supernatural urban predators such as wererats or doppelgangers. When other demons come into the picture, however, the city corrupter refuses to share its plans with them as it seeks to be glorified as the only demon involved."

					"Spawn of Madness Skinwalkers are born to serve Demogorgon, the demon lord, through a foul ritual. During this ritual, a priest of Demogorgon flays the skin of a living humanoid using a lash prepared from the claws and intestines of a demonic lion known as a jarilith. At the end of the process, the victim is burned alive on a pyre. However, just before the sacrifice perishes, the skin of the jarilith is thrown into the fire, at which point the two merge and become one.",
					"Ancient Weaponry Many cults of Demogorgon have existed far before the current age of civilization. While most certainly mad, these cults often uphold the traditions that have prevailed since their inception, particularly in their tools of bloodshed. The macuahuitl is one such weapon. While not invented by one such cult, it was common use in the time when many cults of Demogorgon held their apex of power. A brutal weapon, the macuahuitl is a fine club crafted to house dozens of extremely sharp obsidian shards. This weapon is unparalleled in raw destructive power, however it is quite fragile, and often in the ferocity of battle the obsidian elements will break, crack, or find themselves in need of replacement.  ",
					"Natural Poisons Skinwalkers are fond of augmenting their attacks with poison. As survivalists they are extremely knowledgeable when discerning which plants and other natural elements can be used to inflict terrible pain. Their constant exposure to such substances has granted them a degree of resistance to their own poisons as well as a terrific offensive option."

This process takes 15 days, whereupon a small sliver of white appears on the left side and moves across the dragon until, 15 days later, it is all white again. The dragon's strength and alignment vary with its coloration. Each \"phase\" lasts seven days. When the dragon is all black, it is at full strength and lawful evil. When either black-white or white-black, its alignment is neutral evil. When all white, it is chaotic evil. When the moon dragon is all white, it holds sway over lycanthropes, and can even force them into their animalistic form."

To the astronomer, it may be a fascinating event, deserving of further study. However, to those aware of what beings lurk in the feywild, it is something to be feared. The eye of a namorrodor scours the land in search of prey. Almost panther-like in its behaviour, this gaunt, sleek predator searches for unfortunate souls. Using its ability to sense the waning life energy of those on death's door, the namorrodor hopes for an easy kill.",

					"A namorrodor spends much of its time resting in the feywild. There it remains, until the sun sets on the world of mortals. When the hour grows dark, the namorrodor emerges from its home to hunt. These creatures are often referred to as meteor spirits due to the fact that as they stalk the night sky their glowing yellow eyes are often mistaken for the light of distant stars or other bright objects seen in the heavens above.",

This pair of white eyes allows them to detect and examine the life energy of mortal beings. They use these eyes to hunt prey that are easily taken down, and as a way of avoiding groups of strong enemies. Often their targets are quite elderly or very young. For this reason communities that exist nearby active openings to the feywild know to safeguard their young and elderly during nightfall. The other favourite hunting ground of the namorrodor is the battlefield after some kind of great conflict. Often soldiers and mercenaries are not well versed in the legends of the meteor spirits, making their wounded a prime target for such creatures.  ",
					"Lone Hunters.",
					"Namorrodor hunt by themselves almost exclusively. It is exceedingly rare to see more than one of these creatures hunting at the same time. The only exception to this rule is when a pair of namorrodor have formed a mating bond and are seeking to build a new nest to raise their young before going their separate ways. In such instances, the pair will work together to gather as much food as possible, and will act with aggression unusual even for their kind."

					"It was the most peculiar thing. The sun was high in the summer sky, the weather temperate and mild. Yet the farmers across the town fervently began to usher their animals inside. The braying of beasts could be heard in all directions, as not a farmhand stood idle, working towards a combined effort the likes of which I've never seen. Surely this town was far and away from my homeland, but I wouldn't imagine the way food is grown and animals tended to be much different here than anywhere else. I was wrong. I was finally able to grab the attention of a young man who had just finished ushering his cattle into shelter, he nearly jumped out of his skin when I grabbed his shoulder. \"What in the hells!\" he exclaimed, before realizing there was no danger. I asked him what all the fuss was about, and he simply replied \"It's coming\". What was I supposed to make of that? I looked all around, confused, seemingly the only sane individual for miles on end. Then suddenly, it was quiet. Everyone had gone inside. Not a soul in the streets to be seen. I made haste towards the inn, my home away from home these past few days. Perhaps someone there would be of assistance in clearing up my ignorance to whatever the issue at hand was. I walked up the creaky wooden steps, a faint breeze blowing through the bushes. Locked. I knocked for what seemed like a good few minutes before I got any response. The wind began to pick up. \"Mister, you better find somewhere to hide\" a small voice came from the other side of the door. This simply added to my confusion, but I was starting to get concerned. My horse, who was tied up near the watering trough began to cause a stir. The wind was becoming worrisome. How in the nine hells had these people known a storm was brewing on such a clear day. The polite knocking turned to pounding. Something was wrong. I could practically cut through this feeling with a dagger. A voice deep inside of me screamed it was no longer safe. I started to panic. What was happening? The wind was now howling, yet the clouds showed no sign of tempest. At this very moment I heard the door unlatch, and a small boy was standing there, a disgruntled looking father over his shoulder. \"Come in if yer comin' in\" bellowed the man as the boy grabbed my arm and guided me towards shelter. Just as I passed over that threshold, I saw, for the briefest moment, something I'm not fully sure I can describe. The sun was blotted out of the sky. At mid day, it became night. A shadow cast over the entire town. The wind became so violent, trees struggled to keep themselves within the dirt. Then there was that sound. A low, gut wrenching tone vibrated the very structure I stood upon. As the innkeep secured the door behind us, I rushed to the window. Pressed against the floor, revealing as little of myself as possible, I peered through the wooden reinforcements that covered most of the window. What I saw, was my horse. He was sailing through the air, grasped in the clutches of a monster the likes of which I have never conceived. The look on my face must have betrayed my state, as the boy sidled over to me, answering the question that would not escape my lips. In a soft tone, he simply said, \"Diablotra\".",

Those who have actually seen the twisted land find themselves mute upon its mention. They speak only cryptic warnings of things so absurd, you'd have to be a madman to conceive them.

Then, there's the most outlandish of them all. The living tsunami. The monstrosity so large it could snap a ship in two with a single claw as though it were a mere splinter. The protector goddess of the golden shores. Praesigira. As if something so outlandish could actually exist. Surely the only reason this island paradise has not been conquered is because it simply doesn't exist. Or, does it? Remember when I said this exotic locale has found no purchase inked on parchment? I lied. For there was one man, one absolutely broken man, who came back from the edge of the world. He hasn't said a word since he washed up on shore. He simply trembles, eyes bulging, frantically looking in all directions. Clutched In his hand as his wretched form met the docks? A finely crafted scrap of lambskin.

					"Perfectly Balanced. Possessing both celestial and demonic heritage, the concordant killers are beings of pure neutrality. Some say concordant killers were an experiment by gods of neutrality, who sought to create the perfect stewards for maintaining the cosmic balance. Others hold that they were created by a long-forgotten demigod to serve as bodyguards. It is theorised that, whatever their original purpose, they failed in that endeavour, and their master was lost to a cosmic rival. Left without direction, they settled into the role of mercenaries. Whatever the truth, as beings of neutrality, concordant killers are concerned with the balance of all forces in the planes. They understand that defeating a powerful foe might tip the scales one way or another. Therefore they track their kills as a group, endeavouring to distribute their prey evenly among the the forces of the multiverse. . They keep the location of such meetings secret, though many sages believe they congregate near the central spire of the Outlands. Even deities' magic is impeded there, making it a perfect spot for clandestine gatherings.",
					"The Last of Their Kind. Concordant killers do not reproduce, so every one that falls in battle forever reduces their number. Anyone who destroys a concordant killer inevitably becomes the target of its irate and vengeful kin. They exist in their current state to hunt down and destroy other powerful creatures. Effective yet discreet, they are highly sought after by powerful entities such as demon lords, demigods, and even deities to do their dirty work. A concordant killer is dismissive of any prospective employer, though, unless offered substantial payment.  Concordant killers trade their services for favours, having little need for material possessions. Sometimes they request these favours at the time of hiring, but usually a contract for future payment suffices. Even gods are indebted to the concordant killers and so might look the other way, leave a planar portal open, provide information on a target's whereabouts, or undertake other favours that help the killers achieve their objectives. In the case of a recent death among their ranks, the favour may include the resurrection of a fallen comrade.",

Such swarms are real threats in larger cities, where they infest the magic districts and threaten to claim entire shops that deal in anything magical if not quelled. Although they cannot consume the magical energy stored in magic items, the auras of such items still attract mageripper swarms, much as a candle flame attracts moths. The confused and hungry creatures mill about the item until  they are destroyed or find something else to eat. Consuming magical energy allows the creatures to reproduce, increasing the swarm's size. Individual swarm members live only for a year or so, but when the swarm devours magic, its constituent creatures can double their numbers within days. They reproduce asexually, with young budding from the backs of the adults.",

These keepers often cast spells on a helpless captive or capture and bind a spellcaster, leaving the prisoner as food within the swarm's territory. Magerippers are sentient, although their intelligence is no more the cunning of a predator. They are capable of adapting their tactics to fit new circumstances. Though driven largely by the instinct to feed and reproduce, mageripper swarms can modify their behaviour in response to stimuli."

					"Cold and calculating, orange dragons are just as likely to unleash a mighty roar while making for a defiant charge as they are to attack from ambush. Whatever the most advantageous strategy is, and often the one most likely to cause terror in their enemy, is the strategy the orange dragon opts for. Aside from their scales of blazing orange, the trademark feature of the orange dragon is its long, flat set of jaws similar to that of a crocodile. While no complete and agreed upon record of the orange dragon's origin exists, it is widely agreed that they are the result of a rare mating between red and yellow dragons. Possessing both the unbridled ferocity of red dragons, and the patient nature of the yellow dragon, makes for a deadly combination. In no way is the melding of draconic heritage made more clear than in a demonstration of the orange dragon's breath weapon, a line of pure sodium that can both ignite into flame and explode.",
					"Draconic Rivalries.  Their choice of climate can sometimes put them at odds with black dragons, who also tend to nest in damp locations such as swamps or mires. When this competition for territory arises, black dragons will almost always avoid fighting the more powerful orange dragons, opting either to leave entirely or begrudgingly accept a subordinate role to the orange dragon. Such alliances, however, are fragile and the black dragon will turn on its superior if it thinks it can win in a fight. Orange dragons also have a natural enemy in bronze dragons, who often compete with them for food and territory along the shorelines. Orange dragons seldom attempt to fight with their bronze rivals since they are much more evenly matched than their black dragon cousins.",
					"Solitary Creatures. Orange dragons, like many of their kin, prefer to live in solitude. The one exception to this is when they have found a mate and are caring for a nest of eggs. During this time both parents contribute equally to protecting the nest and raising their young. Once the brood of orange dragons mature beyond the wyrmling stage, they are set to their own devices and the parents typically go their separate ways.",
					"Omnivorous Diets. Orange dragons are mostly meat eaters, feeding on rain forest creatures and fish primarily, but enjoying tropical fruits as well. Humanoid creatures are also appreciated from time to time for the sport they provide the dragon, until they are finally caught and devoured that is. If nothing else is available, the dragon will resort to eating giant insects or fungus if it must. While this is not pleasant for the dragon, its natural poison resistance prevents it from becoming ill."

Most spirit warriors that still exist are guarded by noble Elvish families and treated as relics to be preserved, although there are some which were lost during the war. These lost spirit warriors lay in wait, completely inert, waiting to be rediscovered by a worthy pilot once again.",
					"Biodiverse. Spirit warriors, for the most part,  come in three varieties. The first are carnivores. They are exoskeletons belonging to creatures such as the praying mantis. They have slashing forelimbs and biting mandibles. Their wings often display eyespots that are reflexively displayed before combat begins. Second are the herbivores. These warriors share traits with insects such as the katydid. They come in a wide variety of shapes from noble spindly forms to powerhouses wrapped in thick armoured shells. The third variety of warrior is the nectar. They descend from insects such as the butterfly or wasp. Nektar spirit warriors are brightly coloured with iridescent thoraxes and alternating bands of colour across their abdomens. Their wings are large and colourful, with various patterns. It is also rumoured that even more forms may exist beyond these three, however, if they exist at all, knowledge of their specifications has been lost to time.",
					"Labour of Love. The process of creating a spirit warrior is a lengthy one. It all starts with an egg, no bigger than a sack of grain. This egg is given to the spirit warriors would-be pilot to nurture and protect. When the egg hatches, the pilot must nurture and protect the fragile larva from six months to a year, until it is mature. During this time the insect forms a close emotional bond with the pilot, similar to that of a pet or loyal familiar. After a year the insect is mature, and the spells of modification can begin, however, most pilots choose to delay this process until after the insect has died of old age. If the spells are performed on a living insect, it dies during the ceremony. This is not only cruel, but also serves to weaken the emotional bond between insect and pilot.  The insect becomes a spirit warrior via spells that enlarge, animate, strengthen, and physically modify the insect's exoskeletal remains. These spells also link the minds of pilot and insect in an unbreakable bond, unaffected by magic, disease, physical attack, or mental control. The final stage of the process instals a special helm in the hollow chest cavity of the insect warrior. Once the process is complete, the spirit warrior and pilot can begin working together as a unified pair. In the event that someone other than the original pilot attempts to control the spirit warrior, the insect's spirit gets some say in the matter. If it rejects the new pilot, it can attempt to cause them psychic trauma and shut itself down. Though there are always those who would take their power by force if given the means.",

In order for a creature to pilot the spirit warrior it must be able to fit in the spirit warrior's spelljamming cockpit (typically sized for a medium creature) and have an Intelligence score of at least 8. A creature can enter or exit the cockpit by using an action. While being piloted by another creature, the spirit warrior is entirely under that creature's control and takes its turn in initiative in place of the pilot's turn. If the spirit warrior has to make a saving throw it uses the pilot's saving throw modifier in place of its own. If the spirit warrior takes any amount of psychic damage, the pilot takes the damage instead. If the spirit warrior is reduced to 0 hit points, the pilot must succeed on a {@dc 18} Constitution saving throw or be reduced to 0 hit points. The spirit warrior also has some control over who is allowed to pilot it. If a creature attempts to control the spirit warrior and the spirit warrior does not want to be controlled by that creature, the pilot must succeed on a {@dc 18} Charisma saving throw.

In ancient days, sun giants were a benevolent people, fighting for the good of all living things. Though over time, many sun giants have become increasingly selfish. This has sown discord within their society and led to two predominant schools of thought. There are still those within sun giant society that keep with the old ways of honour, duty, and the mission of protecting all life. The other sect of sun giants believe that they should use their power to exert dominance and shape the world as they see fit.",

Her history as an angel, fallen to the Nine Hells and transformed into a demon in order to fight against the forces of the Abyss serves as a perfect example of the ends justifying the means in the eyes of many sun giants. These individuals will often extort weaker creatures by demanding blood sacrifice in the name of Zariel in exchange for protection.",

To them, the hunt is just as, if not more important, than the meal itself. They actively seek out powerful and elusive creatures so that they might hunt and kill them.

However, for those with something of substance to offer a gray dragon, they can become a powerful ally. Gray dragons have little interest in treasure or riches, but the prospect to hunt a worthy opponent is an offer a gray dragon simply can't refuse. Many gray dragons take up bounty hunting contracts on behalf of anyone who can offer them a proper challenge. These contracts frequently turn into regular working relationships where a gray dragon might rely on a kingdom's bounty board for a steady flow of creatures to hunt, the more dangerous and elusive, the better.",
					"Grim Momentos. Since they have little to no interest in gold and riches, gray dragon's don't hoard valuables in the same way other dragon's might. What they do collect are mementos and trinkets taken from their successful hunts. A gray dragon will keep a vast collection of odds and ends that to anyone else, might seem to be completely useless. These \"treasures\" are all objects of sentimental value to the dragon. What to an onlooker might seem to be a random stone block could be a remnant from a powerful wizard's tower the dragon tore down to get to the spellcaster within. A cracked wagon wheel might be from the wagon of a thief who thought they could flee by horse and carriage. A single pauldron might be from a noble knight who sought to challenge the dragon's authority. Every item within the dragon's collection has a story, and the dragon is bound to know them all. While intrinsic value is of little concern, there are always bound to be a few magical artifacts or useful items that find themselves within this collection by mere happenstance. The older the dragon, the more likely this is to be the case.",
					"A Gray Dragon's Lair",
					"Gray dragons are seldom found in their lair as they are often far away from home stalking prey or seeking out their next avaricious goal. They do, however, maintain a location as their home, even if they aren't there very often. They typically claim secluded locations in badlands, scrublands, dry prairies, or other areas with few visual obstructions. A gray dragon likes to see potential quarry for miles around as they fly high through the air like massive birds of prey. So keen is the eyesight of a gray dragon that it can spot the tiniest movement across a plain from miles away. Once it spots a target, it is liable to dance from cloud to cloud for hours, seeking to bridge the gap between it and its target before swooping in. Gray dragons are also one of the only draconic species that form temporary lairs. While on an extended hunt, far away from its permanent home, a gray dragon is likely to set up a base of operations it can rest in while not actively hunting its prey. Since a gray dragon's permanent lair might stand abandoned for weeks or months at a time, before leaving to go on a hunt, the dragon makes sure to seal the entrance to its home with large rocks or other such obstructions to keep nosy creatures far away."

They were first fashioned using advanced forms of flesh warping magic and lost arcane secrets that very few living beings are aware of. Each one of them started as a willing Elf who underwent numerous transformative rituals until their body was no longer recognizable. They grew to be ten feet tall, their eyes bulged into insect-like compound nerves, they grew scythe-like blades of bone and their skin hardened and became chitinous. All of these features made them perfect killing machines, however, once their duty was done, the very people they had sought to protect discarded them. When peace had finally come to the Astral Elf people, they banished the bionoids to live out their days somewhere far away from Elf society.",
					"Resolute Warriors. Despite their treatment at the hands of their former kin, bionoids have not allowed themselves to give in to despair and hatred. They live relatively peaceful lives in small colonies that dot the multiverse. They have no unified home of which to speak, so instead they make themselves at home in all manner of places. While their appearance might be jarring at first, most communities eventually welcome neighbouring bionoid settlements as they are often both peaceful allies and capable defenders if trouble should appear. While bionoids largely don't wish for warfare, they do still maintain a warrior culture. They train in combat both as a way to protect themselves, and achieve tranquillity over both body and mind. As beings engineered for warfare, they find this helps them control the power they have been granted.",
					"Weird Eggs. Bionoids reproduce in a highly peculiar way. Fully mature bionoid eggs are disc-shaped objects roughly six inches in diameter. They're rigid, dark green in colour, and covered in a thin layer of mucus. In the centre of each egg is the crystalline gem that will eventually find itself in the forehead of the fully grown bionoid. When another living creature touches the egg, it reacts and latches itself onto them, forming a shell around the creature's body. This shell is the bionoid. Once the bionoid has reached the first stage of maturity, usually after about six months, the creature separates itself from the host and begins life as an independent creature. During the time the egg is attached to the host, the bionoid has full control of the creature, though it may choose to relinquish control if it wants. While attached to the host, the two creatures also share a telepathic link and are able to communicate with one another at any time. If the host dies before the bionoid separates itself, the bionoid will revert back to its egg form. This process is typically harmless for the host being, if not unpleasant."

Once it has enthralled a creature, the genius loci may be in total control of the creature's actions, but the creature's personality also tends to fill in many of the gaps in the genius loci's sentience. A genius loci with a particularly cruel and violent thrall is likely to be much more aggressive and quick to battle. Conversely, a genius loci with a more calm and even tempered thrall is going to be much more passive unless threatened. Whatever the situation, anyone enthralled by a genius loci inhabits the landscape of the creature in whatever manner is available to it. Some thralls live in structures which are actually part of the genius loci, while others may nest in trees or burrows.

This intense need for justice in the original creature's killing is the foundation of what a corpse candle is, and if that need is not met, eventually, the spirit of the victim will rise as a revenant.

					"Desert Dwellers. Brown dragons, also known as great desert dragons, occupy many of the massive deserts in the world, though you wouldn't know it unless you went looking for them. Brown dragons prefer to tunnel deep into the desert sands, where they sleep in a burrow at night, surfacing to attack prey. While they can survive indefinitely on a diet of rock and sand, live meat is their preferred game. They are ferocious beasts, and while they are intelligent, they view most humanoid beings as food, and they believe that it is strange to talk with one's meal. Brown dragons are able to digest sand and other mineral materials to sustain themselves over long periods of time. However, meat is their preferred diet, with horseflesh being a particular favourite.",
					"Draconic Dialects. Brown dragons speak their own dialect of draconic language that can sometimes be hard for other draconic speakers to understand. The written language is practically the same, but they make use of many unique phrases that can make their version of draconic sound almost like an entirely different language to the untrained ear.",
					"Bloodthirsty Battles. Battles between brown and blue dragons are legendary for their unbridled ferocity. Many of the people from desert regions occupied by a brown dragon tend to have a curious respect for the brown scaled creatures, so these tales often make the blue dragons look more evil than the brown.",
					"Ambush Predators. These subterranean draconic predators are extremely skilled in the art of the ambush. Young brown dragons are well versed in ambush tactics and will wait for hours beneath the sand if it means a potential meal. As they age, brown dragons learn to leverage their innate magical abilities to create illusions similar to what a wizard with the Hallucinatory Terrain spell might achieve. In the dragon's case, they often use this magic to create an illusion depicting an oasis directly above the place they have buried themselves. Once their prey has come close to get a drink of water, the dragon drops the illusion and strikes from below."

As a result, no mortal creature from the Material Plane can lay a finger on them with the intent of causing harm. If a particularly strong willed creature manages to overcome the magic at play to actually attack a harvester devil, there is also an immediate backlash that weakens the creature as punishment for breaking with cosmic law. Because of this, harvester devils act with a pompous confidence that nothing can harm them. Since few creatures can muster the mental fortitude to attack these fiends openly, when a harvester devil is causing problems many seek to either banish or imprison the fiend instead, but this is no easy task either.",

In one of its hands it clutches a golden staff, and its body is adorned with all manner of arcane trinkets and finery.",
					"Two Headed Corvus. Chronotyryns are large semi-humanoid monstrosities that resemble crows. In much the same way that crows are considered highly intelligent when compared to other common birds, the chronotyryn is a genius among monsters. They are intelligent in the extreme, large in part due to the fact that they have two brains. Unlike other two-headed creatures, such as ettins, the chronotyryn has one singular personality. While they are capable of taking multiple actions simultaneously, the chronotyryn is still one individual personality. It doesn't argue with itself and the two heads never disagree on anything, because they are the same entity. Sometimes the creature will converse with itself creating the illusion that the heads are having a back and forth conversation. This, however, is merely the way a chronotyryn works through its thoughts. When speaking directly to someone else the two heads speak simultaneously, providing an eerie echo for itself.",
					"Imperious Magicians. Chronotyryns are exceptionally talented in the ways of magic and equally condescending. They use their intelligence to master spells that are out of reach for most creatures. This allows them to achieve great things in a short amount of time, and to ensure they are prepared for any situation in battle. By dividing their intellect between two brains, the chronotyryn can cast spells and take other actions in quick succession, sometimes even simultaneously casting two different spells at once. They thirst for knowledge relentlessly and are known to hoard all manner of arcane secrets, only willing to trade them in exchange for something of equal value.",
					"Adamantine Feathers. The feathers of a chronotyryn are nearly impenetrable. They naturally grow a coat of adamantine-infused feathers that makes for both an excellent shield, and a deadly natural weapon. Their feathers are often sought after by blacksmiths as a source of adamantine that does not need to be extracted from a mine. Many chronotyryns are willing to trade their old feathers in exchange for magical items they can make use of.",
					"Trinket Collectors. Much like the crows they bear a passing similarity with, chronotyryns love to collect shiny objects. Rather than gathering trinkets based solely on how they glitter in the light, chronotyryns collect magic items. They are always adorned in gold and silver finery that often serves a purpose beyond looking nice. Many of the objects worn by these creatures are enchanted to provide some kind of benefit to the chronotyryn. They also make a point to carry an arcane staff with them wherever they go to augment their spells and in some cases allow them access to spells they don't normally have prepared."

					"Humanoid creatures covered in fur with canine heads, the lupin dominate the steppes and forests where their nomadic packs roam. Their culture is built around honour, loyalty, and friendship, but woe be to those who cross them with deception or steel.",
					"Contested Histories. The origin of the lupin race is a topic that not even the lupin themselves can be certain of. The oldest tales of lupin packs speak of a time where the lupin and werewolf races were one and the same, however, the lupin descend from lycanthropes who cast off the chaos of their monthly murderous sprees in order to become somethign more. A sophisticated race, fully in control of both body and mind. Other lupin scholars have more recently proposed a radical theory based on what little written history of the lupin people exists. This new theory suggests that the lupin race came from a union of humans and gnolls, and that early lupins became famed werewolf hunters in order to prove to their fearful human neighbours that they indeed were not werewolves. The objective truth may never be truly known as the vast majority of lupin culture is passed down orally, and therefore the question lingers still.",
					"Werewolf Hunters. Lupins are experts in the field of hunting lycanthropes, specifically, werewolves. The act of hunting and killing werewolves has always been of great significance and bears a nearly spiritual significance amongst the lupin packs. Once a child reaches maturity, they are immediately taken into the fold of lupin hunters and taught the ways of hunting werewolves following an initiation rite known as the Moonset. Werewolves are seen as a mockery of lupin kind. The death and destruction they spread reflects poorly on lupin communities, as many other races often mistake lupins for werewolves from a distance. The murderous tendancies of werewolves also goes directly against the friendly and charitable outlook held by most lupin communities, and as such, werewolves are seen as abominations which must be destroyed.",
					"Nomadic Packs. Lupins typically live in communities consisting of three to fifteen packs consisting of two to twelve individuals (and several pups). These communities practice strict egalitarian democracy and usually operate without an individual leader, though elders in the community can often sway the votes of younger members. Once per year, the overall community selects a representative from among the packs' elders as a spokesperson. This post is only ever held for one year and cannot be selected again until an elder from every other pack in the community has acted as spokesperson.Once per year, the selected spokesperson and any of the youths within the community who wish to go travel to a gathering of other lupin representatives from nearby communities called a White Howl. This White Howl acts as both a meeting for important discussion among the elders and as a chance for young lupins to find companions from outside the community in an effort to intertwine the overall lupin people with bonds of friendship, rivalry, and love. Once the important aspects of the Whit Howl have been attended to, it often turns into a three week long celebration.",
					"The Eternal Flame. Each lupin community is liable to wander within their territory to a degree, however, they do construct villages composed of wooden longhouses typically built in a radial pattern surrounding a public space. In the centre of this space, the lupins maintain a continuous flame known as a bg'tyr. Even when the tribe moves from its village to wander for long periods of time, a single member of the community, usually an adolescent,  always remains behind to tend the flame and ensure it doesn't go out. These individuals are referred to as flame keepers, and often grow up to prominence as one of the lupin communities' spiritual leaders.",
					"Ah'flir. The week of the full moon is an important and sacred time for lupins. During the three days when the moon is brightest, accomplished lupin werewolf hunters (called hruffs) from all the packs in a region gather together and form a temporary pack of their own called an ah'flir. These ah'flir packs have the specific purpose of hunting down and killing as many lycanthropes as possible, especially werewolves."

This instinct to find, absorb, and be surrounded by blood often leads to horrible acts of violence against living creatures that have blood.

					"Heart of the Dungeon. The deepspawn are an enigmatic race of aberrant creatures. They were first discovered in The Underdark, but nobody truly knows exactly what their origin is. Aside from being horrific creatures capable of doling out carnage on the field of battle, they are especially feared for their ability to create perfect copies of creatures they consume. The spawn created by this twisted abomination are one-to-one clones of the original creature and even the most discerning mages find it impossible to differentiate between the two beings. The only difference seems to be that the clones a deepspawn creates are fanatically loyal to their creator. They view an attack on the deepspawn as an attack on themselves and will willingly lay down their lives if it means protecting their aberrant parent. Because of this, many deepspawn populate their lairs with hordes of monsters they have consumed, which can sometimes lead to unexpected ecosystems in an area occupied by a deepspawn.",
					"Varied Armaments. Deepspawn are perfectly capable of wielding any weapon that would typically be used by a humanoid creature. They favor large weapons like greatswords and greataxes, however, they can effectively use any armaments that can be wielded by their tentacles. They also have a limited ability to use magic, which they employ to great effect.",
					"Insidious Schemers. Despite their bestial appearance, deepspawn are incredibly intelligent and patient tacticians. In combat they prefer to let their minions do the fighting. Rather than throwing themselves into harm's way, they deploy their countless spawned agents in the direction of anyone who wishes harm on them. If forced into a situation where combat is inevitable, they bury themselves in rubble or treasure deep within their lair in order to get the drop on the intruders. As intelligent beings they are also not above bargaining if defeat seems inevitable, or if they are dealing with a powerful creature who has something they want.",
					"Hidden Lairs. These massive aberrations prefer to lair in places that are far away from prying eyes. Secluded caves, ancient ruins, and other such desolate areas unlikely to draw much attention are all ideal spots for the deepspawn to live. They typically keep to their own devices, securing power and security for themselves, though sometimes they will send agents to nearby settlements of intelligent creatures to expand their influence and lure victims to the deepspawn's lair. While the creatures can subsist off of any diet, they crave the flesh of intelligent creatures. Often when they consume an intelligent creature they create a spawn of the individual and send them back to the victim's town to take their place. This allows the deepspawn to use them as a spy, and avoid suspicion at the same time.",
					"Copy of a Copy. Over time, the deepspawn's ability to create a spawn of the same creature will slowly deteriorate. Once it has consumed a living organism the first few clones of that creature will be near perfect recreations, however, the more it uses that creature's essence to create a spawn the more slight defects will emerge. Typically the spawn's cognitive abilities are the first place cracks begin to form, until eventually, the spawn is naught but a grotesque imitation of the original."

They reside in the darkest corners of the Shadowfell, only ever shifting to the Material Plane to trade with others or to enact some sort of plan. The fact that they grow tremendous in size when exposed to the light of the sun is largely responsible for them being classified as giants by many scholars who did not fully understand what they were looking at.",

It is the only substance capable of accepting their essence and acting as a sort of egg, in order to propagate the species. To ensure they have a healthy stock of obsidian on hand, shadow giant merchants will travel to the Material Plane with their collection of valuables in order to trade them with mortals for as much obsidian as they can carry. Due to their appearance and notoriety as beings from the Shadowfell, they often avoid large city centres, instead opting for more secluded areas on the outskirts of large cities. The ideal situation for a shadow giant is to arrange an understanding with someone in a position of power to keep regular trade of goods from the Shadowfell flowing in exchange for a steady supply of obsidian they can rely on.",

To   sate this curiosity they will spend the majority of their life shifted into the form of a humanoid creature, living among them, experiencing their culture, and forming true friendships with a great many people. They naturally gravitate towards those who share their curious mind, a preference that typically leads them to places of learning such as colleges, libraries, or other locales that attract scholarly types.

					"Steel dragons are sociable, clever, and curious. They often prefer to navigate the world shapeshifted into the form of a human to learn all they can of humanoid life and customs. The scales of a steel dragon range from a deep blue-grey at birth to a lustrous and burnished steel in adulthood. The brighter the scale's shine, the older the dragon. Their faces are extremely expressive and easily portray their emotions to creatures of other species. They have a wide wingspan with sharp, segmented wings that create the illusion of bundled blades. They also have fine steel spines that grow from their head and neck that raise and lower depending on the dragon's mood. The creature smells of wet metal and moves with feline-like grace.",
					"Curious Minds. Steel dragons are incredibly hard to detect due to their penchant for enjoying humanoid life. They have a deep love and curiosity towards all humanoid lifeforms, especially humans given their relatively adaptive nature. To   sate this curiosity they will spend the majority of their life shifted into the form of a humanoid creature, living among them, experiencing their culture, and forming true friendships with a great many people. They naturally gravitate towards those who share their curious mind, a preference that typically leads them to places of learning such as colleges, libraries, or other locales that attract scholarly types. In exchange for good conversation and a healthy dose of questioning about all manner of things, the dragon will happily share some of its more useful knowledge with unsuspecting friends.",
					"Paragons of Order. Steel dragons are generally good natured, however, they also crave order. To them, the basis of a good civilization is a proper code of laws that are just and upheld with no ambiguity. While these dragons don't typically get involved with the politics of the places they live, they will step in, maintaining their disguise if possible, to guide a city in the right direction or to help in the city's defence against some kind of outside threat. Unlike gold dragons who often seek to hunt down and punish evil doers with zealous fervour, steel dragons are more concerned with the state of their own city and are very unlikely to venture out into the wider world unless convinced there is some kind of threat to the people they are so fond of.",
					"Many Lives. While it may not be peculiar for a dragon to live for several thousand years or more, in the case of even the longest lived humanoid races, the lifespan of a dragon seems nearly infinite. Understanding this, and not wishing to have their true identity compromised, steel dragons in disguise will use their magic to gradually create an illusion that they are ageing, imitating the lifespan of whatever race they masquerade as. Eventually, they may even fake their own death or use some kind of excuse to explain why they are leaving town, never to return, only for the dragon to take on a new persona and arrive back in the same town they love to start all over again. They often transition between identities of various different races and walks of life, however, they always have a telltale sign that indicates their true heritage such as a streak of steel-grey hair, metallic fingernails, or even a steel accessory such as a ring or bangle. To a steel dragon, each new persona is a chance to better understand the people the dragon shares a world with.",
					"Peaceful Titans. Due to the massive amount of power that a steel dragon holds, they almost never resort to violence. Not only would they easily destroy most creatures who threaten them without knowing what they truly are, but the resulting chaos could only serve to harm other people in the area. When pushed into a corner and given no choice, however, a steel dragon will fight tooth and nail to defend its domain and loved ones. They often prefer to use their poisonous gas to knock enemies unconscious rather than simply destroying them.",
					"Unlearned Scholars. Due to the steel dragon's propensity to spend such long periods of time in humanoid form, some scholars and sages have tried to argue that they don't even exist, and instead, that the steel dragon is merely a misidentified silver dragon or perhaps some other kind of metallic creature with draconic ancestry. While these claims are understandable, and in some cases may be true, they only serve to display the care and discretion taken by steel dragons to protect their true identities.",
					"Steel dragons are all too real, and as far as they're concerned the longer they can convince the misinformed scholars of the world they're not, the better."

It's unclear if they originated as a known humanoid species, or if they began life as some other kind of creature, but regardless of their organic origins they have long since moved past the shape nature intended for them to have. By using their knowledge of technology and science, they have taken evolution into their own hands. While they do have semi organic bodies, much of their form is fashioned from metal and other unnatural worked materials. These augmentations give them great strength and keen minds, however, they also make them vulnerable to magic that normally only affects inanimate objects or constructs.",
					"Unnatural Lifecycle. The oard has  a truly strange lifecycle when compared to most other humanoid species. They are not born, but rather grown in tanks specifically fashioned for the development of their young. Once a child has finished its growing phase within the tank, it is gradually \"upgraded\" with all manner of technological improvements until the creature is nearly indistinguishable from the rest of its kind. The longevity of the oard is largely unknown, but sages theorise that they may have no upper age limit given their extremely competent skills with augmentation and technology. It is possible that the final stage of oard life is one where every trace of organic matter has been replaced with machinery and metal.",
					"Time Travelers. The singular mission of oard society seems to be the total domination and assertion of their authority over all creation itself. They attempt to achieve this goal by travelling through time in order to change historical events in subtle ways that will better suit the schemes of the oard in the long run. They are able to do this by utilising their time travel mirrors, devices that allow a creature to step over a threshold and into the past. This trip is a one way ordeal, however, so any creature that uses such a device is unable to return to the present. As a result, members of oard civilization can be found across all periods of history."

Their body is covered in a coat of extremely small and thin metallic scales that are smooth, flat, and difficult to discern individually. This lends to the illusion that the creature's body is a single smooth, reflective, surface. At birth, a mercury dragon has scales that are a dull silver, but as they mature their scales become brighter and more reflective until eventually reaching a brilliant mirror-like finish.",
					"Unhinged Nature. While generally leaning towards good, mercury dragons host an extremely volatile disposition. They are incredibly unpredictable and are known to act on any impulse as it may arise. Easily distracted, they often shift focus from one task to another while in the middle of doing something. They are also known to completely change the subject of conversation in the middle of speaking, a quirk that makes the fast talking dragons even more difficult to follow at times. Mercury dragons are as unpredictable when it comes to combat as they are in any other situation. They may parley, they might attack instantly, or, perhaps, they may avoid combat entirely. They will, however, never attack creatures they believe have good intentions unless sorely provoked.",
					"Mercury dragons like to make their lairs in places that share their ever-changing an unpredictable nature. Volcanoes, fault lines, and areas where the weather is chaotic are all possible locations a mercury dragon might choose to call home. Active volcanoes are a particular favourite as they provide the creature with a defensible location to call home that is inhospitable to most life. They enjoy tunnelling into the volcanic vents and relaxing as lava washes over them, cleansing any dirt or other impurities which helps keep their scales bright and shiny.",
					"Mercury dragons are avid collectors of fine trinkets and treasures, but generally don't collect any one particular type of object. Their horde of treasure is likely to contain a wide variety of treasure and magic items, as well as a vast collection of seemingly random objects that the dragon claims to be valuable or of some esoteric function. They are not particularly good at organising their lairs, so even finding a specific object in the disorganised heap can be an adventure in and of itself. They are fond of trading, however, and will often part with some of their horde in order to see new objects of interest added to it, especially if they can trade away duplicates of something they already have. Notably, their horde doesn't contain many piles of similar coin. Once the dragon has collected a single coin from a particular kingdom or country, it sees no need to have more than one of the same coin and would rather seek out currency of different shapes, sizes, and material from other places."

					"Living Bridges. Spanners are living, intelligent, stone bridges. Nobody knows where these creatures first originated, but most scholars believe they began as mimics who were altered by arcane magic and twisted into the form of a bridge. They likely served as guardians and sentries for their creator's lair. Since then though, spanners have migrated through the countryside and spread far and wide the world over. They are known to come in all shapes and sizes, sometimes as a relatively small stone bridge across a brook, other times as a massive stone connector bridging impossibly long gaps. Nobody knows how, or if, they reproduce, but the assumption is that once a single individual reaches a massive size, they split into two separate entities and go their own way. ",
					"Gossiping Infrastructure. These creatures are of average intelligence and fully capable of communicating with spoken word. They have a low, gravelly voice that rumbles the rest of the creature's body while they speak. Spanners love to listen in on what those walking across their back have to say. They are particularly fond of good gossip and stories about far off lands. While most spanners are content to lay idle for years at a time, some specimens are more outspoken and actively prevent creatures from walking over them unless they can provide the spanner with an interesting tale or bit of information. ",
					"Protective by Nature. Spanners have no natural end to their lifespan, and as such, will sometimes stay in one place for hundreds of years if the locale is to their liking. Those that are of more social inclination often form relationships with people who cross them regularly. A spanner that provides transport over a river in and out of a small town is liable to know all the merchants, hunters, guardsmen, or anyone else that comes and goes from town frequently. Even if the creature chooses to keep its true nature hidden, it likely knows a lot about the people in town due to its interest in listening to others as they walk across it. This can make them a valuable source of information. Spanners also take great lengths to protect those it cares about from harm. Bandits seeking to cross the spanner in order to raid a village on the other side might find the bridge actively fighting back or simply moving to prevent their crossing. They also seem to have a soft spot for wildlife, freely allowing animals to cross their bodies, and punishing poachers or other individuals it sees as abusive to the natural world. "

					"Before you stands a draconic creature reminiscent of a true dragon, but twisted with dark fey magic. A singular orange orb occupies a massive eye socket in the middle of this creature's head, pushing its two smaller vestigial eyes to either side. Its scales are a mottled medley of brown and yellow hues. Surrounding the creature is an air of the arcane, and as the creature draws breath, you feel a chill run down your spine. ",
					"Fey Magic. Hag dragons are created by powerful hag covens. The hags enact a ritual using a dragon egg of any variety to create a twisted abomination much more dangerous than any true dragon. Once the ritual is complete, the egg hatches and a hag dragon wyrmling is born. It may have some features reminiscent of the dragon egg's original species, but they are simply a vestigial remnant of the creature's original form.",
					"Timeless. Unlike other dragons, hag dragons do not age with the passage of time. They would theoretically remain as wyrmlings forever if it weren't for the uncanny magical abilities they possess. Hag dragons can only grow up by absorbing the remaining years of other creatures. By making use of their breath weapon, they not only cause other creatures to age rapidly, but allow themselves to grow incredibly fast. Unlike many other creatures, dragons only seem to get more powerful as they age, so as the hag dragon increases its age it becomes incredibly dangerous in a short amount of time. Many hags seek to exploit this trait by keeping hag dragons young and easy to control, however, once a hag dragon is capable of breaking free from its creators it often does so in violent fashion if it was not treated with respect. ",
					"Covens. While hag dragons are incredibly rare, it has been theorised that should a group of them ever come together and agree to cooperate, they could form a coven. In much the same way a group of hags in a  coven become powerful in the extreme, a coven of hag dragons would surely be capable of casting earth shattering rituals. Should such a coven ever arise, it could spell doom for entire kingdoms if left unchecked."

					"Loners. Reef giants live in solitude for the majority of their lifespan. They enjoy the peace and quiet that comes  with carving out your own spot in the world. They make their homes on tropical islands, on the seafloor, and in large reefs teeming with sea life. Though they tend to live in obscurity, they do not live in squalor. Reef giants construct and live within colossal mansions large enough to house them comfortably in luxury. They make sure to take time for relaxation and enjoyment of life as a point, making sure to avoid being involved with politics and other such petty endeavours. As such, they are completely exempt from the ordning, opting not to participate in giant culture beyond their own. ",
					"Monogamous Lovers. While unjoined, reef giants may live a lonely life, should they find a partner and fall in love, they mate for life. When two reef giants find one another to be suitable companions, they merge what riches and other assets they have and live their life of luxury together. Should the pair ever produce children, upon reaching adulthood, all but the eldest daughter leave the giant's estate to claim their own corner of the ocean. Traditionally, the eldest daughter remains with her parents to care for them as they pass into old age, and eventually to the afterlife, however, such service doesn't come without reward. Upon the passing of her final parent, all riches and estate owned by her parents pass on to the ownership and care of the eldest daughter to do with as she pleases. Such an eligible bachelorette often attracts suitors from the surrounding area, who are welcomed to make their case for partnership. Reef giants are notoriously picky, unwilling to settle for anything less than exactly what they want, and this attitude also extends to their choice of companion. In many cases the eldest daughter may simply exchange her assets for treasure and take up a life of adventure before finding a place to call her own. ",
					"Strange Wanderers. Many reef giants are content to simply live out their long lives in a paradise of their own creation, however, there are always those among them that wish to see more of the world before settling down. Such individuals often find work as sailors, though only the largest seafaring vessels can manage to take them aboard. Those that choose a simple life are often able to grind out a living by taking various treasures and oddities from the seafloor to market for trade, using the gold they earn to pay for materials and other luxuries they can't find themselves in the ocean."

On either side of the monster is a spindly arm which it seems to flap up and down uncontrollably, as if trying to fly. ",
					"Walking Eggs. Known among sages as the alkada, and to everyone else as the wingless wonder, these mysterious creatures baffle even the most learned scholars. They are extremely simple minded and seem utterly inept at defending themselves in the wild. This has made encountering a wingless wonder a rare event, due to the fact that very few of them survive anywhere other creatures are plentiful. Their poisonous flesh does keep most predators at bay, however, this does not stop many of the humanoid creatures they encounter from attacking them on sight, presuming that they pose some kind of threat. Though in some places, they are known to be harmless by the population and are simply left to their devices.",
					"Fearless Explorers. Fear is not an instinct that exists within the wingless wonder. Neither is common sense. Wonders explore the world around them with a shy fascination that leads them down just about any path they find themselves on. They are utterly fascinated by shiny objects such as gemstones and reflective surfaces, and will happily place such things in their mouth, located at the centre of their massed tentacles. Though these objects provide no sustenance to the creature, they enjoy collecting them nonetheless. ",
					"Egg Baskets. The wingless wonder carries around anywhere between one and a dozen alkada eggs at any given time. When meeting another of its kind, the two may fertilise the eggs carried by one another. An alkada carries a fertilised egg for six months before placing it on the ground, whereupon it hatches instantly. The young alkada follow their parent for a time, but mature rapidly before going their own way. ",
					"Trapped Wizards. Approximately a quarter of all wingless wonders wandering the land are actually transformed humanoid creatures, many of which were wizards or spellcasters of some kind. They are the result of a trend among wizards where rather than simply killing your enemy at the end of an arcane duel, the winner would trap the defeated in wonder form using a spell called {@spell Thaelur's Wonder|dungeondadstatblocks}. This was widely seen as a fate worse than death and may also be the true origin of the alkada species. Being trapped as a wingless wonder is a maddening experience, only elongated by the fact that alkada don't seem to have an upper limit on their natural lives, only dying when slain by another creature or their own stupidity."

						"A 10-foot-radius sphere of antimagic surrounds the wonder. Within the sphere, spells can't be cast, summoned creatures disappear, and magic items become mundane. Spells and other magical effects, except those created by an artifact or a deity or a casting of dispel magic or remove curse, are suppressed in the sphere and can't protrude into it. A slot expended to cast a suppressed spell is consumed. While an effect is suppressed, it doesn't function, but the time it spends suppressed counts against its duration. Spells and other magical effects, such as magic missile and charm person, that target a creature or an object in the sphere have no effect on that target. The area of another spell or magical effect, such as fireball, can't extend into the sphere. If the sphere overlaps an area of magic, the part of the area that is covered by the sphere is suppressed. For example, the flames created by a wall of fire are suppressed within the sphere, creating a gap in the wall if the overlap is large enough. Any active spell or other magical effect on a creature or an object in the sphere is suppressed while the creature or object is in it. The properties and powers of magic items are suppressed in the sphere. For example, a +1 longsword in the sphere functions as a nonmagical longsword. A magic weapon's properties and powers are suppressed if it is used against a target in the sphere or wielded by an attacker in the sphere. If a magic weapon or a piece of magic ammunition fully leaves the sphere (for example, if you fire a magic arrow or throw a magic spear at a target outside the sphere), the magic of the item ceases to be suppressed as soon as it exits.  Teleportation and planar travel fail to work in the sphere, whether the sphere is the destination or the departure point for such magical travel. A portal to another location, world, or plane of existence, as well as an opening to an extradimensional space such as that created by the rope trick spell, temporarily closes while in the sphere. A creature or object summoned or created by magic temporarily winks out of existence in the sphere. Such a creature instantly reappears once the space the creature occupied is no longer within the sphere. Spells and magical effects such as dispel magic have no effect on the sphere. Likewise, the spheres created by different antimagic field spells don't nullify each other."

While extremely rare, young platinum dragons tend to wander the world until they have amassed sufficient wisdom and knowledge of the plane they inhabit before settling down. Their lairs are generally quite spartan compared to other dragons as they do not horde physical objects, but rather collect great deeds. Each platinum dragon keeps in its lair a tremendous scroll or tapestry that details its actions throughout the creature's life. Often this scroll and its records are kept from before the time of the dragon's ascension. "

Despite their innate desire for chaos, a trait reflected by their behaviour as well as their ever-shifting form, these aberrant entities are actually quite intelligent and capable of tactics well beyond most people's initial estimations.

Once a tungsten dragon reaches maturity, they may choose to remain with their family, or go off to settle a lair and potentially start a family of their own, but even if they do choose to leave, their family will still welcome them home at any time should they choose to reunite for any reason. This community driven nature of tungsten dragons has allowed them to exist in some of the most unforgiving places the world has to offer. Those who know of their familial nature always think twice before taking action against a tungsten dragon, and those who don't seldom live to regret that choice.",

Their actual lairs are usually in rocky caves, though when no such locale is available they will settle for making a home deep underground."

					"In its true form the pie fiend is a burly devil with massive bat-wings, cloven hooves, a pair of horns, and razor sharp teeth. They are often dressed in a thick leather apron which serves to protect their large belly. Unlike other devils, they smell not of smoke and brimstone, but of cinnamon and pastry. ",
					"Grudging Respect. Pie fiends are one of the strangest creatures to ever emerge from the hells, so strange in fact that some scholars believe them to be mere myth, nothing more than a joke exchanged between the learned. In reality, they are all too real, and it would behoove those who value their souls to take them seriously. Even other devils understand the power held by an accomplished pie fiend, and while they may make jokes about them in private, they are compelled to show these devils respect, lest they face the wrath of their superior.",
					"Bakery of Souls. Like all devils who operate within The Nine Hells, pie fiends trade and barter in souls. They are highly intelligent, and master manipulators. Using their ability to take on the form of humanoid creatures to influence mortals seems to be their primary method of harvesting souls, afterall, one is much more likely to let their guard down around the kindly old woman who bakes delicious pies than they are around a bonafide devil from beyond the Material Plane. They often set up bakeries in small towns and then use their standing with the townsfolk to sway events one way or another in their favor. Occasionally they will even establish themselves in large cities, working in conjunction with other devils to bring the populace to its knees through the art of baking cursed confections. It is said that pie fiends are capable of baking sweets so incredible that a mortal might be tempted to trade their soul simply to have a second bite, and even if they don't get a soul out of the deal, it can at least provide the pie fiend with an unparalleled distraction. ",
					"Sweet Tooth. Unsurprisingly, pie fiends have a sweet tooth that would make even the most decadent noble blush. They love sweets, especially baked goods, and often go out of their way to acquire such things whenever the opportunity arises. They are exceptionally fond of baked treats that are made with unfamiliar methods, such as those from cultures not encountered by the fiend or a particular baker's specialty. They not only savor the flavor of these confections, but they also make sure to either find or figure out the recipe of any delectable dessert they come across in their recipe book. Every pie fiend's prize possession is their infernal tome of desert recipes. Each one contains all the desserts, both magical and mundane, that particular pie fiend knows how to make. The possibility of adding to this recipe book is often a driving force in any given pie fiend's actions. "

While she cuts the silhouette of a beautiful humanoid creature, it's impossible to see any surface area of her physical body due to the shroud of pure white cloth that flows to-and-fro as if caught in an omnidirectional breeze. As the woman hovers into the air, she speaks with a voice, quiet as a whisper, but with the authority to move mountains. ",
					"Mother of Demons. Pale Night very well might be the oldest creature currently living within The Abyss, and possibly even the multiverse itself. There is much conflicting information about this enigmatic demoness, though one thing is certain, she is feared by all, even other demons. Pale Night is an Obyrith, a species of demon that is all but extinct. During their time in power, an age long before the first mortal drew breath, the Obryiths were the uncontested masters of The Abyss. As their ambition grew, eventually, they were hunted relentlessly by the Eladrin and other celestials intent on purging their dark influence from the multiverse. Despite this, Pale Night survived. She chose to bide her time, lurking in unseen places, methodically plotting her next move. Many believe it was Pale Night that gave rise to the first among the current population of demons living within The Abyss. She is said to be the mother of Graz'zt, among several other demon lords.",
					"Veiled Madness. Pale Night's true form is something so horrific, so unbelievably wrong, that reality itself simply rejects her appearance. The veil that covers her entire body is a magical and cosmic effect put in place by the laws of the multiverse in order to prevent her from spilling out and corrupting everything around her. She is able to temporarily suppress this veil, however, it takes a tremendous amount of willpower meaning it is only possible to do so for mere moments. Some scholars believe the veil itself is some kind of divine being that came to be as a response to Pale Night's presence, however, this is still a subject of much debate. Most creatures who lay eyes upon her true form die instantly, and those who survive find it impossible to describe what they've seen. In many cases their memory simply lapses due to the fact that their brain is incapable of rationalising whatever it is that lies beyond the veil, and those who do retain even minor, inconsequential bits of information are typically rendered completely mad. ",
					"Winds of Change. The way Pale Night might react to an intruder within her realm is nearly impossible to predict. She is capricious and prone to flights of fancy that don't seem to follow any observable pattern. Sometimes she considers the mere act of a mortal speaking to her to be a sin worth of painful destruction. Other times, she seems completely aloof, and rarely, she even enjoys conversation with others, sending them on errands that typically involve the death of an enemy or rival demon in The Abyss. Whether this is just her chaotic nature as a demon lord made manifest, or the result of some unknown insight Pale Night possesses, it makes her a volatile entity to interact with. ",
					"Silent Cults. Like all demon lords, Pale Night has cultists on the Material Plane that worship her as a god. Unlike most other demon lords, she doesn't seek out or even interact with any of her cultists with almost no exception. Cults of Pale Night are typically focused on gaining access to her domain so that they might present themselves as humble servants to act in her service. Many cultists fantasise about being wrapped in her shroud and transformed into a shrouded knight in their lady's service. ",
					"Madness of Pale Night",

					"Gargantuan Scholars. Eclipse giants truly live up to their namesake in size alone. These creatures are so tremendous that they make even the mighty storm giants look small by comparison. They average approximately forty feet in height and can weigh upwards of thirty-thousand pounds. Many onlookers first assume that due to their apparent bulk and towering physique the giants are mere brutes who rely on strength alone, but that couldn't be further from the truth. Eclipse giants are wanderers at heart who seek to understand the deepest esoteric secrets the world has to offer. This often gets them in trouble, or at least causes troubles for others, as their preoccupied minds tend to notice little else around them beyond the subject of their ponderings which can result in the oblivious destruction of whatever finds itself underfoot. ",
					"Marked By The Cosmos. The body of an eclipse giant is marked by numerous tattoos that depict various celestial bodies and star charts. These tattoos can carry many different meanings. Some are a representation of the night sky during an important event in the giant's life such as a great victory in battle, the discovery of something fantastic, or the birth of a child. Others are literal maps encoded in the stars that someone with significant knowledge in astronomy could use to chart a path. Such tattoos typically lead to a location important to the giant's culture that is passed on through the generations. Some say these tattoos grant the giants power over life and death, though to the giants this power is more representative of life's cycles than anything resembling simple necromancy. ",

During an eclipse of any kind the \"true self\" of every eclipse giant is unlocked. While the giant's \"true self\" is active they can access a part of their innermost being that is normally kept dormant. Some eclipse giants enter a violent frenzy, becoming nearly unkillable arbiters of death and destruction. Another might begin manically putting pen to parchment, creating written works of art that will define their culture for generations, all while another might be granted vast understanding of the cosmos and temporarily gain the capacity to quickly solve a complex astronomical formula that may have taken years to interpret otherwise. The \"true self\" of each eclipse giant is different, but it is something they all seek to access as frequently as possible and therefore the prediction of a coming eclipse is of the greatest importance to their species as a whole.

					"The small humanoid creature before you is reminiscent of a goblin, though its limbs stretch well beyond a goblin's proportions, and it boasts a robust physique that indicates it as no stranger to tests of strength. Its skin is a deep purple, lined with black stripes. Its face is almost bat-like with a wide maw filled with sharp, tightly packed teeth. The creature's massive ears ever so slightly twitch and shutter, as though it is listening to myriad sounds imperceptible to most.",
					"BORN TO DIE. Vril are the result of intergenerational experimentation on goblins conducted by insidious Drow Elf wizards. The idea was to raise up a species of goblin that could act as a powerful caste of minions for their schemes, with the intent of using them as loyal shock troops and guards for areas outside the city. While the brutal training and rigorous experimentation certainly managed to yield results, the vril would quickly prove to be much more independent than the wizards could imagine. ",
					"ROGUE SPECIES. Some Vril still work at the behest of their creators, due in part to the fact that they were genetically modified with magic making them  vulnerable to poison, a tool which their creators have access to in abundance. Despite this setback, the majority of Vril have since escaped the purpose originally intended for their species and have found themselves decidedly acclimated to life in The Underdark. Using their extremely sharp sense of hearing to navigate the cavernous geography of The Underdark, and their powerful shrieks  as a method of communication over vast distances, few vril can control wide areas of territory with relative ease.",
					"THOUGHTFUL COMBATANTS. Unlike standard goblins, Vril approach most problems with an inquisitive mind, and a level of situational awareness that even Hobgoblins can't help but admire. They will always try to observe an opponent and attempt to glean what kind of weaponry they are using before engaging with an enemy. This helps ensure that they can make proper use of their skinshift ability in order to shrug off strikes that would otherwise see them dead. They are fond of ambush tactics as well, making use of their powerful shrieks before jumping into battle with vicious intent. How the Vril fit in with the other goblinoid races still has yet to be seen, though some scholars believe they may possess the strength of both body and mind to challenge the Hobgoblins for dominance, and if they should manage to find common ground and cooperation, the enemies of goblinkind are bound to wind up in deep trouble.",
					"BLOODSWORN. Some vril have taken to dabbling in magic of their own, using it to rid themselves of the vulnerabilities thrust upon them by their creators. It is unclear precisely where the first bloodsworm came from, but many scholars believe these special members of vril society have entered into a collective pact with a more powerful entity. It is possible that this entity is Maglubiyet himself, the god of all goblins, and that this pact serves as not just a boon to the vril, but also as a formal vow of fealty to the god of goblinoids. Yet it is also possible that they have fond communion with some other entity, currently unknown to the wider world, and that they now serve a much darker purpose on behalf of something supremely sinister.

					"BORN OF THE LAND. Like many fey creatures, ruin chanters are spirits born of the land they occupy. Rather than being brought to life by the latent energy of an ancient forest or forgotten mountain, ruin chanters are made manifest by immense sadness, loss, and a profound sense of solitude. They are melancholic spirits who seek to preserve the dormant memories that lay trapped within aged ruins and abandoned places. They subsist on a diet of ash and dust, and they sleep on a bed of rubble. To them, these things are not only acceptable, but enjoyable. ",
					"ANCIENT PLACES. Ruin chanters can be found anywhere that once held life, but is now abandoned for one reason or another. Lost cities, ancient temples, and toppled fortresses are all among their favourite haunts. They protect these places with an unblinking vigilance. They care little about things happening outside of their domain, and will be openly hostile towards anyone they believe is seeking to raid their home for treasure. Such encounters usually end in death for the intruders, though the chanter typically won't cause undue suffering. They will simply do whatever they must to return the ruin to a state of undisturbed silence as fast as possible. If another creature enters the chanter's ruin with good intentions and conducts themselves with respect, the chanter may be willing to converse with them, and is very unlikely to attack unprovoked. ",
					"RESTORATION. Ruin chanters will abide the presence of any constructs, undead, or other creatures who naturally occupy their home. They will also tolerate creatures who enter the ruins with intent to restore or maintain them in some way, often making themselves known and actively cooperating with such individuals. They also seek out other ruin chanters for companionship, though such meetings are rare, and territory between chanter's is always respected. They communicate with one another over vast distances using esoteric songs sung in Sylvan. ",
					"MAGIC ITEMS",
					"Many ruin chanters have found powerful magic items within the places they inhabit. Consider what magic items a ruin chanter may have discovered in the ruin which it occupies, and consider adding them to the creature's stat block. Just keep in mind any items the creature is carrying may be looted by adventurers who best the creature in combat. "
