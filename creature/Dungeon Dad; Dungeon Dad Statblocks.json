Their entire culture is built atop the knowledge and whispered secrets they have glimpsed in the great beyond.",

Though they are normally placid scholars, more likely to enter a lively philosophical debate with other creatures than a brawl, moon giants can become violent when disturbed or when under the influence of a bad moon. There is something truly powerful about their connection to the moon and its cycles, and much is still unknown about how these complex systems directly affect the giants attuned with them.",

They often use magic to induce sleep in themselves for long periods of time, during which they are able to travel to the plane of dreams and explore many strange places. These journeys are usually aided by clerics of the moon giant faith, and in some cases can last decades.",

					"Plush golems are constructs crafted to look like large stuffed animals. They can take a  wide variety of shapes and come in many different colors, however, one thing always remains true. If anyone should threaten their owner, there will be hell to pay.",
					"The Gift That Keeps Giving. Plush golems are every parent's worst nightmare. They are typically given as gifts to young children, usually by obnoxious aunts or uncles. Plush golems seem like ordinary stuffed animals at first to most, but eventually reveal their animated state of being to the children who own them. As most children tend to treat their toy animals more like live creatures than playthings, it can become extremely frustrating for some parents as the child insists that the toy be allowed to eat at the dinner table, go along on outings, and take part in other family activities.",
					"Artisanal Playthings. Plush golems are finely crafted stuffed animals and may be formed from velvet, cotton, or wool. They are usually stuffed with cotton batting, but are sometimes partly filled with dried beans. They may be created in realistic colors to represent a real bear, panda, lion, or tiger, or they may be fabricated into fantastic creatures such as pink elephants, purple rabbits, or lime green monkeys.",
					"Fierce Guardians. While they are built to be soft and friendly, if the owner of a plush golem is ever threatened, the creature will spring into action and fight mercilessly to defend its master. Plush golems are often an unforeseen line of defense against would-be burglars, kidnappers, or other criminals. This makes them an ideal companion for children born into noble houses as they provide more protection than a mere bodyguard, and are often underestimated as simple toys."

					"YELLOW DRAGONS",
					"Selfish and cunning, yellow dragons hold dominion over seaside cliffs, salt flats, and coastal marshes. They are secretive and elusive in the extreme, opting to take a clever and subtle approach to problem solving rather than relying solely on draconic might. A yellow dragon is easily recognized by its elongated narrow jaws, oversized claws, and its slender body. Yellow dragons vary in color from brilliant hues of sunny yellow to flaxen shades of wheat. Their scales are much smaller than that of a typical dragon and are constantly being replaced, giving their skin a texture more akin to a snake than a lizard. This smooth scale pattern also allows them to more easily navigate through water and dirt.",
					"The Missing Dragons. Ancient lore holds true that all the chromatic dragons were born from Tiamat, the queen of dragons. The more common varieties of chromatic dragon (white, black, red, green, and blue) were all made in the image of their mother, who has a draconic head of each color. However, there are other varieties of chromatic dragon that have a more mysterious origin. Purple, orange, and yellow dragons did not originate from Tiamat, but they certainly do exist. This quandary has divided scholars for ages, but there are two prevalent theories about their origin. Some think Tiamat may have experimented with her children before unleashing them upon the world, trying to create even stronger breeds. Secondary-color crossbreeds could have bred true with each other, starting new branches of the dragon family tree. Sages also speculate as to the possibility of another chromatic dragon deity, Tiamat's sister perhaps, arrayed with heads of yellow, orange, purple, and other crossbred colors. Tiamat may have destroyed her sibling eons ago, but not before the creation of dragons in the image of their deceased progenitor.",
					"Selfish. Yellow dragons are incredibly selfish, even by the standards of other chromatic dragons. Many scholars believe the primary reason they have become so obscure is due to the fact that during the war waged by dragons against the giants, the yellow dragons offered no help. In fact, yellow dragons were said to remove themselves from the conflict entirely, not willing to risk their lives for the benefit of their kind. This led to them being reviled by other dragons and ultimately to the destruction of many yellow dragon lands. To this day, the yellow dragons keep to themselves, knowing that should they ever make their presence known they will be surrounded by enemies.",
					"Cunning Trappers. Unlike most other dragons, even in their oldest stages of life, the yellow dragon prefers to use ambush tactics and traps when engaging in battle. They are not as physically powerful as some of their other draconic cousins, but yellow dragons are extremely fast and capable of traveling through water, sand, and rock with relative ease. They use this unique mobility to their utmost advantage and will only ever take a fight they know will end in victory. A favorite trap of theirs is to dig a cone-shaped pit with steep sides, then bury themselves at the bottom. When prey inevitably stumbles into such a trap, the yellow dragon then moves its wings, causing the pit to collapse.",
					"Isolationist. Due to the fact that yellow dragons are hated by most for being dragons, and hated by other dragons for their actions throughout history, they have become quite isolated. They speak a strange dialect of Draconic unique to yellow dragons and will typically not learn any other languages since they have no desire to communicate with anyone outside of their own kind. This adds another layer of complexity to encountering a yellow dragon. If an individual approaches without an understanding of their language, even if they use magic such as the tongues spell to communicate, the yellow dragon is unlikely to trust or respect them."

The only way to remove the curse is the casting of a remove curse spell or equivalent during the victim's slumber while they are plagued with nightmares.

					"{@b {@i Beware the Bagman.}} Some say \"The Bagman\" is merely an urban legend. One version of the story tells of an adventurer who sought to escape certain death by abandoning his companions and hiding inside a bag of holding. Later, when he tried to leave the bag, he became lost amid a constantly increasing number of extra dimensional storage spaces. Over time, the strange forces of this magical in-between place transformed the adventurer into a monstrous creature. Now, every night, The Bagman slips out from a random bag of holding. If he doesn't find his home, he drags someone back into the bag with him and leaves behind some trinket from his hidden kingdom of lost junk. Some say that if you speak too loudly over an open bag of holding or whisper \"follow my voice\" into a magical storage space, space three times, The Bagman will come for you. Whether this is the true genesis of the bagman or not, the fact remains that a bagman is a very real threat, and a fate worse than death awaits those dragged into the realm from which they hail.",
					"{@b {@i \"Men\", Not \"Man\".}} The myth of The Bagman would suggest that there is only one \"Bagman\", however, the reality is much more sinister. When a bagman comes through a bag of holding into the material world, it does so in an attempt to find its way back to wherever it originally came from. When it is unsuccessful in finding its home, the creature always attempts to drag another sentient creature back with it into the bizarre realm it calls home, the \"Space Between Spaces\". If its kidnapping attempt is successful, it will typically abandon the creature before long as it continues its quest to find a way back home. Creatures who don't make it back to the material world will find themselves slowly twisted into a new bagman, destined to the same nightly ritual of obsessively trying to find their way back to where they came from. Why bagmen kidnap creatures is a mystery. Some scholars posit that it is a twisted reflex. That maybe they recognize their own perverse nature and a part of them hopes to be delivered from their predicament by somebody with their mind still intact. Others believe they do so at the behest of a dark entity, an unknown evil that is responsible for the creation of the first bagman who uses them as a means to gather twisted subordinates for some scheme that is yet to be revealed.",
					"{@b {@i The Space Between Spaces.}} For ages it was thought that the space inside a bag of holding was a self contained one, completely separate from the rest of the multiverse, but this is not so. All of these spaces are mere fragments of a much larger plane which scholars refer to as the \"Space Between Spaces\". Every extra-dimensional space such as that found within a bag of holding or portable hole connects to an isolated fragment of this bizarre demi-plane, but for the bagmen and other creatures native to the \"Space Between Spaces\", a bag of holding is not an isolated area, but a gateway to and from the material world. It is unclear if the first magic user to create a bag of holding truly knew what they were doing. Did they know they were linking our world with a nearly empty one governed by monsters? Or perhaps they never stopped to think that there might be something lurking on the other side.",

					"GRISGOL",
					"This humanoid figure is wrapped from head to toe in strips of scroll parchment and pages from dusty tomes. Pieces of tattered magic belts, robes, and chainmail also seem haphazardly integrated into its form.",
					"Living Hordes. A grisgol is a horrifying construct composed of broken and worn-out magic items, animated by a powerful spellcaster who has harnessed the spirit of a lich. Its skeleton is fabricated from old staffs and wands and its skin from expended scrolls wrapped about it like a mummy's burial cloth. Woven into this are rings, bracers, fragments of leather or chainmail, and the like. Inside the creature are scores of half-empty vials of potions, unguents, and oils, vaguely resembling sets of internal organs. It typically wears a rune-scribed cloak or robe. Pinpoints of red light glare from underneath a hood or old helmet.",
					"Heart of Darkness. Nestled inside the construct, among miscellaneous junk, is the original lich's phylactery. Unless one knows what animates a grisgol, the phylactery appears as another piece of spent magic trash tossed loosely and randomly into the insides of the construct.",
					"Mistaken Identity. From a distance, a grisgol appears to be a mummy, even moving with a similar stiff gait. When it walks, one can hear the tinkling of glass touching glass, the sloshing of half-filled vials and bottles, the squeaking of leather, the rubbing of wood and bone against each other, and, most prominently, the shuffling of paper as if pages of a tome were caught in a slight breeze. Thin tendrils of black smoke escape from cracks in its body. A grisgol leaves a sooty, oily residue upon whatever it touches.",
					"Lich's Power. A grisgol is in every way a magic construct, possessing all traits native to golems in addition to the abilities of the lich that powers it. A grisgol's damaging and paralysing touch attacks are drawn from the lich's soul within and the construct retains a fraction of the original lich's spell-casting ability. A grisgol only casts the spells scribed by its creator on the scrolls and tome pages that make up its outer skin. Destroying a grisgol does not destroy the lich that powers it. To kill the lich, its phylactery must be destroyed after the grisgol is destroyed. Otherwise, the lich is free to return in a physical form in 1d10 days. The escaped lich retains all the powers and abilities it had previous to its entrapment. The lich seeks vengeance upon whoever possesses its phylactery and the wizard, sorcerer, or cleric who originally entrapped it in the body of a grisgol.",
					"Programmed Fighters. A grisgol is tenacious and relentless, following its creator's instructions explicitly without regard to strategy. Therefore, a grisgol's spell usage is often scripted ahead of time by its creator, unless its creator is within 60 feet of the golem and is able to issue commands.",
					"Construction. A grisgol's body is a haphazard collection of old magic wands, staffs, potions, miscellaneous items, and, most importantly, scraps of scrolls and magic tomes. This costs approximately 10,000 GP. Assembling the body requires a DC 20 Arcana check and a {@item manual of golems||manual of golem creation}.",
					"Mercenary Gear. Grisgols are often cobbled together by fledgling magic users that happen upon enough magic infused trash to craft themselves a golem. This means that the end result, a grisgol, is typically sold off as a weapon or tool to those with the need for such things. Because of this, a grisgol might end up with a wide array of different spells, all based on what spell scrolls were available to the creator, but also tailored according to the client's needs. A mercenary band might request a grisgol with healing spells or powerful long range magic. The creation of grisgol's is banned in many kingdoms, as it typically doesn't serve the rulership to have magic items left unaccounted for, especially if those magic items are being used by potential rebels orother groups that pose a threat to the stability of a region."

A city corruptor is not a punishment for a people's lack of moral fortitude; it is a consequence. A natural predator of the urban environment, the city corruptor stalks the dark streets that are the arteries of the city it feeds on. As the city's weak and vulnerable begin to die in increasing numbers, this foul demon spreads fear among even the most powerful.",
					"Demonic Predation.  City corruptors appear in desperate, depraved, or hopeless urban centres. Places where the people either cannot reverse the moral decay of their city, or where they do not care to. A city corruptor is not attracted to combat. Rather, the demon lusts after the blood of victims lost to an environment shifting closer to collapse each day. To hasten the destruction of such an environment is every city corruptor's ultimate delight.",
					"The Portal Alignment. These sly demons first appeared in Zelatar, spreading quickly to other abyssal settlements. As a mortal city decays, the nature of an abyssal city aligns with it, and a city corruptor can step through the newly created gateway. Only one demon passes through during such an alignment. City corruptors fight among themselves for the exclusive right to claim a city in the mortal realm. Once a city is claimed, the corruptor gets to work. In the event that the city falls in its entirety, many of its people are sure to be dead, and the survivors along with the city itself are dragged into the Abyss, leaving behind a barren and lifeless dead spot in the Material Plane.",
					"Dead Spots. A dead spot is what gets left behind when a city is pulled into the Abyss. The dead spot appears as a soot-covered patch of land that always seems to be in the shade, even on the brightest day. It encompasses the entire area where the city was as well as the surrounding three miles. Nothing can or ever will grow in this place again. Dead spots are intrinsically linked to the Abyss, and as such, are often sought out by cultists and summoners who wish to draw on the power of demons. The only way to remove them is to sever the link by travelling to the Abyss, finding the demon responsible for the city's downfall, and killing them.",
					"Demonic Kingpins. A city corruptor's primary means of achieving its goal is to wage a campaign of terror to destroy a city from within. They are extremely charismatic and will not hesitate to draw on their overwhelmingly magnetic personality traits to amass minions such as murderers, assassins, thieves, and other supernatural urban predators such as wererats or doppelgangers. When other demons come into the picture, however, the city corrupter refuses to share its plans with them as it seeks to be glorified as the only demon involved."

					"Moon dragons are evil dragons that typically inhabit caves on moons. Like most dragons, they prize wealth and power. The coloration of moon dragons changes every 30 days, starting out as brilliant white. Slowly, what appears to be a large black shadow forms on the dragon's left side, and gradually moves across the beast until it is all black. This process takes 15 days, whereupon a small sliver of white appears on the left side and moves across the dragon until, 15 days later, it is all white again. The dragon's strength and alignment vary with its coloration. Each \"phase\" lasts seven days. When the dragon is all black, it is at full strength and lawful evil. When either black-white or white-black, its alignment is neutral evil. When all white, it is chaotic evil. When the moon dragon is all white, it holds sway over lycanthropes, and can even force them into their animalistic form."

To the astronomer, it may be a fascinating event, deserving of further study. However, to those aware of what beings lurk in the feywild, it is something to be feared. The eye of a namorrodor scours the land in search of prey. Almost panther-like in its behaviour, this gaunt, sleek predator searches for unfortunate souls. Using its ability to sense the waning life energy of those on death's door, the namorrodor hopes for an easy kill.",
					"Meteor Spirits.",
					"A namorrodor spends much of its time resting in the feywild. There it remains, until the sun sets on the world of mortals. When the hour grows dark, the namorrodor emerges from its home to hunt. These creatures are often referred to as meteor spirits due to the fact that as they stalk the night sky their glowing yellow eyes are often mistaken for the light of distant stars or other bright objects seen in the heavens above.",
					"Cautious Killers.",
					"These fey have four eyes, one set that glows a sickly yellow, and another that emanates a pale white light. This pair of white eyes allows them to detect and examine the life energy of mortal beings. They use these eyes to hunt prey that are easily taken down, and as a way of avoiding groups of strong enemies. Often their targets are quite elderly or very young. For this reason communities that exist nearby active openings to the feywild know to safeguard their young and elderly during nightfall. The other favourite hunting ground of the namorrodor is the battlefield after some kind of great conflict. Often soldiers and mercenaries are not well versed in the legends of the meteor spirits, making their wounded a prime target for such creatures.  ",
					"Lone Hunters.",
					"Namorrodor hunt by themselves almost exclusively. It is exceedingly rare to see more than one of these creatures hunting at the same time. The only exception to this rule is when a pair of namorrodor have formed a mating bond and are seeking to build a new nest to raise their young before going their separate ways. In such instances, the pair will work together to gather as much food as possible, and will act with aggression unusual even for their kind."

					"It was the most peculiar thing. The sun was high in the summer sky, the weather temperate and mild. Yet the farmers across the town fervently began to usher their animals inside. The braying of beasts could be heard in all directions, as not a farmhand stood idle, working towards a combined effort the likes of which I've never seen. Surely this town was far and away from my homeland, but I wouldn't imagine the way food is grown and animals tended to be much different here than anywhere else. I was wrong. I was finally able to grab the attention of a young man who had just finished ushering his cattle into shelter, he nearly jumped out of his skin when I grabbed his shoulder. \"What in the hells!\" he exclaimed, before realizing there was no danger. I asked him what all the fuss was about, and he simply replied \"It's coming\". What was I supposed to make of that? I looked all around, confused, seemingly the only sane individual for miles on end. Then suddenly, it was quiet. Everyone had gone inside. Not a soul in the streets to be seen. I made haste towards the inn, my home away from home these past few days. Perhaps someone there would be of assistance in clearing up my ignorance to whatever the issue at hand was. I walked up the creaky wooden steps, a faint breeze blowing through the bushes. Locked. I knocked for what seemed like a good few minutes before I got any response. The wind began to pick up. \"Mister, you better find somewhere to hide\" a small voice came from the other side of the door. This simply added to my confusion, but I was starting to get concerned. My horse, who was tied up near the watering trough began to cause a stir. The wind was becoming worrisome. How in the nine hells had these people known a storm was brewing on such a clear day. The polite knocking turned to pounding. Something was wrong. I could practically cut through this feeling with a dagger. A voice deep inside of me screamed it was no longer safe. I started to panic. What was happening? The wind was now howling, yet the clouds showed no sign of tempest. At this very moment I heard the door unlatch, and a small boy was standing there, a disgruntled looking father over his shoulder. \"Come in if yer comin' in\" bellowed the man as the boy grabbed my arm and guided me towards shelter. Just as I passed over that threshold, I saw, for the briefest moment, something I'm not fully sure I can describe. The sun was blotted out of the sky. At mid day, it became night. A shadow cast over the entire town. The wind became so violent, trees struggled to keep themselves within the dirt. Then there was that sound. A low, gut wrenching tone vibrated the very structure I stood upon. As the innkeep secured the door behind us, I rushed to the window. Pressed against the floor, revealing as little of myself as possible, I peered through the wooden reinforcements that covered most of the window. What I saw, was my horse. He was sailing through the air, grasped in the clutches of a monster the likes of which I have never conceived. The look on my face must have betrayed my state, as the boy sidled over to me, answering the question that would not escape my lips. In a soft tone, he simply said, \"Diablotra\".",

					"In the far reaches to the North, where the Sea of Stars meets its end, dark waves lap upon the shores of gold. Few have been to such a place, and fewer still would speak its name. The island of ten thousand crowns, or so they say. Riches beyond your wildest dreams, there for the taking. Yet this place finds itself inked on no map. Charted by no captain. Sung of by no bards in the tavern firelight. The golden shores of Rathma are not something people will so readily discuss. Those who have actually seen the twisted land find themselves mute upon its mention. They speak only cryptic warnings of things so absurd, you'd have to be a madman to conceive them. A civilization long thought dead. The King of Ash, presiding over a tribal society. Gnarled pools of twisting organisms. Monsters that would drain a man dry of blood within seconds. Then, there's the most outlandish of them all. The living tsunami. The monstrosity so large it could snap a ship in two with a single claw as though it were a mere splinter. The protector goddess of the golden shores. Praesigira. As if something so outlandish could actually exist. Surely the only reason this island paradise has not been conquered is because it simply doesn't exist. Or, does it? Remember when I said this exotic locale has found no purchase inked on parchment? I lied. For there was one man, one absolutely broken man, who came back from the edge of the world. He hasn't said a word since he washed up on shore. He simply trembles, eyes bulging, frantically looking in all directions. Clutched In his hand as his wretched form met the docks? A finely crafted scrap of lambskin. Written on its surface, the forbidden location of a place that doesn't exist. For a mere fifty gold pieces, it can be yours.",

					"Among the most sadistic creatures to walk the realms, the cruelty of purple dragons seems to be without limit. Their desire to spread fear far and wide is only matched by an unchecked avarice and self importance to rival any of the other true dragons.",
					"They are notorious for their extremely wide jaws and elongated segmented spikes which run down from the base of their skull to the tip of their tail. At birth, a purple dragon's scales are indigo. As the dragon matures, the scales become larger, thicker, harder, and darker. Adult dragons are completely violet and will continue to transition into the darkest shades of purple the longer they live.",
					"Nocturnal Hunters. Purple dragons mostly feed on livestock, large wild animals, and any humanoid creatures foolish enough to settle near them. This behavior is fairly standard for a powerful creature like a dragon, however, an added element which makes purple dragons especially fearsome is their penchant for hunting at night. Using the color of their scales to their advantage, purple dragons are extremely difficult to see as they loom in the clouds above, preparing to strike at their prey down below.",
					"Not so Deep Afterall. Many sages make the mistake of conflating purple dragons with deep dragons on account of the fact that their scales bear a similar appearance. This is only made more confusing due to the similar nesting habits of the two species. Purple dragons and deep dragons both burrow into the ground and make their homes in complex cave systems, however, deep dragons will typically burrow well into the Underdark, while purple dragons are still considered surface dwelling creatures. It is possible that the first deep dragons were indeed purple dragons that simply acclimated to life in the underdark, but both species are so rare that there can't be any consensus on their possible relation.",
					"Cunning Linguists. Although it is not known exactly how or why, it seems that all purple dragons are gifted with the unique ability to understand and be understood by any creature capable of speaking words aloud. This ancestral knowledge of all spoken language is passed down from parent to child biologically, meaning that every purple dragon is born with the ability to speak with anyone moments after hatching from their egg. Purple dragons readily make use of this ability, typically amassing large followings of loyal minions that will do their bidding for the promise of power and other tangible rewards. It is said that anywhere a purple dragon is spotted, there is certainly a network of criminals, spies, thieves, and other creatures with ill-intentions working on the dragon's behalf.  Many purple dragons consider their servants to be a fine collection and often have obvious favorites among them.",
					"Family First. While not necessarily always the case, unlike most other dragons it is very common for purple dragon families to stay together. Couplings of purple dragons will usually have few children for this reason, and any children they do have will typically only leave the nest if there is some kind of disagreement between them and their family. This knack for remaining together makes purple dragons especially dangerous and is why hunting young purple dragons is almost universally seen as an idiotic exercise, for even if you succeed, the hunter's town may yet pay the price for their actions.",
					"Purple dragons make their homes deep in the rock of mountainous areas and foothills. Their lairs are complex networks of overlapping tunnels which can run for miles depending on the size, age, and number of dragons present, but the most important thing is that their lair remains dark in order to maximize the effects of their blinding breath weapon. Should the dragon encounter stone too hard to dig through while creating its lair, the dragon's breath weapon can melt solid rock at a rapid rate, allowing them to forge ahead. These subterranean lairs often have numerous openings which allow the dragon to move around freely undetected by most within the bowels of the stone and dirt. Each entrance to the purple dragon's lair is meticulously hidden, and will usually open up near a prairie or field with ample prey.",
					"\"The dragon hunters had returned from the darkness with their prize in tow, a purple wyrmling, plucked from the highlands and cut down with impunity. When they arrived at the town gate, however, they found that the locals had sealed the entrance and barred the doors. The small settlement which was to be a stop on their journey home was silent. These people knew something that the good hunters were about to be made aware of; purple dragons stick together.\""

Some say concordant killers were an experiment by gods of neutrality, who sought to create the perfect stewards for maintaining the cosmic balance. Others hold that they were created by a long-forgotten demigod to serve as bodyguards. It is theorised that, whatever their original purpose, they failed in that endeavour, and their master was lost to a cosmic rival. Left without direction, they settled into the role of mercenaries. Whatever the truth, as beings of neutrality, concordant killers are concerned with the balance of all forces in the planes. They understand that defeating a powerful foe might tip the scales one way or another. Therefore they track their kills as a group, endeavouring to distribute their prey evenly among the the forces of the multiverse. . They keep the location of such meetings secret, though many sages believe they congregate near the central spire of the Outlands. Even deities' magic is impeded there, making it a perfect spot for clandestine gatherings.",

Anyone who destroys a concordant killer inevitably becomes the target of its irate and vengeful kin. They exist in their current state to hunt down and destroy other powerful creatures. Effective yet discreet, they are highly sought after by powerful entities such as demon lords, demigods, and even deities to do their dirty work. A concordant killer is dismissive of any prospective employer, though, unless offered substantial payment.  Concordant killers trade their services for favours, having little need for material possessions. Sometimes they request these favours at the time of hiring, but usually a contract for future payment suffices. Even gods are indebted to the concordant killers and so might look the other way, leave a planar portal open, provide information on a target's whereabouts, or undertake other favours that help the killers achieve their objectives. In the case of a recent death among their ranks, the favour may include the resurrection of a fallen comrade.",

Although they cannot consume the magical energy stored in magic items, the auras of such items still attract mageripper swarms, much as a candle flame attracts moths. The confused and hungry creatures mill about the item until  they are destroyed or find something else to eat. Consuming magical energy allows the creatures to reproduce, increasing the swarm's size. Individual swarm members live only for a year or so, but when the swarm devours magic, its constituent creatures can double their numbers within days.

Magerippers are sentient, although their intelligence is no more the cunning of a predator. They are capable of adapting their tactics to fit new circumstances. Though driven largely by the instinct to feed and reproduce, mageripper swarms can modify their behaviour in response to stimuli."

They are most often found leading legions of demons in battle. As creatures of brute force and gory battle, they seek out combat with sadistic glee, spreading fear even among other demons. They are extraordinarily egocentric and see themselves as the superior type of lifeform within the abyss. They often surround themselves with subservient minions and those who will heap flattery upon them, which they greatly enjoy (though would never admit it).",
					"Born of Blood. Deathdrinkers reproduce by dripping some of their blood into specially prepared pits of vile essence. The blood mingles with the muck, then clots and grows. Lesser demons tend to a breeding pit, regularly stirring its contents and adding fresh corpses and blood. Eventually a fully formed deathdrinker emerges.",
					"Death Obsessed. To a death drinker, the concept of taking life from others is an obsession, one which they seek to fulfil in any way possible. While taking life in combat is their favoured method of killing, whatever allows them to consume the highest amount of life is preferable. They are constantly seeking to  collect souls from those hapless enough to cross their path. Their lairs are often great castles or fortresses crafted using bones of their fallen enemies as bricks. They typically adorn these places with symbols of death and carnage, and will even horde massive bone piles to lounge upon.",

Her history as an angel, fallen to the Nine Hells and transformed into a demon in order to fight against the forces of the Abyss serves as a perfect example of the ends justifying the means in the eyes of many sun giants. These individuals will often extort weaker creatures by demanding blood sacrifice in the name of Zariel in exchange for protection.",

Sun giants, however, are blessed with eternally youthful appearances, a blessing that remains even for those who become selfish and corrupt. They tower over 25 feet tall and weigh upwards of 18,000 pounds."

					"A Gray Dragon's Lair",
					"Gray dragons are seldom found in their lair as they are often far away from home stalking prey or seeking out their next avaricious goal. They do, however, maintain a location as their home, even if they aren't there very often. They typically claim secluded locations in badlands, scrublands, dry prairies, or other areas with few visual obstructions. A gray dragon likes to see potential quarry for miles around as they fly high through the air like massive birds of prey. So keen is the eyesight of a gray dragon that it can spot the tiniest movement across a plain from miles away. Once it spots a target, it is liable to dance from cloud to cloud for hours, seeking to bridge the gap between it and its target before swooping in. Gray dragons are also one of the only draconic species that form temporary lairs. While on an extended hunt, far away from its permanent home, a gray dragon is likely to set up a base of operations it can rest in while not actively hunting its prey. Since a gray dragon's permanent lair might stand abandoned for weeks or months at a time, before leaving to go on a hunt, the dragon makes sure to seal the entrance to its home with large rocks or other such obstructions to keep nosy creatures far away."

To them, the hunt is just as, if not more important, than the meal itself. They actively seek out powerful and elusive creatures so that they might hunt and kill them.

A gray dragon likes to see potential quarry for miles around as they fly high through the air like massive birds of prey. So keen is the eyesight of a gray dragon that it can spot the tiniest movement across a plain from miles away.

Gray dragons are also one of the only draconic species that form temporary lairs.

They grew to be ten feet tall, their eyes bulged into insect-like compound nerves, they grew scythe-like blades of bone and their skin hardened and became chitinous. All of these features made them perfect killing machines, however, once their duty was done, the very people they had sought to protect discarded them. When peace had finally come to the Astral Elf people, they banished the bionoids to live out their days somewhere far away from Elf society.",
					"Resolute Warriors. Despite their treatment at the hands of their former kin, bionoids have not allowed themselves to give in to despair and hatred. They live relatively peaceful lives in small colonies that dot the multiverse. They have no unified home of which to speak, so instead they make themselves at home in all manner of places. While their appearance might be jarring at first, most communities eventually welcome neighbouring bionoid settlements as they are often both peaceful allies and capable defenders if trouble should appear. While bionoids largely don't wish for warfare, they do still maintain a warrior culture. They train in combat both as a way to protect themselves, and achieve tranquillity over both body and mind. As beings engineered for warfare, they find this helps them control the power they have been granted.",
					"Weird Eggs. Bionoids reproduce in a highly peculiar way. Fully mature bionoid eggs are disc-shaped objects roughly six inches in diameter. They're rigid, dark green in colour, and covered in a thin layer of mucus. In the centre of each egg is the crystalline gem that will eventually find itself in the forehead of the fully grown bionoid. When another living creature touches the egg, it reacts and latches itself onto them, forming a shell around the creature's body. This shell is the bionoid. Once the bionoid has reached the first stage of maturity, usually after about six months, the creature separates itself from the host and begins life as an independent creature. During the time the egg is attached to the host, the bionoid has full control of the creature, though it may choose to relinquish control if it wants. While attached to the host, the two creatures also share a telepathic link and are able to communicate with one another at any time. If the host dies before the bionoid separates itself, the bionoid will revert back to its egg form. This process is typically harmless for the host being, if not unpleasant."

A genius loc, or \"spirit of the land\", is such a place. They are incredibly difficult to spot, since they look like any other section of a landscape. One can appear as a mountain, an isolated valle, a small lake, a deep cavern, a single field, a tiny moon, or an entire plane of existence.

The genius loci will actively seek out a sentient creature that it can form a telepathic bond with in order to use that creature as both its mouthpiece and guardian. Once it has enthralled a creature, the genius loci may be in total control of the creature's actions, but the creature's personality also tends to fill in many of the gaps in the genius loci's sentience. A genius loci with a particularly cruel and violent thrall is likely to be much more aggressive and quick to battle. Conversely, a genius loci with a more calm and even tempered thrall is going to be much more passive unless threatened. Whatever the situation, anyone enthralled by a genius loci inhabits the landscape of the creature in whatever manner is available to it. Some thralls live in structures which are actually part of the genius loci, while others may nest in trees or burrows. Each genius loci has only one thrall at a time, however, other creatures may also inhabit its surface."

When the possession ends without the killer being brought to justice, the corpse candle returns to its original body and waits for another creature to possess. If the dead body belonging to the corpse candle is buried, cremated, or otherwise put to rest without the killer being brought to justice, the slain creature will rise as a {@creature revenant} (Monster Manual pg. 259) in {@dice 1d4} days."

As a result, no mortal creature from the Material Plane can lay a finger on them with the intent of causing harm. If a particularly strong willed creature manages to overcome the magic at play to actually attack a harvester devil, there is also an immediate backlash that weakens the creature as punishment for breaking with cosmic law. Because of this, harvester devils act with a pompous confidence that nothing can harm them. Since few creatures can muster the mental fortitude to attack these fiends openly, when a harvester devil is causing problems many seek to either banish or imprison the fiend instead, but this is no easy task either.",

Its bearing is regal, and the creature stands upright, analysing you with four curious eyes. In one of its hands it clutches a golden staff, and its body is adorned with all manner of arcane trinkets and finery.",
					"Two Headed Corvus. Chronotyryns are large semi-humanoid monstrosities that resemble crows. In much the same way that crows are considered highly intelligent when compared to other common birds, the chronotyryn is a genius among monsters. They are intelligent in the extreme, large in part due to the fact that they have two brains. Unlike other two-headed creatures, such as ettins, the chronotyryn has one singular personality. While they are capable of taking multiple actions simultaneously, the chronotyryn is still one individual personality. It doesn't argue with itself and the two heads never disagree on anything, because they are the same entity. Sometimes the creature will converse with itself creating the illusion that the heads are having a back and forth conversation. This, however, is merely the way a chronotyryn works through its thoughts. When speaking directly to someone else the two heads speak simultaneously, providing an eerie echo for itself.",
					"Imperious Magicians. Chronotyryns are exceptionally talented in the ways of magic and equally condescending. They use their intelligence to master spells that are out of reach for most creatures. This allows them to achieve great things in a short amount of time, and to ensure they are prepared for any situation in battle. By dividing their intellect between two brains, the chronotyryn can cast spells and take other actions in quick succession, sometimes even simultaneously casting two different spells at once. They thirst for knowledge relentlessly and are known to hoard all manner of arcane secrets, only willing to trade them in exchange for something of equal value.",
					"Adamantine Feathers. The feathers of a chronotyryn are nearly impenetrable. They naturally grow a coat of adamantine-infused feathers that makes for both an excellent shield, and a deadly natural weapon. Their feathers are often sought after by blacksmiths as a source of adamantine that does not need to be extracted from a mine. Many chronotyryns are willing to trade their old feathers in exchange for magical items they can make use of.",
					"Trinket Collectors. Much like the crows they bear a passing similarity with, chronotyryns love to collect shiny objects. Rather than gathering trinkets based solely on how they glitter in the light, chronotyryns collect magic items. They are always adorned in gold and silver finery that often serves a purpose beyond looking nice. Many of the objects worn by these creatures are enchanted to provide some kind of benefit to the chronotyryn. They also make a point to carry an arcane staff with them wherever they go to augment their spells and in some cases allow them access to spells they don't normally have prepared."

					"Humanoid creatures covered in fur with canine heads, the lupin dominate the steppes and forests where their nomadic packs roam. Their culture is built around honour, loyalty, and friendship, but woe be to those who cross them with deception or steel.",
					"Contested Histories. The origin of the lupin race is a topic that not even the lupin themselves can be certain of. The oldest tales of lupin packs speak of a time where the lupin and werewolf races were one and the same, however, the lupin descend from lycanthropes who cast off the chaos of their monthly murderous sprees in order to become somethign more. A sophisticated race, fully in control of both body and mind. Other lupin scholars have more recently proposed a radical theory based on what little written history of the lupin people exists. This new theory suggests that the lupin race came from a union of humans and gnolls, and that early lupins became famed werewolf hunters in order to prove to their fearful human neighbours that they indeed were not werewolves. The objective truth may never be truly known as the vast majority of lupin culture is passed down orally, and therefore the question lingers still.",
					"Werewolf Hunters. Lupins are experts in the field of hunting lycanthropes, specifically, werewolves. The act of hunting and killing werewolves has always been of great significance and bears a nearly spiritual significance amongst the lupin packs. Once a child reaches maturity, they are immediately taken into the fold of lupin hunters and taught the ways of hunting werewolves following an initiation rite known as the Moonset. Werewolves are seen as a mockery of lupin kind. The death and destruction they spread reflects poorly on lupin communities, as many other races often mistake lupins for werewolves from a distance. The murderous tendancies of werewolves also goes directly against the friendly and charitable outlook held by most lupin communities, and as such, werewolves are seen as abominations which must be destroyed.",
					"Nomadic Packs. Lupins typically live in communities consisting of three to fifteen packs consisting of two to twelve individuals (and several pups). These communities practice strict egalitarian democracy and usually operate without an individual leader, though elders in the community can often sway the votes of younger members. Once per year, the overall community selects a representative from among the packs' elders as a spokesperson. This post is only ever held for one year and cannot be selected again until an elder from every other pack in the community has acted as spokesperson.Once per year, the selected spokesperson and any of the youths within the community who wish to go travel to a gathering of other lupin representatives from nearby communities called a White Howl. This White Howl acts as both a meeting for important discussion among the elders and as a chance for young lupins to find companions from outside the community in an effort to intertwine the overall lupin people with bonds of friendship, rivalry, and love. Once the important aspects of the Whit Howl have been attended to, it often turns into a three week long celebration.",
					"The Eternal Flame. Each lupin community is liable to wander within their territory to a degree, however, they do construct villages composed of wooden longhouses typically built in a radial pattern surrounding a public space. In the centre of this space, the lupins maintain a continuous flame known as a bg'tyr. Even when the tribe moves from its village to wander for long periods of time, a single member of the community, usually an adolescent,  always remains behind to tend the flame and ensure it doesn't go out. These individuals are referred to as flame keepers, and often grow up to prominence as one of the lupin communities' spiritual leaders.",
					"Ah'flir. The week of the full moon is an important and sacred time for lupins. During the three days when the moon is brightest, accomplished lupin werewolf hunters (called hruffs) from all the packs in a region gather together and form a temporary pack of their own called an ah'flir. These ah'flir packs have the specific purpose of hunting down and killing as many lycanthropes as possible, especially werewolves."

					"Mysterious Origin. Nobody really knows the true nature of the false hydra. Scholars the world over are left guessing as to the true nature of these creatures. What is known is that by the time their presence is apparent, it is often too late. The false hydra begins its life cycle as a lump of white flesh, growing and festering deep beneath the ground of a town or city. Their genesis is brought on by an abundance of lies and half-truths told by members of a community. Often these creatures manifest in kingdoms where propaganda has become out of control.

Similar to how a water elemental might be most comfortable in an exceptionally wet location filled with lots of water, the blood elemental is at its happiest when surrounded by the blood of other creatures. This instinct to find, absorb, and be surrounded by blood often leads to horrible acts of violence against living creatures that have blood. Once a blood elemental has absorbed a significant amount of blood into its form, it will split into two separate blood elementals and work together to find more blood they can feed on.

It's for this reason that their summoning is considered taboo even among those who dabble in the dark arts."

The main body of the creature is covered in eyes, a few of which protrude from the creature on gangly stalks.",
					"Heart of the Dungeon. The deepspawn are an enigmatic race of aberrant creatures. They were first discovered in The Underdark, but nobody truly knows exactly what their origin is. Aside from being horrific creatures capable of doling out carnage on the field of battle, they are especially feared for their ability to create perfect copies of creatures they consume. The spawn created by this twisted abomination are one-to-one clones of the original creature and even the most discerning mages find it impossible to differentiate between the two beings. The only difference seems to be that the clones a deepspawn creates are fanatically loyal to their creator. They view an attack on the deepspawn as an attack on themselves and will willingly lay down their lives if it means protecting their aberrant parent. Because of this, many deepspawn populate their lairs with hordes of monsters they have consumed, which can sometimes lead to unexpected ecosystems in an area occupied by a deepspawn.",
					"Varied Armaments. Deepspawn are perfectly capable of wielding any weapon that would typically be used by a humanoid creature. They favor large weapons like greatswords and greataxes, however, they can effectively use any armaments that can be wielded by their tentacles. They also have a limited ability to use magic, which they employ to great effect.",
					"Insidious Schemers. Despite their bestial appearance, deepspawn are incredibly intelligent and patient tacticians. In combat they prefer to let their minions do the fighting. Rather than throwing themselves into harm's way, they deploy their countless spawned agents in the direction of anyone who wishes harm on them. If forced into a situation where combat is inevitable, they bury themselves in rubble or treasure deep within their lair in order to get the drop on the intruders. As intelligent beings they are also not above bargaining if defeat seems inevitable, or if they are dealing with a powerful creature who has something they want.",
					"Hidden Lairs. These massive aberrations prefer to lair in places that are far away from prying eyes. Secluded caves, ancient ruins, and other such desolate areas unlikely to draw much attention are all ideal spots for the deepspawn to live. They typically keep to their own devices, securing power and security for themselves, though sometimes they will send agents to nearby settlements of intelligent creatures to expand their influence and lure victims to the deepspawn's lair. While the creatures can subsist off of any diet, they crave the flesh of intelligent creatures. Often when they consume an intelligent creature they create a spawn of the individual and send them back to the victim's town to take their place. This allows the deepspawn to use them as a spy, and avoid suspicion at the same time.",
					"Copy of a Copy. Over time, the deepspawn's ability to create a spawn of the same creature will slowly deteriorate. Once it has consumed a living organism the first few clones of that creature will be near perfect recreations, however, the more it uses that creature's essence to create a spawn the more slight defects will emerge. Typically the spawn's cognitive abilities are the first place cracks begin to form, until eventually, the spawn is naught but a grotesque imitation of the original."

					"Animated Works of Art. Every singular ship in a bottle signifies an immense level of patience and dedication. The average craftsman might spend weeks carefully constructing the ship by moving each individual piece through the opening in the bottle until eventually, the final product is created. Many of these creations are made by sea captains who take the time to craft a replica of their own vessel. In most cases where the ship in a bottle becomes an animated construct, it is because a wayward water spirit has taken up residence in the tiny work of art. Depending on the nature of that water spirit, it may become aggressive with other creatures, believing that they are intruding on its territory by travelling the open sea, or it may become curious and choose to follow the ship's creator around.",
					"Formation of an Armada. When multiple ships in bottles are gathered together, they will instinctively pool the spiritual energy used to animate the ships themselves and for a cohesive fleet of animated objects. Once an armada is formed the individual water spirits animating each individual ship become nigh inseparable and will operate with singular purpose. In battle, the ships will fight using naval tactics in order to take down any threat they come across.",
					"Tiny Crews. Each water spirit that takes up residency in a bottled ship expresses its personality through extremely small humanoid creatures that \"crew\" the ship. These little cremates are all part of the same water spirit, however, they often appear to have their own little personalities and will interact with one another as if they were a proper ship's crew.",
					"Commissioned Curiosities. On occasion, an animated ship in a bottle might be created on purpose by a skilled craftsman who is familiar with the magic used to summon elemental creatures. Such an individual might summon a water spirit from the Elemental Plane of Water to occupy the ship in a bottle, similar to how an elemental's spirit is used to give life to a golem. When a ship in a bottle is crafted in this way, it is entirely loyal to the craftsman (or an individual denoted by the craftsman) and will view them as though they were their admiral in command. While it is possible for someone to create an entire armada of loyal ships in bottles, this is a rare occurrence due to the exorbitant cost involved with creating so many animated ships.",

					"An armada of tiny ships, each one secure in a glass bottle the size of a boot, rallies together and floats through the air as though sailing on the tide of some arcane force. Each ship is crewed by a group of tiny sailors, and the ships move as one to attack.",
					"Animated Works of Art. Every singular ship in a bottle signifies an immense level of patience and dedication. The average craftsman might spend weeks carefully constructing the ship by moving each individual piece through the opening in the bottle until eventually, the final product is created. Many of these creations are made by sea captains who take the time to craft a replica of their own vessel. In most cases where the ship in a bottle becomes an animated construct, it is because a wayward water spirit has taken up residence in the tiny work of art. Depending on the nature of that water spirit, it may become aggressive with other creatures, believing that they are intruding on its territory by travelling the open sea, or it may become curious and choose to follow the ship's creator around.",
					"Formation of an Armada. When multiple ships in bottles are gathered together, they will instinctively pool the spiritual energy used to animate the ships themselves and for a cohesive fleet of animated objects. Once an armada is formed the individual water spirits animating each individual ship become nigh inseparable and will operate with singular purpose. In battle, the ships will fight using naval tactics in order to take down any threat they come across.",
					"Tiny Crews. Each water spirit that takes up residency in a bottled ship expresses its personality through extremely small humanoid creatures that \"crew\" the ship. These little cremates are all part of the same water spirit, however, they often appear to have their own little personalities and will interact with one another as if they were a proper ship's crew.",
					"Commissioned Curiosities. On occasion an animated ship in a bottle might be created on purpose by a skilled craftsman who is familiar with the magic used to summon elemental creatures. Such an individual might summon a water spirit from the Elemental Plane of Water to occupy the ship in a bottle, similar to how an elemental's spirit is used to give life to a golem. When a ship in a bottle is crafted in this way, it is entirely loyal to the craftsman (or an individual denoted by the craftsman) and will view them as though they were their admiral in command. While it is possible for someone to create an entire armada of loyal ships in bottles, this is a rare occurrence due to the exorbitant cost involved with creating so many animated ships.",

Alternatively you can spend 5 gp on the materials and build it yourself over the course of a week of downtime by succeeding on a DC 18 Woodworking Tools (Dexterity) check.",
					"Then, over the course of one hour, you must cast the spells animate object, magic jar, and conjure elemental. If you already have the spirit of a water elemental in your possession (such as in an elemental gem) you do not need to cast conjure elemental.",
					"Once the final spell has been cast, the ship will become an animated ship in a bottle and will be fully loyal to one creature chosen by the individual casting the final spell.",

They reside in the darkest corners of the Shadowfell, only ever shifting to the Material Plane to trade with others or to enact some sort of plan. The fact that they grow tremendous in size when exposed to the light of the sun is largely responsible for them being classified as giants by many scholars who did not fully understand what they were looking at.",

It is the only substance capable of accepting their essence and acting as a sort of egg, in order to propagate the species. To ensure they have a healthy stock of obsidian on hand, shadow giant merchants will travel to the Material Plane with their collection of valuables in order to trade them with mortals for as much obsidian as they can carry. Due to their appearance and notoriety as beings from the Shadowfell, they often avoid large city centres, instead opting for more secluded areas on the outskirts of large cities. The ideal situation for a shadow giant is to arrange an understanding with someone in a position of power to keep regular trade of goods from the Shadowfell flowing in exchange for a steady supply of obsidian they can rely on.",

They reside in The Black and are doomed to a cursed existence caught between the infinite darkness of their new home and the Material Plane.

					"Steel dragons are sociable, clever, and curious. They often prefer to navigate the world shapeshifted into the form of a human to learn all they can of humanoid life and customs. The scales of a steel dragon range from a deep blue-grey at birth to a lustrous and burnished steel in adulthood. The brighter the scale's shine, the older the dragon. Their faces are extremely expressive and easily portray their emotions to creatures of other species. They have a wide wingspan with sharp, segmented wings that create the illusion of bundled blades. They also have fine steel spines that grow from their head and neck that raise and lower depending on the dragon's mood. The creature smells of wet metal and moves with feline-like grace.",
					"Curious Minds. Steel dragons are incredibly hard to detect due to their penchant for enjoying humanoid life. They have a deep love and curiosity towards all humanoid lifeforms, especially humans given their relatively adaptive nature. To   sate this curiosity they will spend the majority of their life shifted into the form of a humanoid creature, living among them, experiencing their culture, and forming true friendships with a great many people. They naturally gravitate towards those who share their curious mind, a preference that typically leads them to places of learning such as colleges, libraries, or other locales that attract scholarly types. In exchange for good conversation and a healthy dose of questioning about all manner of things, the dragon will happily share some of its more useful knowledge with unsuspecting friends.",
					"Paragons of Order. Steel dragons are generally good natured, however, they also crave order. To them, the basis of a good civilization is a proper code of laws that are just and upheld with no ambiguity. While these dragons don't typically get involved with the politics of the places they live, they will step in, maintaining their disguise if possible, to guide a city in the right direction or to help in the city's defence against some kind of outside threat. Unlike gold dragons who often seek to hunt down and punish evil doers with zealous fervour, steel dragons are more concerned with the state of their own city and are very unlikely to venture out into the wider world unless convinced there is some kind of threat to the people they are so fond of.",
					"Many Lives. While it may not be peculiar for a dragon to live for several thousand years or more, in the case of even the longest lived humanoid races, the lifespan of a dragon seems nearly infinite. Understanding this, and not wishing to have their true identity compromised, steel dragons in disguise will use their magic to gradually create an illusion that they are ageing, imitating the lifespan of whatever race they masquerade as. Eventually, they may even fake their own death or use some kind of excuse to explain why they are leaving town, never to return, only for the dragon to take on a new persona and arrive back in the same town they love to start all over again. They often transition between identities of various different races and walks of life, however, they always have a telltale sign that indicates their true heritage such as a streak of steel-grey hair, metallic fingernails, or even a steel accessory such as a ring or bangle. To a steel dragon, each new persona is a chance to better understand the people the dragon shares a world with.",
					"Peaceful Titans. Due to the massive amount of power that a steel dragon holds, they almost never resort to violence. Not only would they easily destroy most creatures who threaten them without knowing what they truly are, but the resulting chaos could only serve to harm other people in the area. When pushed into a corner and given no choice, however, a steel dragon will fight tooth and nail to defend its domain and loved ones. They often prefer to use their poisonous gas to knock enemies unconscious rather than simply destroying them.",
					"Unlearned Scholars. Due to the steel dragon's propensity to spend such long periods of time in humanoid form, some scholars and sages have tried to argue that they don't even exist, and instead, that the steel dragon is merely a misidentified silver dragon or perhaps some other kind of metallic creature with draconic ancestry. While these claims are understandable, and in some cases may be true, they only serve to display the care and discretion taken by steel dragons to protect their true identities.",
					"Steel dragons are all too real, and as far as they're concerned the longer they can convince the misinformed scholars of the world they're not, the better."

It's unclear if they originated as a known humanoid species, or if they began life as some other kind of creature, but regardless of their organic origins they have long since moved past the shape nature intended for them to have. By using their knowledge of technology and science, they have taken evolution into their own hands. While they do have semi organic bodies, much of their form is fashioned from metal and other unnatural worked materials. These augmentations give them great strength and keen minds, however, they also make them vulnerable to magic that normally only affects inanimate objects or constructs.",
					"Unnatural Lifecycle. The oard has  a truly strange lifecycle when compared to most other humanoid species. They are not born, but rather grown in tanks specifically fashioned for the development of their young. Once a child has finished its growing phase within the tank, it is gradually \"upgraded\" with all manner of technological improvements until the creature is nearly indistinguishable from the rest of its kind. The longevity of the oard is largely unknown, but sages theorise that they may have no upper age limit given their extremely competent skills with augmentation and technology. It is possible that the final stage of oard life is one where every trace of organic matter has been replaced with machinery and metal.",
					"Time Travelers. The singular mission of oard society seems to be the total domination and assertion of their authority over all creation itself. They attempt to achieve this goal by travelling through time in order to change historical events in subtle ways that will better suit the schemes of the oard in the long run. They are able to do this by utilising their time travel mirrors, devices that allow a creature to step over a threshold and into the past. This trip is a one way ordeal, however, so any creature that uses such a device is unable to return to the present. As a result, members of oard civilization can be found across all periods of history."

They are not particularly good at organising their lairs, so even finding a specific object in the disorganised heap can be an adventure in and of itself.

					"Living Bridges. Spanners are living, intelligent, stone bridges. Nobody knows where these creatures first originated, but most scholars believe they began as mimics who were altered by arcane magic and twisted into the form of a bridge. They likely served as guardians and sentries for their creator's lair. Since then though, spanners have migrated through the countryside and spread far and wide the world over. They are known to come in all shapes and sizes, sometimes as a relatively small stone bridge across a brook, other times as a massive stone connector bridging impossibly long gaps. Nobody knows how, or if, they reproduce, but the assumption is that once a single individual reaches a massive size, they split into two separate entities and go their own way. ",
					"Gossiping Infrastructure. These creatures are of average intelligence and fully capable of communicating with spoken word. They have a low, gravelly voice that rumbles the rest of the creature's body while they speak. Spanners love to listen in on what those walking across their back have to say. They are particularly fond of good gossip and stories about far off lands. While most spanners are content to lay idle for years at a time, some specimens are more outspoken and actively prevent creatures from walking over them unless they can provide the spanner with an interesting tale or bit of information. ",
					"Protective by Nature. Spanners have no natural end to their lifespan, and as such, will sometimes stay in one place for hundreds of years if the locale is to their liking. Those that are of more social inclination often form relationships with people who cross them regularly. A spanner that provides transport over a river in and out of a small town is liable to know all the merchants, hunters, guardsmen, or anyone else that comes and goes from town frequently. Even if the creature chooses to keep its true nature hidden, it likely knows a lot about the people in town due to its interest in listening to others as they walk across it. This can make them a valuable source of information. Spanners also take great lengths to protect those it cares about from harm. Bandits seeking to cross the spanner in order to raid a village on the other side might find the bridge actively fighting back or simply moving to prevent their crossing. They also seem to have a soft spot for wildlife, freely allowing animals to cross their bodies, and punishing poachers or other individuals it sees as abusive to the natural world. "

When not in the immediate presence of their master, wheeps are commonly sent on missions to act as emissaries and messengers, destined to deliver fell omens and warning on behalf of their lord. Wheeps are also occasionally sent on missions to infiltrate well-protected cemeteries in order to procure the remains of particularly powerful and heroic individuals that might be twisted into service by their unliving lord.",

In life, wheeps were individuals who have been completely overtaken with sorrow. Often after the destruction of a city at the hands of an undead army, the necromancer in command will seek out what few survivors remain and select the most despondent among them to \"ascend\". Once a wheep is created it knows only sadness and cruelty. ",

Unlike many other creatures, dragons only seem to get more powerful as they age, so as the hag dragon increases its age it becomes incredibly dangerous in a short amount of time.

Due to their canine appearance and penchant for activity at night, the moon dog is often mistaken for a more baleful creature such as a ferocious wolf or yeth hound, but that couldn't be further from the truth. Moon dogs are native to the celestial plane and almost always act in the interest of protecting innocent creatures. They use their magical abilities to act on behalf of good aligned deities that hold authority over domains of light, travel, and protection. ",
					"Relentless Pursuit. Moon dogs can be extremely potent fighters and they apply their skill in combat to further their relentless pursuit of evil. When in small numbers, they use their ability to communicate with other canines to form large packs that incorporate wolves, dire wolves, and other canine creatures that can be reasoned with. A moon dog heading up a pack of mundane canine creatures is bound to be a boon to any travellers in the region, as the pack will hunt down any and all evildoers they can get their paws on. "

They make their homes on tropical islands, on the seafloor, and in large reefs teeming with sea life. Though they tend to live in obscurity, they do not live in squalor. Reef giants construct and live within colossal mansions large enough to house them comfortably in luxury. They make sure to take time for relaxation and enjoyment of life as a point, making sure to avoid being involved with politics and other such petty endeavours. As such, they are completely exempt from the ordning, opting not to participate in giant culture beyond their own. ",
					"Monogamous Lovers. While unjoined, reef giants may live a lonely life, should they find a partner and fall in love, they mate for life. When two reef giants find one another to be suitable companions, they merge what riches and other assets they have and live their life of luxury together. Should the pair ever produce children, upon reaching adulthood, all but the eldest daughter leave the giant's estate to claim their own corner of the ocean. Traditionally, the eldest daughter remains with her parents to care for them as they pass into old age, and eventually to the afterlife, however, such service doesn't come without reward. Upon the passing of her final parent, all riches and estate owned by her parents pass on to the ownership and care of the eldest daughter to do with as she pleases. Such an eligible bachelorette often attracts suitors from the surrounding area, who are welcomed to make their case for partnership. Reef giants are notoriously picky, unwilling to settle for anything less than exactly what they want, and this attitude also extends to their choice of companion. In many cases the eldest daughter may simply exchange her assets for treasure and take up a life of adventure before finding a place to call her own. ",
					"Strange Wanderers. Many reef giants are content to simply live out their long lives in a paradise of their own creation, however, there are always those among them that wish to see more of the world before settling down. Such individuals often find work as sailors, though only the largest seafaring vessels can manage to take them aboard. Those that choose a simple life are often able to grind out a living by taking various treasures and oddities from the seafloor to market for trade, using the gold they earn to pay for materials and other luxuries they can't find themselves in the ocean."

					"This small egg-shaped creature wanders around aimlessly. Its two suction cupped feet make a tremendous amount of noise as it moves. The creature's body is a greenish-blue that darkens into a deep purple around the bottom of its bulbous form. Atop its head is a nest of tentacles that reach out and attempt to feel anything nearby, while its two massive eyes stare vacantly ahead. On either side of the monster is a spindly arm which it seems to flap up and down uncontrollably, as if trying to fly. ",
					"Walking Eggs. Known among sages as the alkada, and to everyone else as the wingless wonder, these mysterious creatures baffle even the most learned scholars. They are extremely simple minded and seem utterly inept at defending themselves in the wild. This has made encountering a wingless wonder a rare event, due to the fact that very few of them survive anywhere other creatures are plentiful. Their poisonous flesh does keep most predators at bay, however, this does not stop many of the humanoid creatures they encounter from attacking them on sight, presuming that they pose some kind of threat. Though in some places, they are known to be harmless by the population and are simply left to their devices.",
					"Fearless Explorers. Fear is not an instinct that exists within the wingless wonder. Neither is common sense. Wonders explore the world around them with a shy fascination that leads them down just about any path they find themselves on. They are utterly fascinated by shiny objects such as gemstones and reflective surfaces, and will happily place such things in their mouth, located at the centre of their massed tentacles. Though these objects provide no sustenance to the creature, they enjoy collecting them nonetheless. ",
					"Egg Baskets. The wingless wonder carries around anywhere between one and a dozen alkada eggs at any given time. When meeting another of its kind, the two may fertilise the eggs carried by one another. An alkada carries a fertilised egg for six months before placing it on the ground, whereupon it hatches instantly. The young alkada follow their parent for a time, but mature rapidly before going their own way. ",
					"Trapped Wizards. Approximately a quarter of all wingless wonders wandering the land are actually transformed humanoid creatures, many of which were wizards or spellcasters of some kind. They are the result of a trend among wizards where rather than simply killing your enemy at the end of an arcane duel, the winner would trap the defeated in wonder form using a spell called {@spell Thaelur's Wonder|dungeondadstatblocks}. This was widely seen as a fate worse than death and may also be the true origin of the alkada species. Being trapped as a wingless wonder is a maddening experience, only elongated by the fact that alkada don't seem to have an upper limit on their natural lives, only dying when slain by another creature or their own stupidity."

						"A 10-foot-radius sphere of antimagic surrounds the wonder. Within the sphere, spells can't be cast, summoned creatures disappear, and magic items become mundane. Spells and other magical effects, except those created by an artifact or a deity or a casting of dispel magic or remove curse, are suppressed in the sphere and can't protrude into it. A slot expended to cast a suppressed spell is consumed. While an effect is suppressed, it doesn't function, but the time it spends suppressed counts against its duration. Spells and other magical effects, such as magic missile and charm person, that target a creature or an object in the sphere have no effect on that target. The area of another spell or magical effect, such as fireball, can't extend into the sphere. If the sphere overlaps an area of magic, the part of the area that is covered by the sphere is suppressed. For example, the flames created by a wall of fire are suppressed within the sphere, creating a gap in the wall if the overlap is large enough. Any active spell or other magical effect on a creature or an object in the sphere is suppressed while the creature or object is in it. The properties and powers of magic items are suppressed in the sphere. For example, a +1 longsword in the sphere functions as a nonmagical longsword. A magic weapon's properties and powers are suppressed if it is used against a target in the sphere or wielded by an attacker in the sphere. If a magic weapon or a piece of magic ammunition fully leaves the sphere (for example, if you fire a magic arrow or throw a magic spear at a target outside the sphere), the magic of the item ceases to be suppressed as soon as it exits.  Teleportation and planar travel fail to work in the sphere, whether the sphere is the destination or the departure point for such magical travel. A portal to another location, world, or plane of existence, as well as an opening to an extradimensional space such as that created by the rope trick spell, temporarily closes while in the sphere. A creature or object summoned or created by magic temporarily winks out of existence in the sphere. Such a creature instantly reappears once the space the creature occupied is no longer within the sphere. Spells and magical effects such as dispel magic have no effect on the sphere. Likewise, the spheres created by different antimagic field spells don't nullify each other."

Gigants who have been in service for many years are usually adorned in many petrified arms, legs, and heads, all taken to be worn as pieces of jewellery. "

					"This bloated mass of flesh and bone merely suggests the general shape of a being who was once humanoid.

					"Almost Humanoid. An orangeseer is a creature that was once a humanoid being, but by excessive use of orangespice has transformed into something new. While daily users of orangespice may gain precognitive abilities, they are nothing compared to the raw psionic energy housed within an orangeseer who has completely surrendered themselves to the spice's allure. It has granted the orangeseers future sight and vision into alternate timelines beyond even the most gifted practitioners of divination magic, however, these fantastic abilities are not without costt. Orangeseers are entirely dependent on orangespice, and without it, they will gradually wither and die. ",
					"Life of Luxury. Many orangeseers live in utter extravagance. They know how valuable their abilities of future sight can be, and are happy to loan these services out to anyone who can afford their exorbitant fees. Only the wealthiest organisations or individuals can afford to keep an orangeseer on payroll for long periods of time, but those that can pay the cost in gold often reap the benefits afforded only to those with knowledge of events yet to transpire.

					"Orangespice is a fine orange powder that carries the unmistakable scent of cinnamon. It is a byproduct of microscopic organisms who occupy desert regions across the multiverse. Regular consumption of this highly addictive substance can grant the user precognitive abilities and extend their lifespan well beyond what is natural for their species, however, these boons don't come without danger. The substance alters the creature's genetic makeup, and once a creature has accustomed themselves to orangespice they become reliant on it. A single dose of orangespice consists of an amount roughly the same size as a sugar cube. It is not possible to reduce your dependency on orangespice, only to maintain your usage, increase your usage, or stop altogether. The effects are cumulative, meaning that if you increase frequency of use you gain all the benefits (and drawbacks) of less frequent usage. Use the following table to determine how orangespice effects a creature ingesting it, and what will happen to them if they stop. ",

					"Grudging Respect. Pie fiends are one of the strangest creatures to ever emerge from the hells, so strange in fact that some scholars believe them to be mere myth, nothing more than a joke exchanged between the learned. In reality, they are all too real, and it would behoove those who value their souls to take them seriously. Even other devils understand the power held by an accomplished pie fiend, and while they may make jokes about them in private, they are compelled to show these devils respect, lest they face the wrath of their superior.",
					"Bakery of Souls. Like all devils who operate within The Nine Hells, pie fiends trade and barter in souls. They are highly intelligent, and master manipulators. Using their ability to take on the form of humanoid creatures to influence mortals seems to be their primary method of harvesting souls, afterall, one is much more likely to let their guard down around the kindly old woman who bakes delicious pies than they are around a bonafide devil from beyond the Material Plane. They often set up bakeries in small towns and then use their standing with the townsfolk to sway events one way or another in their favor. Occasionally they will even establish themselves in large cities, working in conjunction with other devils to bring the populace to its knees through the art of baking cursed confections. It is said that pie fiends are capable of baking sweets so incredible that a mortal might be tempted to trade their soul simply to have a second bite, and even if they don't get a soul out of the deal, it can at least provide the pie fiend with an unparalleled distraction. ",
					"Sweet Tooth. Unsurprisingly, pie fiends have a sweet tooth that would make even the most decadent noble blush. They love sweets, especially baked goods, and often go out of their way to acquire such things whenever the opportunity arises. They are exceptionally fond of baked treats that are made with unfamiliar methods, such as those from cultures not encountered by the fiend or a particular baker's specialty. They not only savor the flavor of these confections, but they also make sure to either find or figure out the recipe of any delectable dessert they come across in their recipe book. Every pie fiend's prize possession is their infernal tome of desert recipes. Each one contains all the desserts, both magical and mundane, that particular pie fiend knows how to make. The possibility of adding to this recipe book is often a driving force in any given pie fiend's actions. "

While she cuts the silhouette of a beautiful humanoid creature, it's impossible to see any surface area of her physical body due to the shroud of pure white cloth that flows to-and-fro as if caught in an omnidirectional breeze. As the woman hovers into the air, she speaks with a voice, quiet as a whisper, but with the authority to move mountains. ",
					"Mother of Demons. Pale Night very well might be the oldest creature currently living within The Abyss, and possibly even the multiverse itself. There is much conflicting information about this enigmatic demoness, though one thing is certain, she is feared by all, even other demons. Pale Night is an Obyrith, a species of demon that is all but extinct. During their time in power, an age long before the first mortal drew breath, the Obryiths were the uncontested masters of The Abyss. As their ambition grew, eventually, they were hunted relentlessly by the Eladrin and other celestials intent on purging their dark influence from the multiverse. Despite this, Pale Night survived. She chose to bide her time, lurking in unseen places, methodically plotting her next move. Many believe it was Pale Night that gave rise to the first among the current population of demons living within The Abyss. She is said to be the mother of Graz'zt, among several other demon lords.",
					"Veiled Madness. Pale Night's true form is something so horrific, so unbelievably wrong, that reality itself simply rejects her appearance. The veil that covers her entire body is a magical and cosmic effect put in place by the laws of the multiverse in order to prevent her from spilling out and corrupting everything around her. She is able to temporarily suppress this veil, however, it takes a tremendous amount of willpower meaning it is only possible to do so for mere moments. Some scholars believe the veil itself is some kind of divine being that came to be as a response to Pale Night's presence, however, this is still a subject of much debate. Most creatures who lay eyes upon her true form die instantly, and those who survive find it impossible to describe what they've seen. In many cases their memory simply lapses due to the fact that their brain is incapable of rationalising whatever it is that lies beyond the veil, and those who do retain even minor, inconsequential bits of information are typically rendered completely mad. ",
					"Winds of Change. The way Pale Night might react to an intruder within her realm is nearly impossible to predict. She is capricious and prone to flights of fancy that don't seem to follow any observable pattern. Sometimes she considers the mere act of a mortal speaking to her to be a sin worth of painful destruction. Other times, she seems completely aloof, and rarely, she even enjoys conversation with others, sending them on errands that typically involve the death of an enemy or rival demon in The Abyss. Whether this is just her chaotic nature as a demon lord made manifest, or the result of some unknown insight Pale Night possesses, it makes her a volatile entity to interact with. ",
					"Silent Cults. Like all demon lords, Pale Night has cultists on the Material Plane that worship her as a god. Unlike most other demon lords, she doesn't seek out or even interact with any of her cultists with almost no exception. Cults of Pale Night are typically focused on gaining access to her domain so that they might present themselves as humble servants to act in her service. Many cultists fantasise about being wrapped in her shroud and transformed into a shrouded knight in their lady's service. ",
					"Madness of Pale Night",

This often gets them in trouble, or at least causes troubles for others, as their preoccupied minds tend to notice little else around them beyond the subject of their ponderings which can result in the oblivious destruction of whatever finds itself underfoot. ",
					"Marked By The Cosmos. The body of an eclipse giant is marked by numerous tattoos that depict various celestial bodies and star charts. These tattoos can carry many different meanings. Some are a representation of the night sky during an important event in the giant's life such as a great victory in battle, the discovery of something fantastic, or the birth of a child. Others are literal maps encoded in the stars that someone with significant knowledge in astronomy could use to chart a path. Such tattoos typically lead to a location important to the giant's culture that is passed on through the generations. Some say these tattoos grant the giants power over life and death, though to the giants this power is more representative of life's cycles than anything resembling simple necromancy. ",
					"Eclipse of the Self. While interested in all manner of cosmological events, the one thing that truly stands at the forefront of eclipse giant culture is the tracking of both lunar and solar eclipses. During an eclipse of any kind the \"true self\" of every eclipse giant is unlocked. While the giant's \"true self\" is active they can access a part of their innermost being that is normally kept dormant. Some eclipse giants enter a violent frenzy, becoming nearly unkillable arbiters of death and destruction. Another might begin manically putting pen to parchment, creating written works of art that will define their culture for generations, all while another might be granted vast understanding of the cosmos and temporarily gain the capacity to quickly solve a complex astronomical formula that may have taken years to interpret otherwise. The \"true self\" of each eclipse giant is different, but it is something they all seek to access as frequently as possible and therefore the prediction of a coming eclipse is of the greatest importance to their species as a whole.

					"VARIABLE APPEARANCE. As created creatures, the appearance of chia golems span a wide array of varied forms. In noble courts or royal estates they often appear as giant rabbits, mice, lions, unicorns, dragons, or even statuesque armed guards. If created for a more sinister purpose they may appear as minotaurs, giant insects, or simply as faceless amalgams created with only utility in mind. More so than most golems, these creatures are truly a reflection of the one who crafts them. The other major factor in the appearance are the seeds planted within the creature. Most often various types of grass or hanging vines are used, however, some golems are created with seeds from plants with special qualities that can be floral, poisonous, bioluminescent, or even magical in nature. ",
					"HIGH MAINTENANCE. Unlike most other golems, chia golems require a high degree of upkeep in order to function properly. They must be kept hydrated and topped up with fertiliser to ensure the plants living within their housing are kept alive. This is a price many are willing to pay, however, since the initial cost of creating a chia golem is relatively low compared to other constructs. ",
					"DRUIDIC ORIGINS. Another way in which these golems differ from other golems is that instead of being created by clerics and wizards, chia golems have roots in the tradition of druidic magic. They were originally crafted to serve as guards for druid groves. Their appearance and ability to move at a near imperceptibly slow speed made them a natural fit for grove guardians. Some druids would even plant extremely dangerous plants with their golems such as yellow musk creepers or corpse flowers in their golems which would merge with the golem's magic, allowing the golem to control the plant's actions and making it infinitely more dangerous.

							"To create a chia golem one must first craft the body using clay. The clay is then baked in order to harden its form  into a permanent shape. This typically requires about 1,000 pounds of clay, though it can be more if the chosen form is exceptionally large. Once the body is crafted, it must be filled with soul and seeds of whatever variety the creator chooses. Then, by casting plant growth,  animate objects, and grasping vine on the body it will be  ready to become a golem. The final step is watering the golem regularly for one month until the seeds have matured and the golem rises on its own."

					"VARIABLE APPEARANCE. As created creatures, the appearance of chia golems span a wide array of varied forms. In noble courts or royal estates they often appear as giant rabbits, mice, lions, unicorns, dragons, or even statuesque armed guards. If created for a more sinister purpose they may appear as minotaurs, giant insects, or simply as faceless amalgams created with only utility in mind. More so than most golems, these creatures are truly a reflection of the one who crafts them. The other major factor in the appearance are the seeds planted within the creature. Most often various types of grass or hanging vines are used, however, some golems are created with seeds from plants with special qualities that can be floral, poisonous, bioluminescent, or even magical in nature. ",
					"HIGH MAINTENANCE. Unlike most other golems, chia golems require a high degree of upkeep in order to function properly. They must be kept hydrated and topped up with fertiliser to ensure the plants living within their housing are kept alive. This is a price many are willing to pay, however, since the initial cost of creating a chia golem is relatively low compared to other constructs. ",
					"DRUIDIC ORIGINS. Another way in which these golems differ from other golems is that instead of being created by clerics and wizards, chia golems have roots in the tradition of druidic magic. They were originally crafted to serve as guards for druid groves. Their appearance and ability to move at a near imperceptibly slow speed made them a natural fit for grove guardians. Some druids would even plant extremely dangerous plants with their golems such as yellow musk creepers or corpse flowers in their golems which would merge with the golem's magic, allowing the golem to control the plant's actions and making it infinitely more dangerous.

							"To create a chia golem one must first craft the body using clay. The clay is then baked in order to harden its form  into a permanent shape. This typically requires about 1,000 pounds of clay, though it can be more if the chosen form is exceptionally large. Once the body is crafted, it must be filled with soul and seeds of whatever variety the creator chooses. Then, by casting plant growth,  animate objects, and grasping vine on the body it will be  ready to become a golem. The final step is watering the golem regularly for one month until the seeds have matured and the golem rises on its own."

					"ROGUE SPECIES. Some Vril still work at the behest of their creators, due in part to the fact that they were genetically modified with magic making them  vulnerable to poison, a tool which their creators have access to in abundance. Despite this setback, the majority of Vril have since escaped the purpose originally intended for their species and have found themselves decidedly acclimated to life in The Underdark. Using their extremely sharp sense of hearing to navigate the cavernous geography of The Underdark, and their powerful shrieks  as a method of communication over vast distances, few vril can control wide areas of territory with relative ease.",
					"THOUGHTFUL COMBATANTS. Unlike standard goblins, Vril approach most problems with an inquisitive mind, and a level of situational awareness that even Hobgoblins can't help but admire. They will always try to observe an opponent and attempt to glean what kind of weaponry they are using before engaging with an enemy. This helps ensure that they can make proper use of their skinshift ability in order to shrug off strikes that would otherwise see them dead. They are fond of ambush tactics as well, making use of their powerful shrieks before jumping into battle with vicious intent. How the Vril fit in with the other goblinoid races still has yet to be seen, though some scholars believe they may possess the strength of both body and mind to challenge the Hobgoblins for dominance, and if they should manage to find common ground and cooperation, the enemies of goblinkind are bound to wind up in deep trouble.",
					"BLOODSWORN. Some vril have taken to dabbling in magic of their own, using it to rid themselves of the vulnerabilities thrust upon them by their creators. It is unclear precisely where the first bloodsworm came from, but many scholars believe these special members of vril society have entered into a collective pact with a more powerful entity. It is possible that this entity is Maglubiyet himself, the god of all goblins, and that this pact serves as not just a boon to the vril, but also as a formal vow of fealty to the god of goblinoids. Yet it is also possible that they have fond communion with some other entity, currently unknown to the wider world, and that they now serve a much darker purpose on behalf of something supremely sinister.

					"BORN OF THE LAND. Like many fey creatures, ruin chanters are spirits born of the land they occupy. Rather than being brought to life by the latent energy of an ancient forest or forgotten mountain, ruin chanters are made manifest by immense sadness, loss, and a profound sense of solitude. They are melancholic spirits who seek to preserve the dormant memories that lay trapped within aged ruins and abandoned places. They subsist on a diet of ash and dust, and they sleep on a bed of rubble. To them, these things are not only acceptable, but enjoyable. ",
					"ANCIENT PLACES. Ruin chanters can be found anywhere that once held life, but is now abandoned for one reason or another. Lost cities, ancient temples, and toppled fortresses are all among their favourite haunts. They protect these places with an unblinking vigilance. They care little about things happening outside of their domain, and will be openly hostile towards anyone they believe is seeking to raid their home for treasure. Such encounters usually end in death for the intruders, though the chanter typically won't cause undue suffering. They will simply do whatever they must to return the ruin to a state of undisturbed silence as fast as possible. If another creature enters the chanter's ruin with good intentions and conducts themselves with respect, the chanter may be willing to converse with them, and is very unlikely to attack unprovoked. ",
					"RESTORATION. Ruin chanters will abide the presence of any constructs, undead, or other creatures who naturally occupy their home. They will also tolerate creatures who enter the ruins with intent to restore or maintain them in some way, often making themselves known and actively cooperating with such individuals. They also seek out other ruin chanters for companionship, though such meetings are rare, and territory between chanter's is always respected. They communicate with one another over vast distances using esoteric songs sung in Sylvan. ",
					"MAGIC ITEMS",
					"Many ruin chanters have found powerful magic items within the places they inhabit. Consider what magic items a ruin chanter may have discovered in the ruin which it occupies, and consider adding them to the creature's stat block. Just keep in mind any items the creature is carrying may be looted by adventurers who best the creature in combat. "

					"GREED IS GOOD. Chromium dragons are among the most avaricious draconic creatures to ever walk the earth. Were it not for their rarity, they would likely be known as the greediest family of true dragons, even surpassing that of the notoriously covetous red dragons. The idea that they should dominate, procure, and otherwise possess anything and everything that falls beneath their gaze is the driving principle behind most chromium dragon schemes. Were it not for the slightly more powerful iron dragons keeping them in check, the unbounded desire for more within each chromium dragon would certainly spin out of control. ",
					"SHINY AND CHROME. Chromium dragons are born with scales that resemble a dull silver colour. As they age, their scales become more polished and reflective, ultimately becoming mirror-like. This has led to many instances where a chromium dragon is mistaken for a silver or mercury dragon, a mistake that often ends in disaster. Their shiny scales are not just for show, however. Chromium dragons use their scales in combat to get more varied angles on potential opponents, making them very difficult to sneak up on. They are also able to use magic in order to easily blend in with their surroundings. ",

					"Chromium dragons create lairs in frozen wastes and snow-capped mountains. They often use their icy breath to and magic to create frozen walls and structures that can accommodate them and their massive treasure hoard. The dragon's lair is also bound to be filled with dangerous traps and winding passageways of polished ice that make it extremely difficult for interlopers to navigate their way to the dragon's valuables, or escape if they happen to be so lucky. Chromium dragon lairs often include the following features; ",
					"Labyrinthine pathways with walls made from ice. ",
					"Reflective surfaces meant to confound and confuse. ",
					"A massive treasure hoard, even by draconic standards, all extremely well organised by category and function. ",

Each one of these monumental creatures is bound to have a hoard of treasure so large, it may be unrecognisable as such. Chromium dragons of this age and stature may consider entire kingdoms to be a part of their hoard, and all the treasure within them, and it is never enough. "

They are not a fiendish form that a lesser devil can be promoted into, but rather a lowly form that devils can be demoted to when they fail their superiors in some way. Transformation into a gulthir doesn't strip the devil of its identity or memories, and is not intended to be a permanent situation (most of the time). It is up to the newly demoted gulthir to once again prove themselves worthy of their station and earn back the status they once held. ",
					"FEARED BY ALL. Gulthirs are often put to work as a punitive force within fiendish society. They are feared by all lesser devils because they are one of the few creatures capable of completely destroying a devil, soul and all, even when they are not on their home plane of existence. When a gulthir swallows a creature, its digestive fluids have an effect similar to spells of domination on the victim, however, if the swallowed creature is a devil the gulthir can digest them and absorb their essence, completely destroying the original creature and empowering the gulthir. Gulthirs can also choose for a digested fiend to be reborn as another gulthir, which they will promptly disgorge as a crude means of propagating their species. ",
					"STATUS SYMBOLS. Treasure and magic items are seen as a symbol of status in most cultures, and the same is true among devils. Gulthirs greedily cling to any and all treasure they can find, adorning themselves in jewels and finery as a means of altering the perception of others to think more highly of them. They often carry trinkets in their gizzard that are especially precious in order to protect them from rivals."

If a phaerimm is ready to reproduce, anytime it hits a living creature with its tail attack and the target fails their save by 5 or more, the target is infected with a parasitic pharimm egg. If the egg is not removed by magic that can cure diseases, after 5d6 days the egg inside the creature will hatch and the newborn phaerimm will devour the ",

This has led to many tall tales about the groves inhabited by these fey creatures. Many locals who are unfamiliar with the ashira believe these places are haunted and the faint lights seen from the distance is created by unruly spirits. ",
					"Ashira, unlike dryads, are not beholden to a single tree. Instead, they are tied inexorably to the entire orchard of trees which they call home. Often these trees are tended to by other creatures who the ashira regale with song and dance as they take care of the trees in which they live. Ashira are incredibly friendly and enjoy the company of other ashira as well as any other creatures with whom they can converse and laugh. When the orchard is threatened, any ashira who live there act in unison to dismiss the threat, always preferring to knock an opposing creature unconscious and release them far from the grove over killing them.  They are able to move freely through their home with incredible speed thanks to the magic that binds them with the grove as a community. This communal nature goes beyond a mere preference for an ashira. If forced to live alone for some reason, they will become despondent and moody, seeking out connection with any creatures they can and trying to convince them to stay in their grove."

These creatures are often much less dangerous than a typical wizard's shackle as they have more understanding about what it is they are doing when they enslave another creature's mind, and as such, often choose to abstain from dominating others. Many even learn to work together with a host rather than assuming full control, sometimes even studying the arcane arts to develop their own spellcasting abilities. An evil archwizard shackle is, however, a tremendous threat to all who reside within its territory. Some of the most heinous acts committed by spellcasters are said to be attributed to the influence of an archwizard's shackle that has chosen a path of darkness. "
