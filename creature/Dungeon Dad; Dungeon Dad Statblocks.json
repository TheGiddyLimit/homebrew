					"Plush golems are constructs crafted to look like large stuffed animals. They can take a  wide variety of shapes and come in many different colors, however, one thing always remains true. If anyone should threaten their owner, there will be hell to pay. ",
					"The Gift That Keeps Giving. Plush golems are every parent's worst nightmare. They are typically given as gifts to young children, usually by obnoxious aunts or uncles. Plush golems seem like ordinary stuffed animals at first to most, but eventually reveal their animated state of being to the children who own them. As most children tend to treat their toy animals more like live creatures than playthings, it can become extremel;y frustrating for some parents as the child insists that the toy be allowed to eat at the dinner table, go along on outings, and take part in other family activities.",
					"Artisanal Playthings. Plush golems are finely crafted stuffed animals and may be formed from velvet, cotton, or wool. They are usually stuffed with cotton batting, but are sometimes partly filled with dried beans. They may be created in realistic colors to represent a real bear, panda, lion, or tiger, or they may be fabricated into fantastic creatures such as pink elephants, purple rabbits, or lime green monkeys.",
					"Fierce Guardians. While they are built to be soft and friendly, if the owner of a plush golem is ever threatened, the creature will spring into action and fight mercilessly to defend its master. Plush golems are often an unforeseen line of defense against would-be burglars, kidnappers, or other criminals. This makes them an ideal companion for children born into noble houses as they provide more protection than a mere body guard, and are often underestimated as simple toys."

					"YELLOW DRAGONS",
					"Selfish and cunning, yellow dragons hold dominion over seaside cliffs, salt flats, and coastal marshes. They are secretive and elusive in the extreme, opting to take a clever and subtle approach to problem solving rather than relying solely on draconic might. A yellow dragon is easily recognized by its elongated narrow jaws, oversized claws, and its slender body. Yellow dragons vary in color from brilliant hues of sunny yellow to flaxen shades of wheat. Their scales are much smaller than that of a typical dragon and are constantly being replaced, giving their skin a texture more akin to a snake than a lizard. This smooth scale pattern also allows them to more easily navigate through water and dirt. ",
					"The Missing Dragons. Ancient lore holds true that all the chromatic dragons were born from Tiamat, the queen of dragons. The more common varieties of chromatic dragon (white, black, red, green, and blue) were all made in the image of their mother, who has a draconic head of each color. However, there are other varieties of chromatic dragon that have a more mysterious origin. Purple, orange, and yellow dragons did not originate from Tiamat, but they certainly do exist. This quandary has divided scholars for ages, but there are two prevalent theories about their origin. Some think Tiamat may have experimented with her children before unleashing them upon the world, trying to create even stronger breeds. Secondary-color crossbreeds could have bred true with each other, starting new branches of the dragon family tree. Sages also speculate as to the possibility of another chromatic dragon deity, Tiamat's sister perhaps, arrayed with heads of yellow, orange, purple, and other crossbred colors. Tiamat may have destroyed her sibling eons ago, but not before the creation of dragons in the image of their deceased progenitor.",
					"Selfish. Yellow dragons are incredibly selfish, even by the standards of other chromatic dragons. Many scholars believe the primary reason they have become so obscure is due to the fact that during the war waged by dragons against the giants, the yellow dragons offered no help. In fact, yellow dragons were said to remove themselves from the conflict entirely, not willing to risk their lives for the benefit of their kind. This led to them being reviled by other dragons and ultimately to the destruction of many yellow dragon lands. To this day, the yellow dragons keep to themselves, knowing that should they ever make their presence known they will be surrounded by enemies. ",
					"Cunning Trappers. Unlike most other dragons, even in their oldest stages of life, the yellow dragon prefers to use ambush tactics and traps when engaging in battle. They are not as physically powerful as some of their other draconic cousins, but yellow dragons are extremely fast and capable of traveling through water, sand, and rock with relative ease. They use this unique mobility to their utmost advantage and will only ever take a fight they know will end in victory. A favorite trap of theirs is to dig a cone-shaped pit with steep sides, then bury themselves at the bottom. When prey inevitably stumbles into such a trap, the yellow dragon then moves its wings, causing the pit to collapse.",
					"Isolationist. Due to the fact that yellow dragons are hated by most for being dragons, and hated by other dragons for their actions throughout history, they have become quite isolated. They speak a strange dialect of Draconic unique to yellow dragons and will typically not learn any other languages since they have no desire to communicate with anyone outside of their own kind. This adds another layer of complexity to encountering a yellow dragon. If an individual approaches without an understanding of their language, even if they use magic such as the tongues spell to communicate, the yellow dragon is unlikely to trust or respect them."

The only way to remove the curse is the casting of a remove curse spell or equivalent during the victim's slumber while they are plagued with nightmares.

The legs are just as emaciated and overlong as the arms, with hooked toes to match. The head is imperceivable, enshrouded by a tangle of long, thick hair. From within the darkness of where the creature's face should be, two pitons of glowing white light suggest a malicious gaze. The Bagman has arrived.",
					"{@b {@i Beware the Bagman.}} Some say \"The Bagman\" is merely an urban legend. One version of the story tells of an adventurer who sought to escape certain death by abandoning his companions and hiding inside a bag of holding. Later, when he tried to leave the bag, he became lost amid a constantly increasing number of extra dimensional storage spaces. Over time, the strange forces of this magical in-between place transformed the adventurer into a monstrous creature. Now, every night, The Bagman slips out from a random bag of holding. If he doesn't find his home, he drags someone back into the bag with him and leaves behind some trinket from his hidden kingdom of lost junk. Some say that if you speak too loudly over an open bag of holding or whisper \"follow my voice\" into a magical storage space, space three times, The Bagman will come for you. Whether this is the true genesis of the bagman or not, the fact remains that a bagman is a very real threat, and a fate worse than death awaits those dragged into the realm from which they hail.",
					"{@b {@i \"Men\", Not \"Man\".}} The myth of The Bagman would suggest that there is only one \"Bagman\", however, the reality is much more sinister. When a bagman comes through a bag of holding into the material world, it does so in an attempt to find its way back to wherever it originally came from. When it is unsuccessful in finding its home, the creature always attempts to drag another sentient creature back with it into the bizarre realm it calls home, the \"Space Between Spaces\". If its kidnapping attempt is successful, it will typically abandon the creature before long as it continues its quest to find a way back home. Creatures who don't make it back to the material world will find themselves slowly twisted into a new bagman, destined to the same nightly ritual of obsessively trying to find their way back to where they came from. Why bagmen kidnap creatures is a mystery. Some scholars posit that it is a twisted reflex. That maybe they recognize their own perverse nature and a part of them hopes to be delivered from their predicament by somebody with their mind still intact. Others believe they do so at the behest of a dark entity, an unknown evil that is responsible for the creation of the first bagman who uses them as a means to gather twisted subordinates for some scheme that is yet to be revealed.",
					"{@b {@i The Space Between Spaces.}} For ages it was thought that the space inside a bag of holding was a self contained one, completely separate from the rest of the multiverse, but this is not so. All of these spaces are mere fragments of a much larger plane which scholars refer to as the \"Space Between Spaces\". Every extra-dimensional space such as that found within a bag of holding or portable hole connects to an isolated fragment of this bizarre demi-plane, but for the bagmen and other creatures native to the \"Space Between Spaces\", a bag of holding is not an isolated area, but a gateway to and from the material world. It is unclear if the first magic user to create a bag of holding truly knew what they were doing. Did they know they were linking our world with a nearly empty one governed by monsters? Or perhaps they never stopped to think that there might be something lurking on the other side. ",

The fiends also have a seemingly random number of translucent tentacles trailing from their backs, shoulders, and upper arms, which wave and weave through the air. Their bizarre forms possess heads that are skeletal, elongated, and vaguely piscine, reptilian, or canine, always bearing hungry rictus grins. Wicked, curved claws sprout from their hands and feet, and each creature's tail moves in rhythm with its tentacles, typically hanging toward the ground and almost doubling its length. They are particularly feared for their ability to consume and capture souls."

					"When a city grows corrupt, its people succumbing to degradation and decadence, the seams of the natural world can be split so that the evil of the Abyss  seeps through. A city corruptor is not a punishment for a people's lack of moral fortitude; it is a consequence. A natural predator of the urban environment, the city corruptor stalks the dark streets that are the arteries of the city it feeds on. As the city's weak and vulnerable begin to die in increasing numbers, this foul demon spreads fear among even the most powerful.",
					"Demonic Predation.  City corruptors appear in desperate, depraved, or hopeless urban centres. Places where the people either cannot reverse the moral decay of their city, or where they do not care to. A city corruptor is not attracted to combat. Rather, the demon lusts after the blood of victims lost to an environment shifting closer to collapse each day. To hasten the destruction of such an environment is every city corruptor's ultimate delight.",
					"The Portal Alignment. These sly demons first appeared in Zelatar, spreading quickly to other abyssal settlements. As a mortal city decays, the nature of an abyssal city aligns with it, and a city corruptor can step through the newly created gateway. Only one demon passes through during such an alignment. City corruptors fight among themselves for the exclusive right to claim a city in the mortal realm. Once a city is claimed, the corruptor gets to work. In the event that the city falls in its entirety, many of its people are sure to be dead, and the survivors along with the city itself are dragged into the Abyss, leaving behind a barren and lifeless dead spot in the Material Plane.",
					"Dead Spots. A dead spot is what gets left behind when a city is pulled into the Abyss. The dead spot appears as a soot-covered patch of land that always seems to be in the shade, even on the brightest day. It encompasses the entire area where the city was as well as the surrounding three miles. Nothing can or ever will grow in this place again. Dead spots are intrinsically linked to the Abyss, and as such, are often sought out by cultists and summoners who wish to draw on the power of demons. The only way to remove them is to sever the link by travelling to the Abyss, finding the demon responsible for the city's downfall, and killing them. ",
					"Demonic Kingpins. A city corruptor's primary means of achieving its goal is to wage a campaign of terror to destroy a city from within. They are extremely charismatic and will not hesitate to draw on their overwhelmingly magnetic personality traits to amass minions such as murderers, assassins, thieves, and other supernatural urban predators such as wererats or doppelgangers. When other demons come into the picture, however, the city corrupter refuses to share its plans with them as it seeks to be glorified as the only demon involved."

The beast's head rears up around the person's head, while its arms, hanging down from the warrior's shoulders, writhe like snakes ready to strike.",
					"Spawn of Madness Skinwalkers are born to serve Demogorgon, the demon lord, through a foul ritual. During this ritual, a priest of Demogorgon flays the skin of a living humanoid using a lash prepared from the claws and intestines of a demonic lion known as a jarilith. At the end of the process, the victim is burned alive on a pyre. However, just before the sacrifice perishes, the skin of the jarilith is thrown into the fire, at which point the two merge and become one. ",
					"Ancient Weaponry Many cults of Demogorgon have existed far before the current age of civilization. While most certainly mad, these cults often uphold the traditions that have prevailed since their inception, particularly in their tools of bloodshed. The macuahuitl is one such weapon. While not invented by one such cult, it was common use in the time when many cults of Demogorgon held their apex of power. A brutal weapon, the macuahuitl is a fine club crafted to house dozens of extremely sharp obsidian shards. This weapon is unparalleled in raw destructive power, however it is quite fragile, and often in the ferocity of battle the obsidian elements will break, crack, or find themselves in need of replacement.  ",
					"Natural Poisons Skinwalkers are fond of augmenting their attacks with poison. As survivalists they are extremely knowledgeable when discerning which plants and other natural elements can be used to inflict terrible pain. Their constant exposure to such substances has granted them a degree of resistance to their own poisons as well as a terrific offensive option."

This process takes 15 days, whereupon a small sliver of white appears on the left side and moves across the dragon until, 15 days later, it is all white again. The dragon's strength and alignment vary with its coloration. Each \"phase\" lasts seven days. When the dragon is all black, it is at full strength and lawful evil. When either black-white or white-black, its alignment is neutral evil. When all white, it is chaotic evil. When the moon dragon is all white, it holds sway over lycanthropes, and can even force them into their animalistic form."

To the astronomer, it may be a fascinating event, deserving of further study. However, to those aware of what beings lurk in the feywild, it is something to be feared. The eye of a namorrodor scours the land in search of prey. Almost panther-like in its behaviour, this gaunt, sleek predator searches for unfortunate souls. Using its ability to sense the waning life energy of those on death's door, the namorrodor hopes for an easy kill. ",
					"Meteor Spirits.",
					"A namorrodor spends much of its time resting in the feywild. There it remains, until the sun sets on the world of mortals. When the hour grows dark, the namorrodor emerges from its home to hunt. These creatures are often referred to as meteor spirits due to the fact that as they stalk the night sky their glowing yellow eyes are often mistaken for the light of distant stars or other bright objects seen in the heavens above. ",
					"Cautious Killers.",
					"These fey have four eyes, one set that glows a sickly yellow, and another that emanates a pale white light. This pair of white eyes allows them to detect and examine the life energy of mortal beings. They use these eyes to hunt prey that are easily taken down, and as a way of avoiding groups of strong enemies. Often their targets are quite elderly or very young. For this reason communities that exist nearby active openings to the feywild know to safeguard their young and elderly during nightfall. The other favourite hunting ground of the namorrodor is the battlefield after some kind of great conflict. Often soldiers and mercenaries are not well versed in the legends of the meteor spirits, making their wounded a prime target for such creatures.  ",
					"Lone Hunters.",
					"Namorrodor hunt by themselves almost exclusively. It is exceedingly rare to see more than one of these creatures hunting at the same time. The only exception to this rule is when a pair of namorrodor have formed a mating bond and are seeking to build a new nest to raise their young before going their separate ways. In such instances, the pair will work together to gather as much food as possible, and will act with aggression unusual even for their kind."

					"It was the most peculiar thing. The sun was high in the summer sky, the weather temperate and mild. Yet the farmers across the town fervently began to usher their animals inside. The braying of beasts could be heard in all directions, as not a farmhand stood idle, working towards a combined effort the likes of which I've never seen. Surely this town was far and away from my homeland, but I wouldn't imagine the way food is grown and animals tended to be much different here than anywhere else. I was wrong. I was finally able to grab the attention of a young man who had just finished ushering his cattle into shelter, he nearly jumped out of his skin when I grabbed his shoulder. \"What in the hells!\" he exclaimed, before realizing there was no danger. I asked him what all the fuss was about, and he simply replied \"It's coming\". What was I supposed to make of that? I looked all around, confused, seemingly the only sane individual for miles on end. Then suddenly, it was quiet. Everyone had gone inside. Not a soul in the streets to be seen. I made haste towards the inn, my home away from home these past few days. Perhaps someone there would be of assistance in clearing up my ignorance to whatever the issue at hand was. I walked up the creaky wooden steps, a faint breeze blowing through the bushes. Locked. I knocked for what seemed like a good few minutes before I got any response. The wind began to pick up. \"Mister, you better find somewhere to hide\" a small voice came from the other side of the door. This simply added to my confusion, but I was starting to get concerned. My horse, who was tied up near the watering trough began to cause a stir. The wind was becoming worrisome. How in the nine hells had these people known a storm was brewing on such a clear day. The polite knocking turned to pounding. Something was wrong. I could practically cut through this feeling with a dagger. A voice deep inside of me screamed it was no longer safe. I started to panic. What was happening? The wind was now howling, yet the clouds showed no sign of tempest. At this very moment I heard the door unlatch, and a small boy was standing there, a disgruntled looking father over his shoulder. \"Come in if yer comin' in\" bellowed the man as the boy grabbed my arm and guided me towards shelter. Just as I passed over that threshold, I saw, for the briefest moment, something I'm not fully sure I can describe. The sun was blotted out of the sky. At mid day, it became night. A shadow cast over the entire town. The wind became so violent, trees struggled to keep themselves within the dirt. Then there was that sound. A low, gut wrenching tone vibrated the very structure I stood upon. As the innkeep secured the door behind us, I rushed to the window. Pressed against the floor, revealing as little of myself as possible, I peered through the wooden reinforcements that covered most of the window. What I saw, was my horse. He was sailing through the air, grasped in the clutches of a monster the likes of which I have never conceived. The look on my face must have betrayed my state, as the boy sidled over to me, answering the question that would not escape my lips. In a soft tone, he simply said, \"Diablotra\". ",

Those who have actually seen the twisted land find themselves mute upon its mention. They speak only cryptic warnings of things so absurd, you'd have to be a madman to conceive them.

Then, there's the most outlandish of them all. The living tsunami. The monstrosity so large it could snap a ship in two with a single claw as though it were a mere splinter. The protector goddess of the golden shores. Praesigira. As if something so outlandish could actually exist. Surely the only reason this island paradise has not been conquered is because it simply doesn't exist. Or, does it? Remember when I said this exotic locale has found no purchase inked on parchment? I lied. For there was one man, one absolutely broken man, who came back from the edge of the world. He hasn't said a word since he washed up on shore. He simply trembles, eyes bulging, frantically looking in all directions. Clutched In his hand as his wretched form met the docks? A finely crafted scrap of lambskin.

					"Perfectly Balanced. Possessing both celestial and demonic heritage, the concordant killers are beings of pure neutrality. Some say concordant killers were an experiment by gods of neutrality, who sought to create the perfect stewards for maintaining the cosmic balance. Others hold that they were created by a long-forgotten demigod to serve as bodyguards. It is theorised that, whatever their original purpose, they failed in that endeavour, and their master was lost to a cosmic rival. Left without direction, they settled into the role of mercenaries. Whatever the truth, as beings of neutrality, concordant killers are concerned with the balance of all forces in the planes. They understand that defeating a powerful foe might tip the scales one way or another. Therefore they track their kills as a group, endeavouring to distribute their prey evenly among the the forces of the multiverse. . They keep the location of such meetings secret, though many sages believe they congregate near the central spire of the Outlands. Even deities' magic is impeded there, making it a perfect spot for clandestine gatherings.",
					"The Last of Their Kind. Concordant killers do not reproduce, so every one that falls in battle forever reduces their number. Anyone who destroys a concordant killer inevitably becomes the target of its irate and vengeful kin. They exist in their current state to hunt down and destroy other powerful creatures. Effective yet discreet, they are highly sought after by powerful entities such as demon lords, demigods, and even deities to do their dirty work. A concordant killer is dismissive of any prospective employer, though, unless offered substantial payment.  Concordant killers trade their services for favours, having little need for material possessions. Sometimes they request these favours at the time of hiring, but usually a contract for future payment suffices. Even gods are indebted to the concordant killers and so might look the other way, leave a planar portal open, provide information on a target's whereabouts, or undertake other favours that help the killers achieve their objectives. In the case of a recent death among their ranks, the favour may include the resurrection of a fallen comrade. ",

					"Spawn of Madness Skinwalkers are born to serve Demogorgon, the demon lord, through a foul ritual. During this ritual, a priest of Demogorgon flays the skin of a living humanoid using a lash prepared from the claws and intestines of a demonic lion known as a jarilith. At the end of the process, the victim is burned alive on a pyre. However, just before the sacrifice perishes, the skin of the jarilith is thrown into the fire, at which point the two merge and become one. ",
					"Ancient Weaponry Many cults of Demogorgon have existed far before the current age of civilization. While most certainly mad, these cults often uphold the traditions that have prevailed since their inception, particularly in their tools of bloodshed. The macuahuitl is one such weapon. While not invented by one such cult, it was common use in the time when many cults of Demogorgon held their apex of power. A brutal weapon, the macuahuitl is a fine club crafted to house dozens of extremely sharp obsidian shards. This weapon is unparalleled in raw destructive power, however it is quite fragile, and often in the ferocity of battle the obsidian elements will break, crack, or find themselves in need of replacement.  ",
					"Natural Poisons Skinwalkers are fond of augmenting their attacks with poison. As survivalists they are extremely knowledgeable when discerning which plants and other natural elements can be used to inflict terrible pain. Their constant exposure to such substances has granted them a degree of resistance to their own poisons as well as a terrific offensive option."

Such swarms are real threats in larger cities, where they infest the magic districts and threaten to claim entire shops that deal in anything magical if not quelled. Although they cannot consume the magical energy stored in magic items, the auras of such items still attract mageripper swarms, much as a candle flame attracts moths. The confused and hungry creatures mill about the item until  they are destroyed or find something else to eat. Consuming magical energy allows the creatures to reproduce, increasing the swarm's size. Individual swarm members live only for a year or so, but when the swarm devours magic, its constituent creatures can double their numbers within days. They reproduce asexually, with young budding from the backs of the adults.",

Other creatures sometimes  use them to defend against magical assaults. These keepers often cast spells on a helpless captive or capture and bind a spellcaster, leaving the prisoner as food within the swarm's territory. Magerippers are sentient, although their intelligence is no more the cunning of a predator. They are capable of adapting their tactics to fit new circumstances. Though driven largely by the instinct to feed and reproduce, mageripper swarms can modify their behaviour in response to stimuli."
