Infernal embers shine in his orbs, and a layer of flames engulfs the oar as it strikes the waters of Acheron or the souls who crowd the ship. His voice makes the whole universe tremble, stirs the waters, and plants the seeds of dread in every heart. When Caronte the Demon steps on the shore, the earth trembles. As he rises, his bent back and his white beard are those of an ancient man, but his countenance is so fierce that it vanquishes any attempt at courage. This is the power of an Infernal Keeper, the sheer force that allows him to enact eternal justice in the name of the Lord. ",

Their bat-like wings allow them to glide and flit from one end of the vessel to the other, as quick as the wind, with skittish movements like those of an insect.",

He spends his time howling at the damned and sowing fear without ever leaving his precious boat. From time to time, he hits the Lost Ones who bother him most with his oar, but he rarely means to kill.",

His first reaction is a reaction of bewilderment, sometimes he is even amused by the courage shown by the stowaway. Then he orders his helmsmen under the deck, so that he may act freely. Then his face grows dark and a black smoke rises from his clenched jaw. Now he is ready to fight.",
					"Let it be known that fighting with Caronte is an act of sheer madness.",
					"Still, if someone manages to prove their worth and defeats him, Caronte will submit to the heavenly will that led his foes to him.",

Gerione could become whatever it wished. But now that the Infernal cliff is its lair, now that its shifting shape is wreathed in darkness, Gerione is just Gerione. It has the face of a bearded man whose eyes have been blinded by the boiling blood of Flegetonte. Its body is slithering, huge, endless: the body of a dragon as large as a river, twisting on itself in darkness. Gerione is so huge that I may easily lay down on one of its eyelids.",

					"A good way to fight Gerione is to jump on its back and to climb up to its head. Gerione will not realize there is a Lost One crawling on its back until the Lost One attacks. Climbing up the monster's body is not easy, as Gerione keeps moving and the scales are made slippery by the blood, but this is the best option you have. Its coils are immune to most weapons. In addition, it is not harmed by the Flegetonte, and it often dives under the waterfall to shed the vermin away. Cling to its scales with all your strength when it soars in the sky, or get ready to jump down when it dives against a wall or into the scorching sand.",

The spirals on its body spin and open, releasing dozens of crawling arms which try to grapple those who have wounded it.",
					"When Gerione realizes it is about to lose the fight, it begins to speak. Then you only need to ask it for passage to the bottom of the chasm and your task is done."

Earth and sky were closer, and the heavens opened to let the children of the Lord pass. But an ancient sin wiped away that world in forty days and forty nights, so that a new world could rise. The beings imprisoned in the Pit are the last survivors of that age, the rebellious and unholy spawn of two realities that should never have merged. Nembrot, Fialte, Anteo, Tizio, Tifone, and Briareo. Giants.",

In her dungeon, Medusa rules unchallenged and can tear to pieces and devour anyone. Her aspect is unknown, as those who have seen her face can no longer tell what they saw. She has vipers as hair and her hands end with bronze claws. To meet her gaze is certain death: your semblance will immediately turn into stone. Being a Traveler, your new semblance will soon appear next to the closest source of the divine flame, but you will lose part of your Hope. You must thus fight without ever letting Medusa get in your line of sight, or just fight blindfolded. You can see the gorgon without being petrified only through her reflections, so you can use a mirror or a liquid surface to detect her. Fortunately, there are more than enough barrels you can smash in the dungeon, to make a few reflecting pools. The infernal Medusa, though, will not sit idly by in the meanwhile."

					"You are almost swept away by a sharp, cruel wind smelling of brimstone. Every gust also carries the painful breath of something huge, a hate so strong that it drains every color from creation. The landscape of Hell grows grey, then it darkens to the point that your sight is limited to a small cone surrounded by a layer of thick darkness. You glimpse some figures on the frozen walls, and suddenly a mountain appears in front of you, enshrouded in flames that shine in the eternal night. But you know very well that this is no mountain. You step forward, out of Giudecca's maze, and you come to the place where the Morning Star fell. Lucifero stops his wings, as if he were surprised by your arrival, and your sight returns. You feel compelled to bow your head, maybe in awe, maybe in horror: This is Lucifero, the Foe, the Devil, the Tempter, Emperor of Hell, Ninth and Last Keeper of this place. Lucifero's shape is so huge that your eyes can hardly take in the magnitude of the figure before you. A shadow emerges from the frozen lake, a head as high as a peak. Oh, what a glorious sight the Light Bearer had to be in the highest of heavens, if his twisted shape is now so fearful!Still, even more than his semblance, you are stricken by the foul energy constantly radiating from his shape. You are so close to him that only the presence of the Divine Flame prevents you from collapsing to the ground and abandoning every Hope. Keep as close as you can to the Flame, Travelers, as that light is the last bastion shielding your mind from Lucifero, the only thing that preserves your sanity. There are no words in this world to describe how it feels to be in the presence of the Great Foe. I will therefore use a metaphor to convey at least a fragment of the Evil brooding at the center of Cocito. Lucifero is an oozing wound, whose foul ichor taints all men. He is a mass of men and women melted together in an agonizing tower of torn flesh, so high as to pierce the starry sky. He is a son who smiles as he slowly pushes a blade into his father's belly. Lucifero eternally gnaws his damned. He does not look at you, although it is obvious that he noticed your arrival. Each of those damned looks familiar to you. Maybe they are someone you know, or someone you have heard about. Giuda, Bruto, Cassio, or maybe someone close to you. Maybe they're your father or your sister. They wail, begging you to save them, longing for relief, aid, Hope. You will not yield. This was all done on purpose. Everything was planned from the beginning, since your journey began. All the Familiar Spirits you invoked, all the Hope you spent during your journey, it was all a scheme to lose you, to consume you, to provoke your fall... You ignore their pleas and focus on the divine light. You search for Hope within yourselves, and rise again. Now the real battle begins. Lucifero can beat his wings to create buffets of frozen wind that can lift you into the air and cast you aside, covering your shapes with ice. When he hits the frozen lake with his fists, he generates an earthquake, opening fissures and raising sharp blades of ice. You cannot even conceive of the possibility of killing Lucifero himself. The Devil is immortal, his existence sustains the very structure of Hell. You can only hope to weaken him enough to bypass him before it's too late, and even this opportunity is the hardest of all tasks... Lucifero enjoys every distraction from his punishment, so he will toy with you and torture you in creative ways. Actually, this will play to your advantage. If he actually wanted to vanquish you, you would not stand a chance, so seize this opportunity. His overconfidence will be once again his downfall."
