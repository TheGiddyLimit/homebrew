						"Many of us have experienced something like this before; I know I have countless times over the years, both as a player and game master. The book you hold in your hands right now is a key ingredient in keeping your game time fresh and engaging. Sure, as a player it's helpful to know everything about the creature you encounter, but, in my opinion, that misses a big part of what's enjoyable in a fantasy roleplaying game. The first time we took up dice and pencil in search of adventure, the whole multiverse was new and unknown. Wonderment permeated the entire experience, increasing the excitement and ensuring we embarked upon a collective hero's journey with the rest of the players.",
						"My earliest childhood memories are being around the gaming table playing games with my dad. Hearing him describe the dungeon environment as our group of intrepid adventures delved below Castle Greyhawk enthralled me completely. The air was thick with tension as we carefully explored. I didn't know what we were going to discover around the corner or behind the next door, but I knew there was danger lurking somewhere. And when we did eventually encounter a creature in that subterranean setting, we didn't know what it was or any of its capabilities. This formula heightened the suspense, focusing our attention on this puzzle that was an unknown creature. And it set conditions for my father, as the game master, to reveal the monster's powers with dramatic effect. These early experiences helped cement my love of gaming that has remained unquelled for well over forty years. The {@i Tome of Beasts 3}, with its over four hundred new creatures, can help you have the same experience, piquing your players' attention and horrifying the hearts of your know-it-alls!",
						"My daughter Miriam and I are fortunate enough to have a creature we created grace the pages of the {@i Tome of Beasts 3}. It was a wonderful experience to relive one of the things I enjoyed so much with my dad\u2014creating new things! We fleshed out the basics of the {@creature haakjir|ToB3} as we hiked around one of the many hills near our home in Calabasas, CA. She wanted a beast that could climb up and down stone like a fossa, a carnivorous mammal that inhabits Madagascar. We bounced ideas off of each other and by the time the walk was done, I discovered I had a well of creative energy ready. Her fresh outlook and entertaining discussion gave me a new perspective.",
						"I posit to you, my fellow roleplaying game enthusiast, that preserving or reinvigorating the sense of the unknown, the wonderment felt by your players, will help renew them and propel your game experience to even greater heights. When we encounter something new, we have to focus on it in order to discover and understand it. The result is players are more present, and dare I say, phones lie forgotten beside them, as they focus on figuring out how best to resolve the situation you have presented to them. There are many tools available to level up your game from miniatures and terrain to virtual tabletops and story props, but for me, one of the best techniques to keep players fully engaged is the wonderment of new challenges\u2014keep them on their toes and the fun will follow!",

It feasts on insects, especially those attracted to bloody wounds on other creatures. A particularly hungry jeholopterus might take this a step further by making its own fresh wounds. After landing on a suitable target and securing itself with its hand and foot claws, the jeholopterus latches on with its fangs. It then uses its plier-like jaws to squeeze the wound and keep the blood flowing to attract insects."
