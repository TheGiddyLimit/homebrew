				"The journey to becoming an Apotheosis always begins with kindness. Clerics that strive towards lichdom will be the ones that most zealously commit themselves to charity, to alms-giving, to philanthropy.The goal is to become a pillar in the communities they inhabit, and to pass on their message at the time where people are most susceptible to hear it. An Apotheosis cannot exist without followers, because belief and devotion are what make an Apotheosis' existence possible. But a cleric knows how hard it is for a group of people to truly devote themselves to serving someone else, which is why the Apotheosis is a cleric in the first place.",
				"Kindness, charity, and, most importantly, religion are the Trojan horses that a cleric wishing for lichdom uses to form a cult. The god or domain they worship is a means to an end; they add one key ingredient to the doctrine they teach their followers: the cleric themselves. The Apotheosis-to-be positions themselves as the key, and the only way, to truly worship their chosen god. Without the Apotheosis' guiding hand, without the shepherd to lead the sheep, the believers would be helpless, their worship fruitless, their prayers unanswered, and so, a cult is born. A cult with a religious belief and a leader to guide them.",
				"The cleric then works towards entrenching themselves further and further as the sole authority in the cult, and, slowly but surely, shifts more and more of the cult's focus from worshiping a god to worshiping the cleric. Once the cult is devoted in mind, body, and soul to the cleric, the ritual may begin.",
				"A lich cannot be a lich in life, and so the cleric must end theirs in a ritual, alongside their most trusted cultists. These cultists themselves play a key part in said ritual, as their sacrifice is what actually empowers the ritual. The rest of the cult, however, does not sit idly by. Over the course of the establishment of the cult, the cleric must have manipulated their flock into believing, without a shred of doubt, that their leader will come back to life. The cult's belief that their leader is immortal is, in and of itself, what makes a cleric lich immortal. If enough people believe them to be immortal, the cleric will rise again from the ritual as an Apotheosis, a true lich.",
				"An Apotheosis will never truly die as long as enough people believe them to be immortal. Their worshippers are their phylactery, and they are referred to as martyrs.",
				"Upon learning what it takes to create an Apotheosis, one might think that only those clerics devoted to evil deities can ever become such monsters, but there are many stories of clerics devoted to neutral or even good gods who have achieved Apotheosis. There are even whispers among the highest echelons of the most powerful churches that some gods themselves have assisted in the creation of Apotheoses of their own religion. After all, the existence of an Apotheosis ensures that there is an undying cleric highly motivated to spread the worship of the god they chose, potentially forever. The perfect tool to grow a god's influence further and higher than any other."

				"When we think of immortality, many of us think not of people, but of the land. Long after we're dead and buried, the trees that grow on that same soil will feast on our bodies and grow ever stronger -- perennial, immortal. But no one knows how delicate the life of nature is more than the ones who guard it. Nature needs to maintain a constant balance to thrive, to survive, and it only takes someone willing to put that balance at risk for their own selfish motives to destroy it, and kill the land that relies on them to remain immortal.",
				"Nature cannot defend itself from these attacks, but its druidic guardians can, and when one of these druids is unable to fight off the destruction of the land the druid protects, a Blight is born.",
				"Through a particularly lengthy ritual, the druid melds both their soul and their body to the land they are trying to protect: killing the druid, creating a phylactery, and giving rise to a Blight. Unlike other liches, a Blight's phylactery is not housed in an object, or even another living being. The Blight's phylactery is called a Death Bloom, and it's not an object or a person, but a place. A place at the heart of the space the druid sought to protect, the place where the ritual to become a Blight was performed. This ritual requires such extreme control over nature that only Archdruids are known to have performed it successfully.",
				"A Blight's goal when turning to lichdom is not to extend their own lifespan, but rather to share their immortality and, more importantly, their will, with the land they seek to protect at all costs. In melding the druid's soul with the land, they give the land a way to defend itself against its enemies. The will of the druid and the will of the land are now one and the same, and they can now fight back as one against any threat with a much darker, more powerful magic.",
				"In a sense, both the druid and the land have achieved lichdom together, the druid becoming a Blight and the land they have decided to meld with often called a Memorial.",
				"Memorials and the Death Bloom phylacteries at their center are as varied as the druid who created them when embracing lichdom. Lichdom transforms Memorials into places where nature grows in an unnatural way. Fungi growing tens of feet high, vines that extend for miles, or flowers that cover every surface as far as the eye can see. A Memorial has its own will, and because it is born out of a need to defend itself, it can fight back against those that wish to destroy it, with its mushrooms releasing deadly spores, its vines using their thorns as weapons, or its flowers scattering poisonous pollen. Similarly, the Blight who inhabits a memorial can manifest a semblance of their body anywhere in the memorial as a more concentrated form of defense against intruders, creating a body out of lichen, moss, or flowers anywhere in the Memorial.",
				"When a druid turns to lichdom and becomes a Blight, they accomplish their goal of protecting the land they were watching over, but in so doing they also doom nature and anything else that isn't part of their Memorial. In order for the Blight and their Memorial to continue to live in their unlife, they must continuously grow and expand. A Blight and the land they have melded their soul with is less of a thriving grove and more a cancerous growth that absorbs anything at its border as it grows to perpetuate its unlife. It consumes and incorporates anything in its vicinity, including other lands. Thriving and diverse ecosystems get taken over and flattened into the homogenous Memorial. The Memorial remains untouched by the hands of man and any that wished it harm, but when seeing the constant consumption of the Memorial and the destruction of nature at its borders, one has to ask the Blight: was it worth it?"

				"Even achieving undeath is not enough for a fighter to actually become a Death March. Death Marches are liches that achieve true undeath by conscription.",
				"A fighter who seeks undeath as a way to unnaturally extend their life must undergo a long journey marked by death at every step. Their ritual to achieve lichdom consists in challenging fellow masters of the fighting arts, those who have mastered all different styles used in battle, and ending their lives. Once they've slain the last one of these fighters, there's just one last fighter to put to the sword: themselves.",
				"If the foes they've fought against proved to be worthy opponents, the fighter will rise again in undeath, but not as a true lich. Their bodies won't decay and they'll retain the faculties and fighting prowess they had in life, but they will find true death if slain, as they don't yet have a phylactery. The second stage of achieving true lichdom can then begin: conscription.",
				"The undead fighter must continue to slay worthy opponents. If slain by the fighter, these opponents rise in undeath too as unliving puppets of the undead fighter, retaining all fighting abilities they had in life. These are the undead fighter's phylacteries. This is what constitutes a Death March lich.",
				"The Death March amasses a veritable army of undead, armed forces of the dead that follow its every command. The more are conscripted into the Death March, the stronger the Death March grows, and the more options for a phylactery the lich has if slain. Any member of the Death March can house the soul of the lich. But there's a catch.",
				"All members of the Death March must remain in relative proximity of each other to stay undead, which stops the lich from stashing away corpses in remote locations to use as emergency phylacteries, but that isn't the reason why a Death March must constantly add new members to its undead forces. The body currently housing the soul of the lich is the only body free from decay; all other members of the Death March, though undead, slowly rot away. The wounds sustained in combat don't close with time: they are, in a way, in a slow death march of their own, crawling towards true death. If a Death March wishes to continue to enjoy the benefits of lichdom, it must constantly add new members to its forces.",
				"This makes Death Marches, paradoxically, one of the types of lich that is most active in the goings-on of the living, as they thrive when geopolitical conflict arises. Death Marches are the first to the battlefield when war erupts between two nations, and many Death Marches stoke the flames of war themselves, pushing conflicts to escalate into all-out war so they may find more conscripts to their army.",
				"Most civilized societies see the use of Death Marches in armed conflict as deeply inhumane, seeing as those who fall to the undead's swords aren't even afforded the meager comfort of resting in death, but few are above using them when truly desperate. When the enemy is at your doorstep and all hope is lost, who is above accepting any help? Even if it's the help of death itself.",
				"And so, Death Marches become an eternal standing army, constantly traveling in search for new members to add to their death battalions, robbing more and more fighters of their final rest until they rot away or their body becomes the new vessel of the commander who conscripted them into service beyond death."

				"Forsworn are born in the same way all paladins are born: with an oath.",
				"A Paladin seeking lichdom swears an oath, an undying oath. Most times paladins do not forsake their previous oath when taking on an undying oath, but those that do become oathbreakers before ascending to lichdom. The ritual where a paladin lich becomes a Forsworn is simply called by other Forsworn as the accolade. In it, the paladin is knighted anew. The sword used in the accolade is rested on both of the shoulders of the paladin, and then plunged into their chest, piercing the paladin's heart and ending their life as a paladin, rising then as a Forsworn, beholden to their new undying oath.",
				"To those familiar with lichdom and unfamiliar with the ways of the Forsworn, this might seem quite effortless when compared to the way others achieve lichdom. This could not be further from the truth, for Forsworn are liches that achieve lichdom communally.",
				"There is no lone Forsworn, there is only an order of Forsworn. Forsworn exist only in groups sworn to the same oath, serving as knights under the same banner. Each member of a Forsworn order must swear the oath, and more importantly, believing most fervently. Just like a paladin gains incredible powers from believing and abiding by their oath, a Forsworn gains true undeath through swearing off life, rejecting the respite of death, and doing so as a group of paladins. This ensures that selfish or just personal reasons behind achieving lichdom are off the table for Forsworn, as each must swear the same oath and believe in it with all their will. The exact number of paladins needed to swear the same undying oath is unknown, a closely guarded secret by Forsworn orders, but new paladins can join an existing Forsworn order, strengthening their numbers and, paradoxically, making each member's existence as a Forsworn harder.",
				"Forsworn look the same as they did in life, except for the unhealing wound in their chest taken during the accolade ritual, but if members of the order are killed, their appearance gradually deteriorates. The more members of an order die, the more decomposed the surviving members look, until the last surviving member of a Forsworn order is a walking skeleton wearing the armor of the order.",
				"But the death of order members is not merely a matter of aesthetics for Forsworn, it's a matter of life and death. Just like lichdom is communal for Forsworn, so is their key to eternal unlife. Each member of the Forsworn order is, in turn, a phylactery of the members in the same order. This arrangement ensures that as long as one existing member of the Forsworn order still stands, the others will come back to the world of the living.",
				"But Forsworn are knights, creatures of action. They may fight in gorey battlefields, or take part in bloody skirmishes and dangerous missions, either to uphold the original oath they made before they became Forsworn, or, more commonly, to feed on the souls of their enemies, the sustenance to their unlife which all members share communally within an order. However, each of these dangerous battles and incursions threaten to be the end of that particular Forsworn. If this does indeed happen, all other members of the order must then congregate in the same space, and swear their oath again. This is the reason why Forsworn orders don't grow into the hundreds of members. Maintaining a Forsworn order in the hundreds will take the same amount of souls regardless of how many Forsworn are currently alive, and gathering all of the living members under the same roof to bring those that died back would prove impossible past a certain number of knights.",
				"Existence within a Forsworn order proves to be a particularly challenging tightrope to walk on, both because there is no shortage of actual paladins that have made it their own oath to put an end to all undead, and also because of the complex ways in which their existing oath might conflict with the reality of existing as a lich that needs to reap souls for sustenance.",
				"Regardless of why a new order of Forsworn decided to walk this treacherous path, Forsworn are created by a group of people believing so strongly in their commitment to an oath that they manage to transcend the bindings of life and death. This, along with their communal nature which is extremely rare in other liches, makes Forsworn both powerful allies and terrifyingly powerful enemies."

				"When we think of immortality, many of us think of achieving it through our legacy. Continuing the family line, becoming parents and raising a new generation so that a part of us may live on in them. Hierarchs take that to its extreme conclusion. If their bloodline remains strong, if it passes down from one generation to the next uninterrupted, what lives on is not just their legacy, but themselves.",
				"A Sorcerer who wishes to become a Hierarch has perhaps one of the harshest journeys to achieve lichdom in front of them. A hopeful Hierarch will have to go through a particularly complicated and painful ritual with one goal in mind: to bind their souls to their blood. Hierarchs turn the blood running through their veins into their own phylactery.",
				"The specifics of this ritual differ by blood type and sorcerous magic. It's not uncommon for a Hierarch-to-be to go through it several times, expecting to die during their failed attempts and requesting the help of a cleric to be brought to life so that the sorcerer can try again. The process is arduous, but the fruits of the labor are worth it. Once completed, the Hierarch's blood and soul become one, and then, the true work begins.",
				"The Hierarch will then ensure that their blood is passed on to their descendants. Their children, and their children in turn, will all be living phylacteries to the Hierarch. As long as they live, the Hierarch won't die.",
				"Those descendants enjoy the sorcerous powers of the Hierarch, becoming incredibly powerful spellcasters in their own right, and the Hierarch in turn gains power over them.  A Hierarch gives their bloodline a poisoned gift. Anyone with the Hierarch's cursed blood running through their veins is not only the Hierarch's phylactery, but also their puppet. The descendants might be incredibly powerful, but they must all answer to the Hierarch's will,  whether they want to or not. This allows the Hierarch to have the power of their entire sorcerous family protecting them.The more descendants there are, the more phylacteries of the Hierarch exist, and the more people there are to defend and enact the Hierarch's will.",
				"But with each generation, the Hierarch's blood becomes thin. The more generations are removed from the Hierarch, the less control the Hierarch has over them, and the less blood they share. After enough generations, the Hierarch loses the strength to retain their physical form, turning into the Hierarch's version of a Demilich, called a Figure Head. Once the last of the Hierarch's descendants that still have the Hierarch's blood coursing through their veins dies, so does the Hierarch. But Hierarchs have fought too hard for immortality to let this stop them. When they feel their powers waning with the passing generations, they start to work on a different, even darker ritual. They select one of their descendants, a particularly powerful one, one with access to great amounts of sorcerous magic. Hierarchs call this descendant their Heir, and pamper them and train them to ensure that their magical abilities grow as strong as possible, almost rivaling theirs. Once the Heir is sufficiently strong, the ritual may commence. The Hierarch sheds their mortal body and possesses the body of the heir,  using the phylactery-like blood that runs through the heir's veins as an anchor for their soul. Once the process is complete, the Hierarch's journey begins again as they have gained a new body. They strengthen their bloodline again, ensuring that it passes down the generations, preserving their immortality and gaining the support of a powerful magical lineage that can do nothing but obey their every word. When going against a Hierarch, you go against them and their entire bloodline."

Pouring a glass for those that are not there, reminiscing about the moments we spent with them, we call these rituals ways to \"keep their memory alive\". We understand that this is a way to extend the life of someone past their lifespan.",
				"Intoners understand this too, and take it to its logical extreme. If they can manage to live in the memories of those around them, if they can make people wish they would live forever, they will never truly vanish, never truly die.",
				"The process in which a bard becomes an intoner starts with, of course, a song. They call this melody their Magnum Opus, and an hopeful intoner can spend decades writing it. This is no simple musical piece, but a verbal spell in the shape of a song, an arcane melody. The rituals needed to make a magnum opus vary by discipline and by culture, but the effects are the same. A true magnum opus carries a piece of the bard's soul within it, as long as someone remembers the melody, the intoner can't really die.",
				"Once their magnum opus is finished, the intoner-to-be travels and plays their arcane song to those willing to listen. For some, this arcane song will resonate in a particular frequency, an earworm that will wriggle its way into their brain forever. They will never forget the intoner's song, and in turn will never forget the intoner themselves.",
				"To ensure their full transformation into a true intoner, the bard will die when they feel enough people have heard their magnum opus. Intoners call this their swan song: the last performance a bard will give in life before dying and rising again as an intoner.",
				"Those that have heard the magnum opus will then act as the intoner's living phylacteries. For as long as they live, the memory of the intoner will live with them. If the intoner dies, they will reform and rise again for as long as their magnum opus lives on in the memories of those that have heard it.",
				"But there's a catch. There is a reason why the last performance before turning into an intoner is called a swan song. Once the dead bard rises again as an intoner, they will never be able to perform their magnum opus again. They must rely on the people that have heard their magnum opus to keep it alive. Some intoners ensure their arcane song continues to resonate with new people by becoming beloved composers that inspire new aspiring musicians to learn how to play an intoner's magnum opus, whereas others become tyrants that force others to learn their song so that they may continue to live within the memories of new generations. Which sort of intoner a bard will become, only the bard in question knows."

				"When we think of immortality, many of us think not of flesh, but of steel. Cold, hard, unfeeling metal will outlast all biological matter. To those not concerned with questions about what is natural, there is much  appeal in the eternal artificial.",
				"A Necromaton is an anomaly even among liches, as they are completely and utterly defined by their phylactery. An artificer who turns to lichdom has an arduous task ahead of them: they must make a construct that will house their soul. The process to create these is complex, lengthy, and costly. As a general rule, artificers never settle for anything basic, and knowing that the construct will house their soul can often drive an artificer to add more and more features and capabilities to that automaton, but the requirements for a construct to act as a phylactery for the lich artificer are deceptively simple.",
				"The first one is that the artificer must make the construct themselves. It's unknown exactly how much of the process can be left to automation, but the artificer must have a hand in the constructs make.",
				"The second one is darker. For a construct to act as a phylactery, it needs a biological component. This is called a soul anchor, and it's often one of the artificer's own organs, although bones have been known to work. As much as some artificers wish to rid themselves of the weakness of their flesh, they cannot deny that for their souls to be grafted onto their automaton phylacteries, there needs to be a biological component for the soul to attach itself to.",
				"Once the creation of one of these automatons is completed successfully, it is referred to as a necromaton -- and so is the artificer lich, as they are one and the same. Once the artificer embraces death to turn to lichdom, their soul possesses the constructed phylactery, gaining access to all its features and capabilities. A necromaton's phylactery is their own mechanical body.",
				"Necromatons understand that replacing their flesh body with one of steel is not enough. It might be harder to destroy a necromaton housing the artificer's soul, but it isn't impossible. A necromaton will then create new iterations of itself, more bodies to house their soul in case the one they currently occupy is destroyed, or in case they need different capabilities. A necromaton can do anything they want to do, as long as the artificer can create a body able to do those things. The soul becomes the software that runs through the hardware of the constructed body. Like a spirit possessing a person, the necromaton possesses their own phylacteries at will.",
				"Necromatons are known to create entire armies of automaton phylacteries. These constructs are able to move and act on their own, but they can also be possessed by the necromaton's soul at any time. These necromantic armies of constructs act as a powerful, unrelenting force against the necromaton's enemies, but they also act as insurance, since any of the constructs can house the necromaton's soul if the one they currently inhabit is destroyed.",
				"But, like for any lich, eternal undeath is an ongoing struggle for the necromaton. The soul anchors inside the necromaton's bodies decay with time, as do the shells themselves. Even steel decays, metals lose their shine, and even if iron is harder than flesh, it can still rust. Necromatons find themselves needing to create and replace their phylacteries regularly, and there's only so much their old flesh bodies can offer them for soul anchors. Either because of the sheer number of phylacteries a necromaton builds, or because they must replace their bodies with new ones as time goes by, the necromaton must eventually turn to a different source of soul anchors. A living source, a new raw material to use in their construction of new necromatons: and so, the necromaton bends metal and meat, bones and bolts, to create new bodies out of the pieces of their victims in a race to stave off death itself."

Willingly giving into anger in such a way that it replaces all other feelings, dulling them until nothing but anger can be felt anymore, is the first and most important step in becoming a Scourge.",
				"Of all methods to reach lichdom, the process to become a Scourge is the least complex, but it's also the one where the resulting lich least resembles who they were before embracing unlife. The first step in this path towards lichdom is to experience a blinding, searing rage for as long as possible. Those who wish to become a Scourge train their anger like a skill, sharpening it like a blade, ensuring that every one of their thoughts is of anger and hate.",
				"While in this state, a Scourge-to-be endeavors to cultivate this rage and hatred not just within themselves, but also within others, as that is the only way that Scourges can create their phylacteries. A Scourge phylactery, often called a vendetta, is any creature that deeply hates the Scourge. A part of the Scourge's soul lives on within the hatred that the vendetta phylacteries feel for the Scourge. For as long as one creature viscerally hates the Scourge, the Scourge will come back to undeath if they are slain.",
				"Once the lich-to-be has completely replaced their own soul with rage, once they have filled the hearts of their vendettas with hate towards the Scourge, and once their body cannot physically take the strain of their own rage anymore, the mortal dies and the undead Scourge awakens and begins their death march.",
				"A Scourge's rage compels them to always march forward, and to destroy anything in their path. Like a one-man horde, they will destroy entire towns that stand in their way, mercilessly mowing through its inhabitants. But they will alway leave survivors to cry for those killed by the walking Scourge, for those left behind are almost guaranteed to become new vendettas for the Scourge. These vendettas ensure the Scourge's ongoing existence as they continue their death march, like a stain upon the land contained to just one undying being.",
				"If the Scourge is slain, they will come back like their lich brethren, but through a different process. The Scourge doesn't materialize next to a phylactery like other liches; their method of continued unlife is far more insidious. When a vendetta is created, a piece of the lich's soul lives within the anger that the vendetta feels for the Scourge. Upon a Scourge's death, that part of the lich's soul grows in power, along with the anger that the vendetta feels, until that anger transforms into searing hatred, and then blinding rage -- until it consumes the vendetta's soul and leaves the body as an empty vessel for the Scourge's soul to take over, granting the lich a new undead carcass with which to carry on their unending death march."

				"Out of every ritual to become a lich, the one reserved for the soul incarnate is the hardest.",
				"It all starts with meditation, years of it, enough so the monk has perfect and total control of their ki, then, the ritual can start. The monk must find and cultivate a plant. The specific plant varies by monastic tradition, but its broad effects remain the same. When consumed as tea, the brew dries the body from within, slowly purging it from all liquid. Once the monk finds this plant and procures themselves with a steady supply of it, the monk will then limit their ingestion of solid foods until all they consume is the tea.",
				"It's at this stage of the ritual that the monk's control of ki will play a key role in whether the monk survives the ritual or doesn't.",
				"The monk will find a place. A heavily fortified monastery, a secluded mountain, the center of an impregnable labyrinth, whatever they decide is the best location to lay their body, but not themselves, to rest.",
				"Traditionally, other monks will accompany the soul incarnate to assist them but most importantly to bear witness to a potentially successful ritual. Though the methods vary, the tradition stipulates that the monk will bury themselves down a shaft that has been excavated 6 feet or more underground in a wooden box just tall enough to accommodate them kneeling, and there, the monk will wait with one final cup of tea. This will be the last meal the monk will ever take, regardless of the outcome of the ritual.",
				"Most hopeful soul incarnate will die at this point, for what they are about to attempt has only been successfully performed a number of times in the single digits throughout recorded history.",
				"The monk must find a way to sustain themselves through ki alone. They must turn their body and their mind into a perpetual motion machine, a perfect circuit that requires no energy source from the outside world to continue operating. The truest form of the concept of transcendence: complete transcendence from sustenance, from nourishment, from life and death.",
				"Once a day, the other monks will use a bell tied to a string that goes all the way down into the monk's box to check on the monk. If the bell rings, the monk is still alive. Once the bell rings no more, the retinue of monks will wait a month, long enough for the body of a dead monk to decompose, and finally unearth the box. In the impossibly rare event that the monk not only died, but managed to find a way to achieve undeath, the creature that will rise out of the box is no longer a monk, but a soul incarnate. Except, it won't be its body that rises, but its ki alone.",
				"The drying effect of the tea had a second goal, a mummifying one. A successful soul incarnate has managed to suspend their own body in a state of perfect stasis, and turn it into a phylactery, which it will hide and protect in their chosen location while their ki is free to roam the earth.",
				"A soul incarnate is the only lich that manifests and acts upon the world as an ethereal undead, rather than a corporeal one. They manifest in a form that reflects the one they had in life, and not like the desiccated corpse that most other liches resemble, except this form is not physical. The soul incarnate is at all times perfectly between the ethereal and the material, as signified by its gaseous, unearthly appearance. It's \"body\" is literally made of Ki, as signified by the glowing meridians that are visible through its form. In it's Ki form it is weaker than other liches, but if someone finds its phylactery and tries to destroy it, the Ki form will possess its former body, revealing the true strength of the soul incarnate to those that dare try to end its unlife. One might think that it's the soul incarnate's appearance that truly distinguishes it from other liches, but this is not the true difference between these undead and the rest. The soul incarnate, unlike its brethren, doesn't need any form of sustenance.",
				"The ritual to become a soul incarnate is, without a doubt, the hardest and most dangerous one, but the rewards match the difficulty of the execution of the ritual. A soul incarnate has achieved total transcendence, and therefore does not need the souls of others to continue its undeath, its phylactery is a perpetual machine, and its control of ki is so great that it allows the lich to forgo the need for sustenance. It could theoretically live forever if it so chooses. Some soul incarnates act as undying leaders of millenia-old monasteries, preserving the monastic traditions and passing on their knowledge to new initiates, and famous examples of good natured or at least non violent soul incarnates do exist, but there are just as many examples of soul incarnates that completely lose the inherent connection that binds all mortal beings, more than any other lich since their particular undeath allows them to never interact with the living. Other liches must interact with the living, even if it is to kill them, soul incarnates can turn hermit, ignoring them forever. These soul incarnates turn into a completely different type of monster, one with the wisdom granted by millenia of meditation and the callous power given by a complete disregard or even contempt for the lives of the living. Much like one doesn't concern themselves with the wants and needs of the ants they step on, the soul incarnate doesn't concern itself with the hopes of the living. The most terrifying aspect of soul incarnate is how many of them were caring and wise for centuries before becoming jaded and monstrously inhuman as they kept on existing through the ages."
