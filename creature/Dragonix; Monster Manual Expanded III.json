										"A humanoid creature can be afflicted by the aswang curse after it willingly made or was tricked into making a dark pact with a Demon Lord, sometimes through the actions of a hag. One can also be born into it if one or both of its parents are aswangs. Casting {@spell remove curse}, {@spell greater restoration}, or similar spell can free a humanoid of the curse, but a natural born aswang can only be freed of the curse with a {@spell wish}. An aswang can either resist its curse or welcome it. By fighting the curse, an aswang keeps its normal behavior and personality while in its natural form. It can try to live its life as it wants but must constantly stave off the urge to feed. However, at nights of the full moon, the hunger becomes too great, and the curse overcomes the individual, forcing it to transform into its fiendish form. An aswang driven to this state becomes ravenous and will not stop hunting until it has fed. Each night that it fails to feed in its fiend form, it gains 1 level of {@condition exhaustion}.",
										"A genuinely depraved individual, or someone corrupted by it, sees the aswang curse as a gift and, over time, masters the ability to change into a fiend. However, an aswang can only transform at night and retain its demonic form until dawn, at which point it automatically transforms back to its humanoid form."

										"Aswangs hide in plain sight, living amongst normal folk and often taking up occupations like butchers, hunters, gravediggers, taxidermists, and trappers to help divert suspicions of why their homes may sometimes smell of carrion and death. They insert themselves into humanoid communities and earn their neighbors' trust through charm, friendliness, and generosity. They avoid getting physically close to an individual, though, because if one looks directly at their eyes, they will discover that their reflection is upside down. Aswangs tend to prey on members of society that no one will miss if they suddenly disappear. If such targets are unavailable, they travel to another community, settlement, or location that is far from their homes. They won't risk feeding near where they live. Anyone who becomes suspicious of them, or sees them in their fiendish form, is always dealt with immediately for fear of rousing an organized mob. A successful clan of aswangs can live in the outskirts of town, preying on its citizens for years without getting caught. If things start to go awry, the aswangs will not risk staying. They will leave as soon as they can and establish themselves in another community to begin anew."

Typically during the day, aswangs pick and mark their target and identify where they live. At night after they transform, they stalk their prey and bide their time until they can attack when their target is most vulnerable. This means most of their assaults happen when their target is alone or asleep. They often just leave the bodies of their victims where they are to avoid the risk of getting caught. Because their kills bear specific types of wounds commonly attributed to ghouls, lycanthropes, or vampires, they aren't worried suspicions about their presence will be brought up."

While an aswang can resist most blows, weapons made from a stingray's barbed tail, even simple ones, can hurt them normally. Because they become fiends while transformed, they are susceptible to attacks that specifically harm fiends, such as holy water. If an aswang fails its saving throw against a {@spell Dispel Evil and Good} spell, it reverts to its humanoid form and can't transform for 1 minute."

The brown dragon has four short, muscular limbs that end with webbed claws suitable for digging through the sand and a pair of leathery wing vestiges at the back of its shoulders.

In its fiend form, the tiktik resembles a feral humanoid with dark leathery skin covered with a shallow layerof brown fur. A hard mask-like shell plating protects its face, and a row of bony protrusions line its spine. Like a vampire bat, the tiktik's wings are actually its fingers, with the membrane between the finger bones making up the wing. Its fingers and feet end in long, black talons. Its most distinct feature is its 10-foot long, tubular tongue that ends in a proboscis-like tip. Just like the {@creature manananggal|MonsterManualExpanded3}, its tongue secretes anesthetic saliva that numbs the pain, allowing the tiktik to drain its victim at leisure.",

Pregnant women give off a distinct odor which the tiktik can pick up even from miles away with its keen sense of smell. Upon reaching the home of its intended target, the tiktik will usually land on the victim's roof or wall beside a window adjacent to its prey. With the target's strong scent driving it ravenous, the tiktik begins to drool. It first checks if its prey is sleeping before it acts. It then starts digging a hole through the roof or window with its talons, creating a soft 'tiktik' sound from which the aswang gets its name. Once it has successfully created an aperture, it sends its snaking tongue inside to puncture the target's womb and suck the unborn fetus through its proboscis. If it can't find its favorite prey, the tiktik will settle for sucking the blood, liver, and heart from young folk and children. Because their tongue drips with anesthetic saliva, a sleeping victim may not notice the attack."

The orcwort can produce up to 60 pods during one period of activity, and once mature, the pods fall to the ground and break open, releasing the wortlings. In combat, the orcwort can defend itself by unleashing roots that entangle and grasp at its enemies. The orcwort then attacks with its tentacles, which it uses to bludgeon and grab prey.

Once a wortling finds suitable prey, such as a humanoid settlement, the orcwort makes all the wortlings converge toward that area. The wortlings, acting like a raiding party, descend on the settlement, incapacitating and capturing as many creatures as possible and carry them back alive to be devoured by the orcwort. The process is repeated until the orcwort has fed enough or it is time for it to hibernate. The orcwort then uproots itself and wanders for days until it finds a suitable spot to hibernate.

The manananggal must attach itself back to its lower body before dawn, or else it will slowly die.

By nightfall, they transform and head toward the home of their marked prey. Once there, they search for an opening into their sleeping target's room, often using open windows, chimneys, and roof egresses to gain access. Manananggals avoid direct combat, but if they are unable to feed via their preferred method, it searches and stalks for other suitable prey, targeting lone victims."

These naga servants were entrusted with eons worth of secret magical research. After their masters died out, these nagas dabbled with dark rituals gleaned from the materials given to them, hoping to gain more power. While most died or were driven insane as a result of the rituals, a few were successfully transformed into ha-nagas. This handful of ha-nagas then divided and led the surviving races and ruled over them, each building new civilizations that lasted for thousands of years until its eventual collapse. As time passed, the ha-nagas dwindled and were largely forgotten. This was deliberate though, as ha-nagas became increasingly paranoid, isolated, and secretive, lurking deep within the ruins of the once-great cities they ruled. As they observed new nations rise and advance to great lengths from afar, they seethed with anger and envy, appalled at the ambitions of these young lesser races that seem to mock and disrespect the ha-naga's legacy."
