All knights\u2014new or veteran\u2014are expected to live up to the demands of their institutions and earn the training and equipment they bear. Thus, every knight is prepared to ride fearlessly into peril and face any foe with bravery."

While some mages can only manage a handful of spells for practical use, others can call upon magic capable of leveling a city."

					"Martial Artists are warriors who train their bodies to be as dangerous as any weapon forged of crude steel. By cultivating the connection between their body and spirit, they tap into an inner source of power. With it, they can perform extraordinary feats of athleticism, make unarmed strikes with incredible speed and strength, and even disrupt the flow of energy in their opponents' bodies. They are nimble and fluid in combat, and many foes have difficulty landing even a single blow against their agile fighting style. Many martial artists train themselves for more than just combat, and follow a dedicated form of spirituality where their combat arts are viewed as one expression of a greater way of life."

					"Necromancers are spellcasters who call on the power of death itself. Their spells weaken muscles, decay flesh, and sap the warmth of the living. Necromancers understand the connection between life and death, and use it to animate undead servants to steal vitality from their victims. This power over death is typically seen as sinister or taboo, and necromancers evoke dread where their presence is discovered. Only the bravest souls confront necromancers, knowing what awaits them if they fail: the end of their life, and the beginning of their servitude."

Thugs may not fight fancy, but they get the job done."
