They are as likely to be encountered as allies as they are to be enemies, and many heroes seek them out for aid. Priests of Light focus more on bolstering their allies than bringing ruin to their enemies, and they can keep those allies fighting long after others would have fallen."

					"Templars are bound by oath to champion a spiritual ideal. Their devotion to this ideal empowers them: A templar can cast spells, and their attacks are strengthened by divine power. Some templars dedicate themselves to religious convictions, such as service to a god or church, but many templars commit themselves to an abstract idea, such as “justice,” “vengeance,” or “peace.” The very presence of a templar bolsters allies, and if those allies fall, the templar can heal their injuries and ailments with a touch. Girded in stout armor and bearing a radiant sword, a templar is a beacon of hope to their friends and a harbinger of retribution to their enemies."
