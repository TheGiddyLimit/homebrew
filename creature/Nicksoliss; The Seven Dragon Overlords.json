					"The ancient city of Imperia was once the greatest metropolis in all the land. With mighty towers that reached the heavens and wealth beyond imagination, there was no mortal realm that could compare to its magnificence.",
					"However, its ruler, eager to extend his kingdom and add to his already massive wealth, started a campaign to expand Imperia. Rallying the people under the banner of unity, the mortals entered an almost unstoppable frenzy, reaching upon all corners of the continent.",
					"Unfortunately, destiny was a cruel mistress: in their eagerness and rush, the kingdom had entered the lands of seven mighty entities, the Dragon Overlords: Athrazor, Lord of Cinder; Coldryum, the Crystal Nightmare; Noxia, Mistress of Venom; Slithrae, Terror of the Depths; Umbrazar, the Undying Shadow; Zhao Leng, Emperor of the Skies and Magnamanus, the Dragon Tyrant.",
					"Creatures of unimaginable strength, not only did they wipe the armies that entered their domains, but proceeded to attack Imperia in punishment for their advance. Desperate, the king's mages executed an emergency plan: gathering arcane energies from across the Multiverse, they summoned back from the dead the spirits of powerful heroes, legends of their respective lands who'd already managed to surpass unbelievable odds. Amused, the Dragon Overlords offered the king a deal: if his Champions could defeat them, they'd leave the kingdom forever. However, if they failed, they would make all mortals their slaves for eternity. The deal was sealed, and the king's Champions faced the mighty dragons in combat.",
					"However, for as powerful and experienced as the Champions were, the Overlords proved too much. Their mangled corpses were thrown upon the throne room, and they claimed the kingdom as theirs. Stealing all riches and wreaking havoc to their leisure, they made a final warning before leaving: at the end of each century, they would come back, eager to steal and destroy as they saw fit. Before leaving, though, they encouraged the mortals to once again try their luck. {@i \"We will face all your champions, mortals, and we will prevail.\"}",
					"Thus, the Hunting Games were born. Each century, the city of Imperia once again becomes a battleground, with the almighty Dragon Overlords returning, ready to face the legends of other lands and proving that no one can compete against the dreadful power.",

					"Originating from the Ashen Volcano at the north of Imperia, the Lord of Cinder Athrazor is the youngest and most vicious of all the DragonOverlords. Eager to prove himself in battle against anyone, it was him who caused the most havoc in the first attack of the Overlords against the city of Imperia.",
					"Violent and short tempered, Athrazor enjoys the danger of battle more than any of his brethren, launching himself towards his prey and striking with speed and rage, wounding his enemies and overpowering them with his fiery breath.Though no mortal has yet proven to be his match in the fray of combat, those few who have pushed him far enough have seen his wrath explode, increasing his speed and savagery even further.",
					"His hot temper, however, has brought him conflict with the other Overlords, whom, with the exception of Magnamanus the Tyrant, he sees as inferior to him. His hatred towards some of the Overlords, like the Emperor of the Skies ZhaoLeng with whom he constantly fights for dominion over the skies, and his despise towards the Undying ShadowUmbrazar, whom he considers a coward reliant on cheap tricks, is well known by the other dragons.",
					"Despite his young age though, Athrazor is one of the strongest Dragon Overlords, keeping pace with the Emperor of the Skies and shadowed only by the might of the DragonTyrant. Volcanoes erupting under his mere presence, his power has made the rest of the Overlords constantly keep an eye on his actions, his unpredictability and impulsiveness always a factor to consider. Constantly flying through the city in search of violence, no one enjoys the Hunting Game more that the Lord of Cinder, Athrazor."

					"Unfortunately, destiny was a cruel mistress: in their eagerness and rush, the kingdom had entered the lands of seven mighty entities, the Dragon Overlords: Athrazor, Lord of Cinder; Coldryum, the Crystal Nightmare; Noxia, Mistress of Venom; Slithrae, Terror of the Depths; Umbrazar, the Undying Shadow; Zhao Leng, Emperor of the Skies and Magnamanus, the Dragon Tyrant.",
					"Creatures of unimaginable strength, not only did they wipe the armies that entered their domains, but proceeded to attack Imperia in punishment for their advance. Desperate, the king's mages executed an emergency plan: gathering arcane energies from across the Multiverse, they summoned back from the dead the spirits of powerful heroes, legends of their respective lands who'd already managed to surpass unbelievable odds. Amused, the Dragon Overlords offered the king a deal: if his Champions could defeat them, they'd leave the kingdom forever. However, if they failed, they would make all mortals their slaves for eternity. The deal was sealed, and the king's Champions faced the mighty dragons in combat.",
					"However, for as powerful and experienced as the Champions were, the Overlords proved too much. Their mangled corpses were thrown upon the throne room, and they claimed the kingdom as theirs. Stealing all riches and wreaking havoc to their leisure, they made a final warning before leaving: at the end of each century, they would come back, eager to steal and destroy as they saw fit. Before leaving, though, they encouraged the mortals to once again try their luck. {@i \"We will face all your champions, mortals, and we will prevail.\"}",
					"Thus, the Hunting Games were born. Each century, the city of Imperia once again becomes a battleground, with the almighty Dragon Overlords returning, ready to face the legends of other lands and proving that no one can compete against the dreadful power.",

					"However, beneath his calmly presence hides great ambition. The most greedy Overlord, Coldryum exploited the chaos provoked by the attack to steal all he could find in the ruins of the crumbling city. With mountains of gold and piles of magical items in his claws, the Crystal Nightmare knew that the Hunting Games would be the perfect opportunity to increase his riches. It was him who convinced the otherDragon Overlords that the Hunting Games should be repeated every 100 years, giving the Imperians enough time to recover, to once again gather treasure for his grasp.",
					"When it comes to dealing with the rest of the Overlords,however, Coldryum usually opts for a low profile approach.While sharing his amusement with the champions with theUndying Shadow, Umbrazar, with whom he has an uneasy alliance, the Crystal Nightmare avoids treating with the rest of the Overlords, especially when it comes to the Terror of the Depths Slithrae and Athrazor, Lord of Cinder, whom he considers nothing more than savages.",
					"Thus, while most of the Overlords enjoy themselves wreaking havoc throughout the city and battling against the champions of other planes, Coldryum employs his time assaulting any structure that may contain loot worth taking.However, when battle comes to him, none can withstand his power over ice and cold. Knowing that any adventurers brought to Imperia would surely bring with them relics of other lands, the Crystal Nightmare eagerly awaits any opportunity to face the mortal champions in combat and claim their possessions for himself."

Desperate, the king's mages executed an emergency plan: gathering arcane energies from across the Multiverse, they summoned back from the dead the spirits of powerful heroes, legends of their respective lands who'd already managed to surpass unbelievable odds. Amused, the Dragon Overlords offered the king a deal: if his Champions could defeat them, they'd leave the kingdom forever. However, if they failed, they would make all mortals their slaves for eternity. The deal was sealed, and the king's Champions faced the mighty dragons in combat.",
					"However, for as powerful and experienced as the Champions were, the Overlords proved too much. Their mangled corpses were thrown upon the throne room, and they claimed the kingdom as theirs. Stealing all riches and wreaking havoc to their leisure, they made a final warning before leaving: at the end of each century, they would come back, eager to steal and destroy as they saw fit. Before leaving, though, they encouraged the mortals to once again try their luck. {@i \"We will face all your champions, mortals, and we will prevail.\"}",
					"Thus, the Hunting Games were born. Each century, the city of Imperia once again becomes a battleground, with the almighty Dragon Overlords returning, ready to face the legends of other lands and proving that no one can compete against the dreadful power.",

If the mortals were so eager to suffer under her venomous whim, then she would gladly take such gift to their beloved city.",
					"Thousands fell under her poisonous breath, their skin peeling off their bodies and their lungs rotting in the presence of her venom, and all weapons and protections proved meaningless under her acidic claws, corroding everything in her way into oblivion. She wasn't interested in the meaningless treasures of the mortals like Coldryum, nordid she share Umbrazar or Zhao Leng's fascination with them; for her, mortals were only useful as long as they were suffering, serving as her entertainment.",
					"Thus, when the Hunting Game was proclaimed byMagnamanus, Noxia was most joyful. Now, every century, she would have the opportunity to not only see the pain of the weak retching under her poison, but to have the most powerful and brave heroes of other lands experience what true suffering is. Nothing brought her more satisfaction than the idea of having those brave champions, who'd already faced the dangers of their planes, fall under the power of her venom.",
					"Now, the Mistress of Venom eagerly awaits every iteration of the Game, expectant to play with her victims. Slowly debilitating them through the stay in Imperia, having them watch as those they try to protect die under hes dreadful poison, Noxia enjoys nothing more that the slow spectacle of watching her prey slowly wither away and perish."

Desperate, the king's mages executed an emergency plan: gathering arcane energies from across the Multiverse, they summoned back from the dead the spirits of powerful heroes, legends of their respective lands who'd already managed to surpass unbelievable odds. Amused, the Dragon Overlords offered the king a deal: if his Champions could defeat them, they'd leave the kingdom forever. However, if they failed, they would make all mortals their slaves for eternity. The deal was sealed, and the king's Champions faced the mighty dragons in combat.",

Stealing all riches and wreaking havoc to their leisure, they made a final warning before leaving: at the end of each century, they would come back, eager to steal and destroy as they saw fit. Before leaving, though, they encouraged the mortals to once again try their luck. {@i \"We will face all your champions, mortals, and we will prevail.\"}",

However, when the Tyrant's roar announced the incoming assault, Umbrazar knew he'd found a marvelous chance.",
					"Using such opportunity to study the mortals and their magic, Umbrazar was astounded when the Imperians pulled such a mighty feat of bringing Champions of other lands to face them. If the mortals possessed the secrets of planar travel, the Undying Shadow would find a way to master it.",
					"Now, every Hunting Game is a chance to further his knowledge and finally escape the bounds of this plane. His alliance with the Crystal Nightmare would serve him well, for the other Overlords' distrust of his schemes could prove an inconvenience and an ally was most helpful. Until the moment is ripe, Umbrazar will continue attending the Game,learning, experimenting, readying himself for the moment when he bring expand his dominion over magic and death to all corners of the Multiverse."
