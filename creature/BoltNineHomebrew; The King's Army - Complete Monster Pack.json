Each blue elf is separated because the magic of others seem to be attracted to him. A spell cast in his vicinity will be redirected towards the elf and spit back at the unintentional assailant. At first, a blue elf has no control over this, but through years of study and training, learns to control this mysterious and powerful ability.",
