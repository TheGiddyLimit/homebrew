					"Blue elves are peculiar creatures.",
					"Many elves show a natural disposition to magic at an early age; blue elves, however, display this proficiency differently. As these elves reach their teenage years, their skin develops a light blue sheen, a glow which distinguishes them from their peers and all others. Around the same age, they begin showing an aptitude in magic, a few years after other elves.",
					"Primitive Casting.",
					"Once a blue elf's magical aptitude is revealed, they immediately begin training at the Magic Academy. However, though they go through the same rigorous training all initiates go through, the blue elves never show an aptitude with offensive spells, excelling instead at domination and manipulative spells.",
					"Magnetic Aura.",
					"Blue elves are trained separately from other initiates. This is not meant to segregate them for their skin color or primitive casting. Each blue elf is separated because the magic of others seem to be attracted to him. A spell cast in his vicinity will be redirected towards the elf and spit back at the unintentional assailant. At first, a blue elf has no control over this, but through years of study and training, learns to control this mysterious and powerful ability.",
					"Magical Lightning Rod.",
					"The King and his military advisors saw the power of the blue elves and knew that their power can be used to protect the large army under the King's control. Blue elves are used as a magical deterrent, their control of domination and manipulation spells make them the most effective tools at killing enemy magic users."
