The following examples are drawn from the Midgard setting (though applicable elsewhere).",

The demons have been known to live in the belltowers of her cathedrals, creating nests of bone similar (at a distance) to stork nests. Being demons, the nests never contain eggs but are supplied with rounded, egglike skulls in profusion. On some occasions, a pair of neophron demons might carry a priestess swiftly through the sky from one place to another for some unholy purpose.",

This is a notable amount of flesh and blood, but the power of the neophron to scout in darkness grants the upper hand to those who employ them in raiding, surprise attacks, and even the wholesale clash of armies. The ritual is known as an evil one, and the nomads avoid the summoning when they can. Those leaders who employ it are always somewhat suspect.",
									"{@b In the Ghoul Empire.} Surprisingly, neophron demons thrive underground among the ghouls, where they often serve as bodyguards for darakhul nobles, evil high priests, and other notables. Their darkvision makes it possible for them to fly along underground passages with tremendous speed, tracking and often overtaking small bands of derro raiders, kobold merchants, or other underworld travelers.",
									"{@b In Desert Oases.} Neophron work with {@creature Gypsosphinx|ToB|gypsosphinxes} ({@loader Tome of Beasts|creature/Kobold Press; Tome of Beasts.json}) in desert territories, acting as scouts and spies for the creatures. They operate as guardians of temples and religious sites of Set and Anu Akma, the god of the underworld.

Belphegor and his minions sealed the chasms at day's end, and thusly were the bodily wastes of Hell returned to its unhallowed ground. Though he did as was commanded by the Lords of Hell, the stooped and wretched devil desired power and rank. He began to conceive of ways to reduce the labor of his task. He built a great contraption from the bones of the damned to perform his toilsome task in his stead and named it Prime.

When he arrived to rend the delinquent devil into pieces as punishment for abandoning the task, the Arch-Devil saw Belphegor's machine and smiled wickedly. Through the busywork of self-indulgent invention, Belphegor had managed to produce nothing on a never-before seen scale. Belphegor was immediately made a lieutenant and given domain over tempting brilliant mortals into fruitless ingenuity and invention.

											"Hundreds of years ago, the Archmage of Vael Turog escaped the destruction his nation suffered in the Mage Wars and made his way far to the east, where he found a mountain at the site of the conjunction of two powerful ley lines. Located on the southern border of the tsar of Vidim's lands, this mountain was filled with dark and demonic energies and had been considered a blight on the map in the tsar's estimation. The archmage was offered dominion over the mountain if he could tame it and end the threats that issued from it. He summoned and bound a demonic legion, brought the mountain under his control, and staked his claim. The tsar, unaware and uninterested in the details, was delighted, and the archmage became known as the Master of Demon Mountain.",
											"He raised a castle there overnight, called Castle Dontrona, and there he has ruled for so long that the people of the surrounding plains have largely forgotten his name. Out of fear or dread of drawing his attention, they refer to him as \"the Master\" when occasion demands they speak of him at all.",
											"Since coming to the mountain, the Master's spells and incantations carry greater potency. The demons praise him, and he has mated with more than a few. The pacts the Master swore to gain power over the mountain and its creatures, however, are not the endless font of power that he had hoped. Indeed, he rarely leaves the mountain, and his children suspect he does not truly command it. Instead, the mountain commands him to bring it reagents and perform certain rituals, as demanded by demonic messengers, dreams, or priests of Chernobog.",
											"His lust for power drives him to ally with the Bemmeans, to offer arcana to the Dragon Empire, and to seek the hand of the tsar's comely daughters. His depravity simmers beneath an affected veneer of civility. In distant courts, the Master is known by the name he used in Vael Turog: Roggero Lucar Ordontrona, or sometimes an even older name, Gardever the Archmage of Vael Turog. He claims to be the last living scion of the noble bloodline of Vael Turog. Whether true or an empty boast, he acts the part and then some."

One man noticed that it was a ningyo and, not wishing to offend his host, told his friends to secretly dispose of their meal. One man, drunk on sake, forgot that he put his ningyo sashimi in his pocket and gave it to his adult daughter when he returned home. The daughter ate it and lived with eternal youth, marrying many lovers and watching them die while she remained young. After 800 years, she returned to her hometown and took her own life."

The glories of combat do not blind them to their duties under the laws of war. War chaplains are also necessarily well-versed in a broad range of funeral rites and practices, for their faithful soldiers often follow more than one tradition."
