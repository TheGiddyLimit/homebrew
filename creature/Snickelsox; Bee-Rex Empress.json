			"A fusion of bee resilience and tyrannosaurus strength; these creatures create massive, miles-long hives and can take down whole kingdoms if given the chance. Created as an attempt to imbue bees with greater resilience, the experiments quickly took over, backfiring in the worst way possible. They quickly spread out from captivity, began breeding, and are now simply part of the world.",
			"Beehave. Thanks to millions of years of perfectly refining bee society, the Bee-Rex creations were able to very quickly establish a collective hierarchy. Unlike regular bees, the queen, called the Bee-Rex Empress, directly reigns over the rest of the hive, sometimes by force. Bee- Rex are exceedingly short tempered, resulting in frequent conflict in the hive. If enough negative energy builds up in a hive, the Bee-Rex may turn on the empress, overwhelming them and making blood honey from their carcass.",
			"Blood Honey. It is unlikely a single Bee-Rex could be sustained by the nectar from a flower field, much less an entire hive. To this end, Bee-Rex have adapted their carnivorous appetite to make a horrifying type of honey. Referred to as Blood Honey, it's deep red, tastes vaguely of iron and is made when a Bee-Rex eats a living creature. A special digestive system dissolves the creature entirely, mixing with saliva-like substances, then the Bee-Rex is able to regurgitate Blood Honey. A hive can create gallons daily, if given enough raw material to process. Though disgusting in origin, it has great healing properties and is highly sought after by necromancers for the energy wrapped in it."
