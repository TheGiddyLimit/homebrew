However, the teachings of obedience and humbleness before the goddess of beauty and love appealed to Valerie no more than the adoring pursuit of unwanted courters. For many years, she struggled with this against her desire to respect her father, and so she leaned into the martial aspect of her training. Yet one cannot force devotion, and it was only a matter of time before Valerie's patience expired and, in a fit of frustration, she railed against the traditions of Shelyn's teaching, denouncing the concept that beauty and art could ever serve as anything more than hollow praise and delusions of fulfillment."

								"During the course of updating the {@i Kingmaker Adventure Path} from its original six-volume run over a decade ago, we've done much more than simply translate rules and rebuild stat blocks. Taking inspiration from the {@i Pathfinder: Kingmaker} video game created by Owlcat Games, suggestions and observations from over 10 years of feedback, and our own desires to build upon the framework presented the first time around, we have expanded the scope of the {@i Kingmaker Adventure Path} dramatically. Most significantly, we've redesigned the adventure to offer more than enough sandbox play for the PCs to be able to advance all the way to 20th level by the campaign's end\u2014indeed, some parties who focus on completing every possible encounter might find themselves hitting 20th level well before the campaign reaches its final chapter!",

Though the rules for building kingdoms and running warfare encounters presented in the {@i Kingmaker Adventure Path} use Pathfinder Second Edition as their foundation, every effort has been made to make those rules as self-contained as possible. Since playing out Kingdom turns and warfare encounters occurs largely outside the scope of the adventure's primary plot, you can use these self-contained rules as add-ons to any 5E game\u2014or any game that uses another rules system. Of course, as mentioned above, developing familiarity with Pathfinder Second Edition rules and mechanics can help you to run kingdom-building content and warfare encounters. If you prefer to avoid that, keep in mind that the {@i Kingmaker Adventure Path} still works if the kingdom develops in the background through narrative play. See the various chapters in the Adventure Path for advice on how to run kingdom development in this manner."

As you run your game, you may find that these challenge ratings might feel too high or too low, and you should examine each encounter with an eye toward how it might play for your specific group before introducing it. You can adjust a creature's challenge rating manually if you wish, but often it'll be easier to reduce the total number of creatures in order to provide a more appropriate encounter for your group.",

As your players defeat foes and search for loot, don't hesitate to adjust the amount or type of treasure handed out in encounters to help keep your PCs appropriately geared-up for the fights to come. It's a good idea to generate replacement treasures ahead of time so that when your players defeat the monsters, they won't have to wait for you to pick and choose their prizes!"

Often crude, always hot-tempered, and continually full of impulsive bravado, she is perfectly aware of how strong and tough she is. As a result, Amiri stands ready to prove her bravery and might. No one would be faulted for thinking the boastful, brawny, and bull-headed barbarian fears nothing\u2014she hides her insecurities about her past and her fear of not being allowed to belong deftly. Her confidence in her own capabilities can be, at times, misplaced or overestimated, but Amiri is not foolhardy. Faced with a situation where she has to admit that brute force won't prevail, her typical response is to seek other methods of success while continuing to hone her skills and increase her power. If such an alternative plan doesn't work, at least she has a good excuse to rely on what she knows best: brute force. Amiri values her oversized sword, and isn't easily persuaded to wield another weapon, although she will do so begrudgingly if tactics demand it.",

While she could sense that the city's artisans were struggling to produce actual works of art, the overwhelming regime of suppression and meddling put in place by {@creature Castruccio Irovetti|PKB|King Irovetti} made that difficult at best. As a result, Linzi's time in Pitax fostered more a sense of resistance and rebellion within her than actual inspiration for her stories. Inevitably, these themes crept into her artwork, and when a raunchy limerick she wrote about {@creature Castruccio Irovetti|PKB|King Irovetti} became unexpectedly popular, she was expelled for \"impudence toward persons of the highest esteem.\"",

She felt she'd learned all she could from artisans in Pitax and headed east with a new goal: to find a notable hero or heroes who could serve as her muse, as inspiration for what she felt would be her masterpiece: a gripping tale of adventuring triumph in the face of starkest evil. Her journeys eventually took her into the hinterlands of Brevoy, where she caught wind of Lady {@creature Jamandi Aldori|PKB|Jamandi Aldori's} call for heroes.

For many years, she struggled with this against her desire to respect her father, and so she leaned into the martial aspect of her training.
