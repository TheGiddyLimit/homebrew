								"During my formative gaming years in the 1980s, I occasionally ran tabletop roleplaying games for my friends. Early on, that was mostly D&D, just like you'd expect. But our group branched out into other systems as they came to our attention through the pages of Dragon magazine. One of those was Gamma World, a game about adventuring in a vastly changed new world following a nuclear holocaust. I was keen to run it and bring my group of friends into an alternate dimension of mutants and radioactive threats the likes of which they'd never seen before.",
								"So one afternoon we sat down and rolled up characters. Someone had scored a secondary source of new abilities from a different publisher. I don't recall where it came from, but the players were eager to fuse those additional interesting quirks into their characters, and I was all for it. Getting everything squared away during character creation took well over an hour, maybe two.",
								"But finally, it was time to play! I had a short location ready for the PCs to explore: a gargantuan land ark constructed generations earlier, partly buried, filled with moldering super\u2011science remnants and horrible monsters. And in the very first compartment the PCs opened, they encountered gamma moths.",
								"According to my recollection, gamma moths were radioactive. The monster entry asked that I roll on a radiation reaction chart to see what weird thing would happen to the PCs. I rolled, and in my shock at the result, I blurted it out loud before I could think twice about the repercussions: \"You're all dead!\"",
								"Which I knew, even as I said it, was a terrible, no\u2011good way for the game to go. Chalk it up to a learning experience we all benefited from. Sometimes, you gotta let the dice inform your decisions as the GM, not dictate them. I mean, sure, a total party kill might eventually be in the cards; I've got a reputation to consider. But not during the first encounter.",
								"Learn from my mistake. When you take your game someplace strange, like a perilous new world of the Material Plane or some other place in the multiverse, pay attention to what the monsters encountered there\u2014and let's face it, there will be monsters\u2014can actually do if they're new to you.",
								"Guess what? Planar Bestiary is a trove of monsters gathered from across the planes of existence. All of them have an odd quirk, an unexpected backstory related to crossplanar travel or a dimensional anomaly, or possibly a deadly ability designed to test foes to the limit and beyond. New fiends and celestials, weird aberrations and monstrosities, and strange new humanoids (including some that hail from worlds of high technology) can be found within these pages.",
								"However, here's my solemn promise to you: breathe easy\u2014no gamma moths wait in ambush here."
