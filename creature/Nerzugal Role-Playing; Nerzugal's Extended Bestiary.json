In her stasis she could feel the pain of the disease the entire time. . . he had trapped her in an inescapable prison of agony for years and her sane mind had long since faded. He would never seem to forgive himself for this and decided that he would increase his own life and continue to live on with this guilt until he has finally made peace with himself.
