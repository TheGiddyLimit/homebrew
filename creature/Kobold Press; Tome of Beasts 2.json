Once created, an august rooster can reproduce with any species of bird, which usually results in an exotic-looking example of the bird.

The constant turmoil of its internal struggle leaves the chimeric phantom a chaotic mess of faces, voices, and body language that shift as its emotions change and as minor personalities take hold for seconds at a time. Its struggle is never-ending, permanently damaging the psyches of all the souls that make up the chimeric phantom.

Each creature that starts its turn within 30 feet of the dryad must succeed on a {@dc 16} Charisma saving throw or be {@condition charmed} for 1 minute. A {@condition charmed} creature is {@condition incapacitated} and, if it is more than 5 feet away from the mountain dryad, it must move on its turn toward the dryad by the most direct route, trying to get within 5 feet. It doesn't avoid {@action opportunity attack|phb|opportunity attacks}, but before moving into damaging terrain, such as lava or a pit, and whenever it takes damage from a source other than the dryad, it can repeat the saving throw. While {@condition charmed} within 5 feet of the dryad, a Medium or smaller creature must climb the dryad, no check required. After climbing 20 feet, the {@condition charmed} creature throws itself off the mountain dryad, taking falling damage and landing {@condition prone} in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the mountain dryad. A {@condition charmed} creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success."
