									"Carrier mosquitos are massive insects that defy logic, as they not only stay aloft but also zip around with incredible speed and maneuverability. Their nine-foot wingspans keep them from falling out of the sky, but their wings beat frequently, producing an incredibly loud and distracting drone. Swamp-dwelling {@creature cueyatl|ccodex} ({@loader Creature Codex|collection/Kobold Press; Creature Codex.json}) train carrier mosquitos and use them as mounts. When not using the mosquitos on a hunt, cueyatl riders compete in jousting matches, most of which end with a cueyatl yielding before its mosquito becomes seriously injured to avoid jeopardizing future hunts."

The hands float within 30 feet of the snake and move with their serpent commander. The snake can decide if the hands are visible. Each hand can carry an object weighing up to 10 pounds and no more than three hands can work in tandem to carry one larger object. The snake's Dexterity ({@skill Sleight of Hand}) checks have a range of 30 feet. Whenever the snake makes a Dexterity ({@skill Sleight of Hand}) check, it can make up to four such checks as part of the same action, but each check must be against a different target. The snake can perform actions normally restricted to creatures with hands, such as opening a door, stirring a bowl of soup, or carrying a lantern. The hands can't wield weapons or shields or make attacks, except as part of the snake's Flying Fists action."
