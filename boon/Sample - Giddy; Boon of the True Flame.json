						"When this creature dies, its body turns to faintly-smoldering black ash. Over the next week, provided the ash is not intentionally scattered (it magically resists natural weather effects), it reforms into a hollow husk reminiscent of the creature's living body. Once this process completes, the creature returns to life in its new form, and its type becomes undead if it was not already. In addition, the creature gains immunity to fire damage."
