Over the next week, provided the ash is not intentionally scattered (it magically resists natural weather effects), it reforms into a hollow husk reminiscent of the creature's living body. Once this process completes, the creature returns to life in its new form, and its type becomes undead if it was not already. In addition, the creature gains immunity to fire damage."

The creature must make a Constitution saving throw (the DC for which is based on this creature's Intelligence score). Constructs and undead aren't affected, and plants and water elementals make this saving throw with disadvantage. A creature takes {@damage 4d8} necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one."
