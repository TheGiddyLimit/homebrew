Should a second month pass without meeting the higher 1000gp quota, the rogue fnds an additional 2000gp worth of their valuables and equipment turns to putrid excrement and their hit point maximum has been reduced by 40%. If the character meets their quota for at least one month, the ring's magical effects and bonuses are restored as well as the lost hit points, but transmuted treasure is lost forever except as fertilizer",

If the ring is forcibly removed without the appropriate spell casting, the wearer continues to suffer all negative effects of the ring for five months, but gain none of the benefts until the ring is again worn. After a period of five months without wearing the ring, the curse is lifted; unfortunately, the hit point maximum is at 0% so the previous wearer is now deceased.",
