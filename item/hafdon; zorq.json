Each individual typically hunts alone and widely separated from the others, to ensure that everyone gets adequate fodder. The leader might organize members to work together to make a big kill.

If one is taken young and properly trained, a girallon could end up in a seemingly unlikely place, such as guarding the entrance to a city's thieves' guild.

After this time, the rot grub is too far under the host creature's skin to be burned. If a creature infested by one or more herg worms ends its turn with 0 hit points, it dies as the grubs burrow into its heart and kill it.
