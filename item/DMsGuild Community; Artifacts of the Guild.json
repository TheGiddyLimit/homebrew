On a successful melee attack, Luminaria deals an extra {@damage 1d6} fire damage and {@damage 1d6} radiant damage to any target she hits. The fiery radiant energy lasts until you use a bonus action to speak the command word again or until you drop or stow Luminaria.",
				"When you hit a fiend or an undead creature with Luminaria while she is illuminated, that creature takes an additional {@damage 2d6} radiant damage. If the target has 25 hit points or less after taking this radiant damage, it must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be destroyed. On a successful save, the creature becomes {@condition frightened} of you for 1 minute. While it is {@condition frightened} in this way, a creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If it has nowhere it can move, the creature can use the Dodge action. At the end of each of its turns, a creature can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.",
				"{@bold Divine Sense}. As an action you can cast the {@spell detect evil and good} spell at will. Additionally, you can cast the {@spell dispel evil and good} spell 3 times per day, restoring uses after a long rest.",
				"{@bold Healing Touch}. As an action you can touch another creature, causing it to magically regain {@dice 4d8+2} hit points. It is also freed from any curse, disease, poison, blindness, or deafness.",
				"This ability can be used 3 times per day, restoring uses after a long rest.",
				"{@bold Raise Dead}. Once per day, you can cast the {@spell raise dead} spell. This ability recharges upon the completion of a long rest.",
				"{@bold Radiant Bolt ({@recharge 5})}. As an action you can make a ranged spell attack against the target with a +9 to the attack roll, causing a flash of light to streak towards a creature of your choice within 120 feet. On a hit, the target takes {@damage 4d6} radiant damage, and the next attack roll made against this target before the end of your next turn has advantage, thanks to the mystical dim light left glittering on the target.",
				"This ability recharges on the roll of a 5 or 6 on a {@dice 1d6} and upon completion of a short or long rest. If you have 1st level spell slots or greater, you can use them to activate this spell-like ability again, and cast it at a higher level similar to the guiding bolt spell.",
				"{@bold Radiant Blast {@recharge 6}}. As an action, you create a bright streak of light to a point you choose within 150 feet, which erupts into an explosion of fiery radiance. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. A target takes {@damage 4d6} fire and {@damage 4d6} radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The fiery radiance spreads around corners. It ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.",
				"This ability recharges on the roll of a 6 on a {@dice 1d6} and upon completion of a short or long rest. If you have 3rd level spell slots or greater, you can use them to activate this spell-like ability again, and cast it at a higher level similar to the fireball spell.",
				"{@bold Sentience}. Luminaria is a sentient lawful good morningstar with an Intelligence of 17, a Wisdom of 20, and a Charisma of 20. She has hearing and {@sense darkvision} out to a range of 120 feet. She can speak and understand all languages, and can communicate telepathically up to a range of 120 feet. Her voice is divine and melodic.",
				"{@bold Personality}. Luminaria has many angelic qualities to her personality and is incapable of straying from the path of law and good. She will slay evil creatures without remorse, and feels she is never mistaken in her judgements. This quality gives off a sense of superiority in her, which is shown when her will conflicts with goals of others. She always speaks to her wielder in a respectful and courteous tone, but is far from being a pushover. She is here to aid mortals, not serve them.",
				"If Luminaria feels you are regularly straying from the divine path of law and good, she will give you warnings through telepathic communication. She does not want to have any part of assisting in acts she feels go against her divine nature and will try to persuade you to do the right thing."

He battle the undead, and quickly realized he was out matched. In a desperate attempt to revitalize the depleted shield, he accidentally drew life from an imprisoned villager, slaying the poor man. It was at this point his will broke and his dark adversary overwhelmed him. He was not slain. Instead he was turned by the vampire and became what he had hunted: a dark creature of the night.",

She was tough and fiery, and it was these traits that caused the people to select her, fearing her outspoken defiance would reach the castle and cause the Count to punish them. Instead they sought to appease him with her offering. She would not go quietly, and fought through the Dark Count's subtle charms and crushing grip, managing to strike and wound the powerful undead. In that moment Everam's lost hope reignited.",
