				"Thousands of years ago, a powerful alkemancer named Anuraag constructed an enormous crucible in his quest to create the perfect organism. He hoped it would bring forth an immortal being that could surpass the limitations imposed by human flesh and surpass even the gods. Anuraag used the crucible to create so many monstrosities that eventually the local deities had to take action against him. The alkemancer was destroyed for his impertinence, and his crucible was sealed away at the bottom of a mighty chasm.",

				"If one or more creatures are placed in the crucible and the crucible is heated over an intense, magical flame, each creature must make a {@dc 20} Constitution saving throw against the crucible's powerful transmutation magic. If this saving throw fails, the creature's body liquefies and the creature is {@condition blinded}, {@condition deafened}, and {@condition paralyzed} until the transformation is complete. The creature's equipment doesn't dissolve; as a result, most creatures are stripped naked before being placed in the crucible. Over the course of 10 minutes, the liquefied creature transforms into another creature.",
				"If this transformation is interrupted, the transforming creature is slain. It can be brought back to life in its original form by a {@spell resurrection} spell or similar magic.",

The transformed creature must make a successful {@dc 20} Wisdom saving throw or lose its memory and all its previous abilities, traits, and features, which are replaced by the blank mind of a newly born version of the creature it transformed into. Whether or not a creature retains its mental faculties, the newly assumed form is permanent. At that point, the creature can regain its former form (and memories and abilities) only through a {@spell wish} spell.",

He is said to have created his first great item of magic when he was still a young apprentice. At that time, his master was an old wizard who mercilessly drilled the fundamentals of magic into the young apprentice's mind. The studious old wizard also derisively dismissed Gax's ideas for combining magic and battle and openly berated Gax for his love of swordplay, weaponry, and armor.",
					"Determined to prove that his theories were possible (and, truth be told, equally determined to spite his master), Gax apprenticed himself at the same time to a renowned weapon smith and armorer in a nearby town. The youth quickly proved as skilled at metalcraft as he was at magic. Young Gax spent his days in magical study and his nights working in the smith's forge, crafting an exquisite breastplate of the finest mithral. He imbued the breastplate's delicate glyphs and symbols with powerful protective magic far beyond the ability of magic-wielders many years his senior.",
					"When the breastplate was finally completed, Gax proudly showed it to his mentor. The smith was so impressed that he coveted it for himself, and he demanded that Gax give the breastplate to him. When Gax refused, the smith attempted to take it by force. At the end of a quick but violent scuffle, the smith lay dead near the very anvil on which Gax had finished his wondrous breastplate. Shocked and terrified, the boy fled, running to the small stone building where the old wizard lived. Hoping the wizard would be understanding about what happened and suitably impressed with Gax's magical breastplate, the boy breathlessly recounted recent events.",
					"The old wizard was neither understanding norimpressed. He coldly chided Gax for wasting his timeon a \"trinket\" and rebuked Gax for taking a life over \"nothing more than a worthless piece of pretty metal.\" Furious and defeated, Gax shouted profanities at his master before running off into the woods.",
					"Gax decided that he would make his way in the world on his own terms. He would learn everything he could about magic and combat, he would excel in both, and he would do whatever it took to fuse the two into what would eventually become known as the style of the battlecaster.",

Slick and his companions had taken it upon themselves to eradicate the cult, eager for the accolades they would receive for defeating an evil in the community. The loot they stood to gain didn't hurt either.",
					"After the assault, while his companions were busy chasing the fleeing members of the cult, Slick pocketed the gem, disfiguring the statue and weakening its power in the process. He was then attacked by a cultist who had managed to evade notice by the adventurers. Slick escaped with his life, and the gem, but was unable to acquire the second eye. Within days, the thief was finding himself assaulted by devils and cultists. He quickly offloaded his loot with a collection of merchants in town, including a jeweler who was looking for an exquisite stone to use in a piece commissioned by a local noble. Slick then set off with his pockets full of coin, happily leaving the devilish drama behind.",
					"This magical amulet attracts the attention of worshippers of Mammon, who can almost sense its presence and are eager to claim its power for themselves, though a few extremely devout members of the weakened cult wish to return the gem to its original place in the idol. Due to this, and a bit of bad luck, this amulet has changed hands many times over the decades."

							"Decades ago, long before I possessed the scholarly renown I currently enjoy, my children came to dinner chattering and brim-full of faerie stories from their governess. From soup to cheese, they told tales of a hero possessed of a \"Folding Door\" that fit in his pocket. When \"unfolded\" to full size it could be set anywhere (a stone wall, a tree, a waterfall) and opened to anywhere in the wide world, whisking the hero and her companions away from trouble in a trice.",

Centuries ago, a wizard named Foulton Konig was famed for creating magical doors. Sadly, specific details are lacking as his labs, libraries, and notes were lost when his mansion was destroyed in a catastrophically thorough, but historically non\u2011specific way.",
							"My children were fascinated to hear my theory that metaplasmic drift in the language (doubtless working in concert with poor education and rustic accents) eventually led a genuine product of magical artifice (a door made by Foulton) to eventually enter folklore as a \"Folding Door.\"",
							"This was my first brush with my eventual life's work and passion: my endless quest to separate the history of artifice from stories of the artificial. As such, I feel an odd gratitude toward their old governess, and occasionally feel a bit of remorse about ending her employment over the incident. Still, there are genuine wonders aplenty in the world without cluttering the minds of the young with nonsense.",
							"Mine is an endless struggle to separate fact from fancy, as shown by events of three months ago. Out conducting research, (while cunningly disguised to mix among the common folk) a seemingly reputable vendor of magical curiosities offered to sell me \"a fragment of a Foulton Door.\" (Note Fig 1. a splinter of wood, slightly longer than a handspan across.) Destroyed long ago, so powerful were the original doors that if even a small piece such as this were incorporated into an existing door, it would become imbued with the power of a magic portal. A quick check revealed the shard of wood did, in fact, possess a powerful, unfamiliar dweomer.",
							"With dubious curiosity, I bought it, returned to my lab, and followed their instructions. My tools and talents are not designed for anything so base as carpentry, but in the pursuit of truth I dutifully paid several hours of my precious time, a set of skinned knuckles, and one badly hammered thumb to patch the small piece of wood into one of the secondary pantry's doors.",
							"I then inserted the key to my winter lodgings, concentrated, and opened the door as the merchant had instructed me. Nothing happened, of course, and when I checked, the wood no longer showed any traces of magic.",
							"When I returned to the merchant to demand both an ethical and economic accounting, he had the audacity to imply it was my own fault, and refused to admit his obvious charlatanry or refund the twenty gold I had spent. While I regularly spend much greater sums in the course of my research, I nevertheless engaged the constabulary to bring the fellow into custody, as behavior such as this does nothing but defraud the simple-minded and tarnish the reputation of those engaging in legitimate arcane pursuits...."

Gax always told his friend that true strength comes from within, but Riggs continued to lament his physical weakness and size.

It is believed that Riggs bestowed his magical gauntlets to his student on his deathbed, though the girl remained silent on the subject. She left the village a few days after her mentor's death to make her mark on the world. If she had Riggs's gauntlets of the arcane fist with her when she left, none can say."

The order claimed that wizards, sorcerers, and their ilk were to blame for all the evil in the land as that magic was tainted by human hands rather than gifted by divine ones.",
					"Lord Ventu held tremendous sway in the kingdom, and he brought that considerable power to bear on his self-appointed mission of wiping out every last practitioner of magic in the land who wielded magic without the blessing of a deity.",
					"Thus began the {@i Purge Arcana}.",
					"To carry out the {@i Purge Arcana}, Ventu needed loyal warriors who could seek out and destroy practitioners of the arcane arts. To this end, he assembled a squad of like-minded zealots, and he outfitted them with breastplates enchanted by priests of his deity to neutralize magic and aid in killing those that wielded it.",
					"For years, Ventu's Mage Hunters scoured his kingdom, killing anyone who dared to practice magic. It was a dark and dangerous time, filled with fear and paranoia. Over time, Ventu grew increasingly paranoid, and his actions became more and more bizarre. Eventually, he decided that even his own Mage Hunters had become tainted by prolonged contact with the very magic that they were tasked to destroy. He summoned his most loyal soldiers and ordered them to round up and murder the Mage Hunters. For the Mage Hunters, it was the final straw. Many fled the kingdom in fear, but a few banded together and stormed Ventu's fortress. They killed the mad zealot then looked on his lifeless body in shocked disbelief. The Mage Hunters were appalled at what they had done, but they were even more appalled at what had transpired in the kingdom. It was as if Ventu had woven a spell on everyone and, now that he was dead, the spell was broken. The Mage Hunters disbanded. Most renounced what they had done and destroyed their magical breastplates. Most, but not all..."
