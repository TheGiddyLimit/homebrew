				"{@bold Features} (GM): The armor itself is nothing so much as a lightweight scarf wrapped around one's midsection. It offers no protection from the elements or natural hazards and is extremely fragile. However, any and all attack rolls against the wearer are made at against an AC representative of the illusion the wearer desires (and he can reset once per day). The more unbelievable and rare the armor imagined, the lower the DC Wis save to disbelieve it is real. Once per scene, a creature may have a Wis save to disbelieve the armor upon first seeing it. On a success, there is no armor, only a pale pink and green scarf (ugly at that) wrapped around the wearer's midsection. On a failure, the armor is \"real\" to that person for the scene. Simple common light armor is a DC23, medium armor DC18, heavy armor DC13. Every resistance added to the armor (represented by appropriate visual effects on the illusory armor like a bluish glow for cold or skulls for necrotic) decreases the DC by 5. So, \"wearing\" slashing resistance heavy plate (plate with \"great rounded and smoothly polished guards to deflect blades\") is a Wis save DC 8 for all creatures the first time they see it and every scene thereafter. \"Taking off\" the armor or putting other armor on gives all the observers a new save immediately with advantage."

His was a smug satisfaction at the invulnerable splendor encasing his body... right up until his squire, an old cutpurse Paulo had pressed into service from the capitol took a moment and squinted at him. The look on the old, toothless man's face went from curiosity to disbelief to annoyance to determination as he walked up close and put a knife through Paulo's heavy steel gorget, mail, leather, and throat. As he bled out on the ground, the old thief spit... \"lying twat\"."

Close inspection shows that its leathery surface is (morbidly) made from perfectly cut herring-bone patches of skin\u2014each as small as a coin.  The skins patches were trophies kept by The Haxian, a zealous cleric three-hundred years ago responsible for cleansing the Ophea of the monsterous undead.  Each patch was cut from the forehead of an undead creature slain by his wrath.",
				"In the center of the shield is the cleric's crown (the bone dome of his skull) polished to a high gloss shine, an ivory-white irregular circle nearly six inches across.",
				"Attunement to the shield requires the killing of a necromancer, his last moments of life leaving his body while on the shield.  For this reason combined with the oddly unearthly materials of the shield, most of the faith's champions\u2014even the most righteous and intense\u2014find themselves unequal to bearing it.",
				"Once attuned however, the shield provides two boons to the bearer.   First, on any surprise round, if the wielder gets to take a turn, they may use their reaction to smack the rim of the shield against any hard surface to cause a flash of pure, radiant, divine light to arc out around them. This light has the effect of causing any undead creature to lose their turn in the surprise round.",
				"Second, the wielder may take an action to use the shield to bash (as an improvised weapon doing +0 magical 1d4 + Strength bludgeoning; any features, feats, or other rules allowing for shield bash with proficiency bonus may apply if applicable).  This bash forces the Diseased condition on any undead creatures, even if they are Immune."

The Child had never touched this world directly, though its servants had murdered nations in the past to bring that about. Had it not been for the sacrifice of every last living member of the Intuer Clan in fighting back the first few steps of the infant demigod into the world, there would be no living thing left today. But, Lanaria of the Wild\u2014the Clan's matriarch\u2014fought it back through the tear in reality and fashioned a ceremonial trophy cray from the hide of the arm that had clawed its way through.",
				"The Cray of the Dead God is a length of grey and irregularly blackened hide as wide as a man's two fingers at the narrowest points and up to a foot wide at the broadest. It's roughly fifteen feet long, ragged-edged and coarse. Attunement requires a careful, ritualistic wrapping of the leather around one's body in a ceremonial observance of one's own possible and welcomed (if the spirits demand it) death; Religion check DC20 to get it right, DC 10 for Barbarians. Failure on this check means one cannot properly work the garment/armor for a number of weeks equal to one's level.",
				"One attuned, the armor grants the wearer an inconsistent, but powerful defense against damage. Give the player 9 cards from a conventional deck (2 through 10, each number once), then from the remaining deck, the DM draws one card and places it face down on the table. The PC has an armor class of 10 + their Dex modifier (as though unarmored), and with a Reaction (can be done in response to being hit), the Player may play any card from their hand to increase the AC of the character by that amount. That AC is the standing AC for the character until they are successful hit (even if no damage is done), then it returns to 10 + Dex modifier. When the player uses a card, it is discarded and they cannot use it again.",
				"At any point, the player may ask that the DM's card be used (this is done blind, they do not know the value). It also goes away on a successful hit. Only when all the player's cards have been used can they be re-dealt 2-10 again (and the DM redraws a single card, as at the start; discarding whatever they had, if they still have one).",

				"{@bold Features} (GM): The Gloves of Ynx were once a common item amongst the Swordsmarche. Attunement requires a morning prayer at dawn with one's favored weapon and the abandonment of proficiency in three weapons of one's choice from the standard list of Martial Weapons. Once selected, one may regain proficiency as any other character might through downtime or feats, but with those weapons until that time one has no proficiency\u2014one has abandoned the lesser metal to focus on the true weapons of war. From there, the gloves grant the wearer the ability to engage a specialized Grapple with an attacking, armed foe. In reaction to either an attack roll attempt or a successful hit, the wearer of the gloves may use their already in-hand weapon to block and grapple the strike. One must choose to use this ability when an attack is declared, if not one may choose to use this ability when an attack successfully hits; if one does not use the ability on the declared attack and the attack misses, one cannot go back and choose to use it. Using their Reaction, the wearer may block the strike with their weapon\u2014the wearer and the opponent now locked in a fierce weapon-to-weapon clash. This grapple has the added condition of preventing either party from moving the other (all movement is 0 for both) as well as requiring both hands of each to maintain (thus, no attacks while locked together). At the start of each participant's turn, they may attempt to overpower the other by attempting an Acrobatics or Athletics versus the other one's Athletics (only). The larger weapon (determined by damage dice) is considered to be advantaged in this check. On a successful overpower, the opponent is either knocked prone or shoved back 5 ft. (winner's choice). On a natural 20 on the overpower roll, the winner may choose to do both. After combat, the survivors gain 1 exhaustion for every such overpower they succeed at. This exhaustion may be removed with 1 hit dice for each point, without the need for a short rest, and via normal rules and spells."
