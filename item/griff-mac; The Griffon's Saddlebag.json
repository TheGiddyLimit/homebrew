He'd worked on it for the last five days, keeping to himself and subjecting his fiery tiefling blood to the cold, roaring winds of the wintry outdoors. It was all worth it, though, if it was for her. He held his breath as she opened the lid.",

If you drop the whip while a creature is gripped by the tentacle, both your and the creature's movement returns to normal, although the tentacle will continue to hold and damage the creature until it breaks free."
