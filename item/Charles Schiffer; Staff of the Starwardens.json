					"*Staff, very rare (requires attunement by a druid)*",
					"This staff was wrought from a branch that fell from a tree in a druid grove. Several star-like motes of light orbit the tip of the staff, shedding bright light in its space and dim light for 5 feet beyond its space.",
					"The staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff, and it is always under the effects of {@spell shillelagh} for you. While holding it, you have a +3 bonus to spell attack rolls and the saving throw DC of your druid spells.",
					"You can use an action to cast  {@spell pass without trace} from the staff.",
					"***Healing Gleam***. When you cast a spell that restores hit points, you can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to the amount of hit points restored, provided you are holding the staff.",
					"***Searing Shine***. When you cast a spell that deals fire or radiant damage, you can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to the amount of damage dealt, provided you are holding the staff. ",
					"***Tree Form.*** You can use an action to plant one end of the staff in fertile earth to transform the staff into a healthy tree. The tree is 60 feet tall and has a 5-foot-diameter trunk, and its branches at the top spread out in a 20-foot radius.",
					"The tree has star-like motes of light floating around it, shedding dim light for 10 feet, but otherwise appears ordinary; it radiates a faint aura of transmutation magic if targeted by {@spell detect magic}. While touching the tree and using another action to speak its command, word, you return the staff to its normal form. Any creature in the tree falls when it reverts to a staff."
