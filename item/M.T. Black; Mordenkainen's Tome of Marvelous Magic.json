								"I have travelled to more worlds than I can easily recall, and I have seen more items of marvelous magic than I could record in a book of infinite pages. Many of these wonders I have possessed at one time or another, some I have merely observed, while others I know of only by reputation.",
								"It is true that I once studied and collected magic for the sole purpose of accruing power, and I was more successful than most in this endeavour. Yet power becomes a perilous narcotic when sought for its own sake. Your desire always exceeds your capacity, and so you grow less satisfied rather than more, even as you increase your potency. Logicians would term this a \"vicious circle.\"",
								"It was while conducting certain hazardous experiments on Avernus, many years past, that I had a revelation. Or perhaps the revelation was given me\u2014if so, it is the first time the gods have ever bequeathed me anything of use. Regardless, this was when I realized what is now common knowledge amongst the learned: that the equilibrium between the infernal and the diabolical forces prevents either from dominating. Or, to put it more plainly, if either the devils or demons ever gained the upper hand in their struggle, they would soon overrun the multiverse.",
								"This (along with several other experiences and a considerable amount of self-reflection) eventually led me to embrace the doctrine of the Balance, which states that the stability and sanity of the world depends upon the maintenance of an equilibrium rather than the triumph of any one force over the other. I could say much more about this, but I am preaching to the converted.",
								"These latter years I have spent accruing knowledge for those who, like myself, are committed to the preservation of Balance. This volume documents two hundred magical items that are particularly powerful or practical. Precise knowledge of these objects permits you to either utilize or thwart them, as well as helping you to find or create the said item in the first place. Therefore, this volume is remarkably powerful and dangerous, and I've made just eight copies to be placed in the hands of those I trust.",
								"If this volume somehow falls into the hands of some other, I can only hope (I will not pray) that you will tread lightly, be wary, and (may it be so) act wisely."

										"My dear friend,",
										"I have, at considerable risk to myself, made a copy of my master's great work and have included it in this package. Mordenkainen remains a great wizard, perhaps the greatest of them all, but he has grown increasingly paranoid in his twilight years and jealously guards his knowledge. He has spoken more than once recently about burning down his entire library, lest it fall into the wrong hands. As a scholar myself, I cannot allow this to come to pass. Indeed, I have done questionable things to ensure that it does not.",
										"In your recent note, you asked me to explain why Mordenkainen is so zealous for the Balance. I can best do so by repeating to you a story he has told me often. There was once a mayor whose son died after a bite from a diseased rat, and so she engaged an enchanter to kill all the rats in town. Now, it so happened that most of the local lizards fed on those rats, and soon there were no lizards to be found either. But the lizards also fed on certain insects, and these could now breed without restraint. Great swarms of these insects descended upon the town's crops, and much famine and death followed, and the whole town was finally abandoned. Thus, we see the folly of interfering with the great Balance, even in a small way. But I am no preacher\u2014should you ever meet Mordenkainen yourself, he will relate a hundred such anecdotes to you.",
										"But for now, I pray you will use this book wisely, and remember to keep its existence secret!"
