										"This book is a portion of what used to be a larger product of the same name. As the {@i Comprehensive Equipment Manual} developed, the product became too large. What started as an expansion of the {@book equipment chapter of the Player's Handbook|PHB|5} became a multifaceted project that was approaching 500 pages. This necessitated a split into multiple books because products of such a size are unwieldly and inefficient in several ways, ways that are touched upon here.",
										"First, as the topics covered by this book expanded, it became very clear that \"equipment\" fell naturally into several categories; the {@i Comprehensive Equipment Manual} gets accessed by different users in different ways, and certain sections are wholly-irrelevant to readers who are not Dungeon Masters. In this way, a patron of the {@i Comprehensive Equipment Manual} is buying multiple products combined, and many users are ignoring large sections of the book.",
										"Second, opening and navigating a single PDF of this size can sorely tax the abilities of many computers, particularly a smartphone or tablet of the type that players might use around a table. Our continuing addition of high-density art assets further exacerbates this problem.",
										"Third, printing the book becomes a chore for those who want to use it in some physical form, particularly because each user type needs only certain portions of the document. Additionally, the print-on-demand options become impossible at such high page ranges due to the limitations of print-providing services, including for the one the Dungeon Masters Guild uses to deliver print-on-demand books.",
										"Fourth, but not of least relevance, separating the product into its natural components helps to recognize and reward the ongoing work put into this product over the last two years. A single book necessarily uses a diminishing value scale with its increasing size, relative to what the market will bear. Making it into separate books serves users with slimmer slices, providing the exact content they are looking for at a price point that is fair and is adequate to pay the artists, contractors, and other contributors.",

If characters don't have time to seek out the best price, perhaps needing spells cast the same day, the DM will multiply the base cost in the Pay column by a number indicated in the range of the Multiplier column. Spellcasters don't like to be rushed and are often willing to inflate their costs to whatever the market will bear. This multiplier can also be applied for various other reasons. Perhaps the person seeking spellcasting services annoys the spellcaster, or the spellcaster normally reserves such services for members of a specific race or religion. There are any number of reasons that such a markup could apply; the Pay column simply represents an ideal cost derived from ideal circumstances."

This ensures that the components are on hand when needed and are of the right type and quality for the spell to succeed. If a spell requires a costly material component, the person receiving the service must bear the cost. This is additional to the basic price of the spellcasting service. When looking for spellcasting services, it's no good bringing your own material components; a spellcaster that provides commercially-available casting has already invested in the components and won't look kindly on you trying to reduce these expected fees by offering cheap alternative components from dubious sources.",
												"If a costly material component is not consumed in the casting, the customer need only pay one-tenth of the component's value. For example, the 100 gp pearl required for an {@spell identify} spell is reusable, so the caster charges only one-tenth (10 gp) of its acquisition price. After a while, the spellcaster may recoup the investment cost of having such a component on hand and might eventually turn a small profit on it.",
												"If the material component is one that is consumed in the casting, the customer must normally pay {@i double} the component's value. For example, the 500 gp value in diamonds needed for a {@spell raise dead} spell would require the buyer to lay out double the expense (1,000 gp). Casters who market their spells invest serious coin to acquire these components, tying up that wealth until the right customer comes along. The inflated price compensates them for holding onto these expensive inventories, having them ready at a moment's notice."

Many clerics see this sort of thing as their duty and don't mind supplicants who supply their own material components. Some clerics also see this as a great opportunity to proselytize, not restricting their services to members of their own faith.",
												"Another way to get free spellcasting is to perform tasks or quests for a spellcaster. This is a particularlyappropriate exchange when the spell needed is highlevel and the party is too low-level to afford it. For example, if a low-level party needs a member raised from the dead, they might need to go on a quest to repay the cleric who casts the spell.

Improvising piercing damage is an \"intended\" use and should include the user's proficiency bonus.

Additional food in a day is hard to process and does not reduce the count any faster.",

With this optional rule, the act of controlling a mount with animal-level Intelligence (a score of 1 to 3) requires the rider to \"interact\" with the reigns or other control mechanisms. (Characters are allowed one interaction with an object or with the environment each round, as explained in the Players Handbook, typically used for drawing a weapon, opening a door, or other simple manipulation of items.) If the rider fails to use an interaction to control the mount, the mount acts according to its nature and training on its next turn, as decided by the Dungeon Master.

The attacker's mount must also be larger in size than the targeted rider. (It does not need to be larger than the target's mount.) If a lancer can make multiple attacks in a turn, only the first attack following this \"charge\" has a chance to dismount the target.",

The size and bulk of the combat lance and jousting lance make them too unwieldy for one-handed use from the back of such a small mount.

						"The Firearms 1 list represents \"medieval\" firearms, basic, front-loaded weapons fired by the literal application of fire. These are often more expensive than their benefits justify. Very few warriors make use of them, and they appear only as curios or for very specialized battlefield roles. For example, a squad of fusiliers might stand ready to harass enemy knights that approach the command pavilion; such weapons may punch through metal armor and their noise and fumes may unsettle the horses.",
						"The Firearms 2 list represents \"renaissance\" development. These weapons are still fired by igniting open powder but advances in design make them less susceptible to the ravages of the environment. Firearms of this sort are common among soldiers and genteel folk, despite long loading times. Musketeers might fire long guns before advancing with bayonets, or simply stand off and fire in slow volleys. A gallant caballero might fire a pistol and then drop it, closing with a rapier and poniard to finish the fight.",
						"The Firearms 3 list represents \"machine age\" development, when some components of firearms can be mass manufactured. The greatest evolution of this tier of technology is a weapon's ability to hold more loads of ammunition than its number of barrels, an advancement built on the newfound reliability of metal alloy cartridge casings. At this stage of development, firearms are very common. Only the high costs of their use and construction keep them from overshadowing other types of weapons on the battlefield. At this tier of development, a firearmsfocused character will make most attacks using firearms and will only carry other weapons to use in an emergency or when stealth is needed.",

This works only on weapons from the Firearms 1 and 2 limited lists.

Moreover, some gun prices, the so-called \"starter\" guns, are priced to allow players to access them at character creation using the Item Swaps variant rule from chapter 1. This is particularly important in campaigns where some of the characters are expected to possess firearms from the beginning.",

This \"exotic\" cost means that the weapons and adventuring gear the tables of this chapter have a base cost that is {@b 5 times} what is shown.

												"Firearms of this era are characterized by significant advantages over earlier types. These weapons use machined metal cartridges for their ammunition, rather than packing powder and lead separately. These metal cartridges supplement the rigidity of the weapon's firing chamber, making it practical to breach-load machine age guns. Ammunition is no longer loaded into the business end of each barrel.",

No longer are dashing cavaliers limited to a single shot on the battlefield or carrying a brace of loaded pistols alongside their melee weapons. Nor are battle lines of fusiliers limited to staggered volleys.",

The precision and durability of parts necessitates using large presses, lathes, or other nonportable equipment in their crafting.

If the Dungeon Master wishes to use a different culture as the primary influence for the campaign, most of the equipment here (and in earlier chapters) can be translated into differently-named gear with the same functionality. {@book Page 41|DMG|1|Wuxia} of the Dungeon Master's Guide charts alternate names for Chinese and Japanese versions of the same historic weapons. This is an excellent starting point. The Internet is likewise a valuable source for equivalent names relative to different cultures.",
										"While the equipment of this limited list is influenced by a particular culture in time, it is not an historic representation of any culture's style or usage of said equipment. The rules for these items and their configurations reach no further than the needs of a fantasy game and should not be treated as anything historic, authoritative, or representative."

In your campaign, the Dungeon Master might think that acquiring a suit of metal armor should therefore grant more benefits than simply avoiding the occasional repairs needed for ersatz armors. There are a couple of approaches that can be used to give metal armor greater benefits.",
												"The DM might make steel armor quasi-magical, like adamantine or mithral armor. Such armors might include an inherent +1 benefit like {@item +1 Armor||magic armor}. However, this approach risks offending the bounded accuracy model of the 5th Edition's mechanics and it leaves little room to apply standard enchantments to metal armor.",
												"Another approach is to apply a very limited form of damage reduction. While wearing a suit of metal light armor, bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from non-magical ersatz weapons is reduced by 1.

						"The core rules have only a few spellcasting focuses that are also weapons. The staff and wooden staff are explicitly quarterstaffs according to the Dungeon Master's Guide. Similarly, many rods can qualify as clubs with the improvised weapon rules. However, these are uncommon; a character casting spells often foregoes holding a weapon simultaneously.",
						"This chapter allows characters to turn other weapons into spellcasting focuses, weapons that are more useful to martially-inclined characters. For example, while an eldritch knight can already wield a staff arcane focus to get the benefits of both a weapon and a focus, this is probably not the character's first, best choice for a weapon.",
						"Some may argue that the advantage of making other weapons into focuses is small, and that many campaigns already ignore the minutia of deploying spell components. However, the advantage is a real and significant one for some campaigns. It is therefore called out here as a System Change; the Dungeon Master may disallow these focuses, the ones marked on the table with an asterisk (*)."
