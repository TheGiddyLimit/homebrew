				"Whenever you reduce a humanoid to 0 hit points, you can use your reaction to attempt to trap their soul inside the bracer. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw; a creature can choose to fail this saving throw if it wishes. On a successful save its soul departs as normal. On a failed save, its soul is trapped within the bracer. If the creature is wearing any items meant to trap or redirect its soul after death, such as a {@item ring of mind shielding}, the bracer fails. A creature whose soul is trapped in the bracer can only be restored to life by a {@spell wish} spell, which removes the soul from the bracer.",
				"While the bracer contains a soul, you use an action to take on the appearance of the body the soul belonged to, as if you had cast the {@spell alter self} spell. While transformed, you can cast the detect thoughts spell from the bracer at will but can target only the soul when you do so. The transformation lasts for a maximum duration of 1 hour, after which you revert to your regular form. The transformation also ends if you take off the bracer. This property of the bracer can't be used again until the next dawn.",
				"A creature trapped in the bracer is aware of the passage of time and retains its personality and memory. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet and can communicate telepathically with the bearer of the bracer.",
				"Once every 30 days, the soul can repeat the saving throw. On a success, the soul departs as normal."
