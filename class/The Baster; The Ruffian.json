One shouldn't worry about a Ruffian that aggressively charges, for they are desperate. One should worry for the Ruffian patiently waiting, enduring hits and striking once their foes get tired.",

								"The night darkens in the alleys of the underworld of an ancient dwarven city. Strength now rules as the law of the streets. A beefy female Half-Orc fights with a Goliath Brute over a pile of stolen supplies. Two Bugbears beat up a spindly Halfling for not providing requested goods. A crime lord sends his thugs to infiltrate the mansion of a noble that is standing in their way.",
								"Ruffians are often considered the worst of the worst. They punch first, and ask questions later. Life on the streets has taken its toll from them. The question is not, if a Ruffian has scars, but how many... and where did they come from. Each scar tells a story, of loss, of victory and of false hope. The lot of the Ruffian is often a dark and meaningless one. Most have given up on writing their own story. Instead they serve corrupt leaders and get their hands dirty for other peoples cirmes.",

										"A Ruffian can always take a punch. They are used to being shot at or feeling a knife in their back. A lifetime of fighting has made them as endurable as their anatomy allows. In combat, they ravel in their own sustainability, showing remarkable bursts of strength and endurance at surprising moments. One shouldn't worry about a Ruffian that aggressively charges, for they are desperate. One should worry for the Ruffian patiently waiting, enduring hits and striking once their foes get tired.",
										"A grim life mustn't always lead to a grim personality, though. While most Ruffians aren't very intelligent or wise, some can be witty and charming. Not every mountain of muscles is also a hallow shell. Sweet talk can get you a long way in the underworlds of the universe. And someone who has survived as long as the Ruffians have, certainly know, what to say... and when."

How did they come to join an adventuring party? Are they just brawns or also brains? Do they use their strength to take what they want? Or do they only use it to protect what they have?",
										"Of course a Ruffian doesn't have to hail from the underworld or have a criminal background. Maybe they are a noble, that has been boxing for their whole life. Perhaps they are part of a circus. Or they just have a great physique that lets them endure a lot of hits.
