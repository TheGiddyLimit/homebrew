One shouldn't worry about a Ruffian that aggressively charges, for they are desperate. One should worry for the Ruffian patiently waiting, enduring hits and striking once their foes get tired.",

										"When creating a Ruffian, think about their upbringing. Ruffians are mostly used to a rough life in the streets with little who cares for them and little they care for. How did they come to join an adventuring party? Are they just brawns or also brains? Do they use their strength to take what they want? Or do they only use it to protect what they have?",
										"Of course a Ruffian doesn't have to hail from the underworld or have a criminal background. Maybe they are a noble, that has been boxing for their whole life. Perhaps they are part of a circus. Or they just have a great physique that lets them endure a lot of hits. It is important to note, that a Ruffian doesn't have to be a dumb brute who prefers violent solutions over everything.",

												"You can create a ruffian quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Constitution your highest ability score. Your next-highest score should be Strength. You third-highest score depends on your playstyle. Dexterity, if you want to increase your Initiative and Armor Class; and Charisma, if you want your taunts and fears to be more effective. Second, choose the criminal/spy background."
