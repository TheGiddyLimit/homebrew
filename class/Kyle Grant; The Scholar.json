						"A human general, clad in gleaming armor, studies the map on the table in front of him, covered in figurines that represent units of his soldiers and invading orcs.

Unrolling a sheaf of parchment, she sketches in new features on an expertly drawn map and then motions for the caravan to follow, leading them deeper into unknown territory in search of treasure and knowledge. ",
						"The halfling's medical kit opens with a snap, and he quickly starts removing instruments and vials as he looks over his patient, coming to a diagnosis as he observes her symptoms. He mixes a tincture and applies a salve to her lesions. Her condition is advanced, but not beyond his skills. As he administers the treatment he glances up and sees his next patient coming through the door, nursing a wrist bent to an odd angle. He reaches into his bag for a splint as he takes back the vial with his tincture.",

This distinction is critical to scholars, a defining aspect of the curiosity that drives them to learn and to  adventure. The wisest among them realizes that, while there may be no unsolvable mysteries, no single mortal can hope to solve them all. And so, for many, learning is a lifelong pursuit. ",
								"For the truly curious, the adventuring life is the only way to expand one's horizons of knowledge and build one's skill. Any scholar worth his salt will agree that libraries and laboratories are excellent avenues for learning, but no books or beakers contain the knowledge still waiting to be discovered beyond the frontier or in the crucible of battle. The scholar believes that every student reaches a point where the most effective path to higher learning is hands-on experience. The world is full of discoveries waiting to be made. ",
								"While most scholars have broad intellectual interests, all of them pursue a particular field of expertise to which they have likely dedicated years of study before becoming adventurers. The pursuits are widely varied, but there are still many characteristics that are shared by all scholars. For example, though not all scholars will relish the opportunity to fight, all of them possess a keen intellect that allows them to exploit opportunities on the battlefield.",
