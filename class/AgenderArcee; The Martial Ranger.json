						"Rough and wild looking, a human stalks alone through the shadows of trees, hunting the orcs he knows are planning a raid on a nearby farm. Clutching a shortsword in each hand, he becomes a whirlwind of steel, cutting down one enemy after another.",
						"After tumbling away from a cone of freezing air, an elf finds her feet and draws back her bow to loose an arrow at the white dragon. Shrugging off the wave of fear that emanates from the dragon like the cold of its breath, she sends one arrow after another to find the gaps between the dragon's thick scales.",
						"Holding his hand high, a half-elf whistles to the hawk that circles high above him, calling the bird back to his side. Whispering instructions in Elvish, he points to the owlbear he's been tracking and sends the hawk to distract the creature while he readies his bow.",

								"Rangers may live on the fringes of civilization, but the wilderness is their true home. Rangers have a deep connection to the land they make their home, and all its flora and fauna. Living off the land is second nature to them: they are well-versed in tracking, hunting and gathering, reading the subtle messages hidden in the terrain. The ranger lives in this world, yet stands apart from it; their knowledge, ingenuity and craftsmanship set them apart from wild beasts. Instead, the ranger lives in balance between nature and civilization, one foot in each world, protecting each from the other's encroachment, and threats from beyond.",
								"As master warriors of the wilderness, rangers are rarely satisfied with mundane quarry, and learn specialized techniques to hunt the monsters that threaten their beloved balance: humanoid raiders, rampaging beasts and monstrosities, terrible giants, and deadly dragons. They learn to track their quarry as a predator does, moving stealthily through the wilds and hiding themselves in brush and rubble. Once they have the scent, a ranger will follow their prey to the ends of the earth, and finish them with deadly skill."

Taking little with them but what they can carry and perhaps a beast companion, these rangers pursue the calling of the adventurer.",
								"Accustomed to life far from the comforts of a dry bed and a hot bath, rangers are well-suited to the adventuring lifestyle, though their fierce independence may put them at odds with fellow travelers. Faced with city-bred adventurers who grouse and whine about the hardships of the wild, rangers respond with some mixture of amusement, frustration, and compassion. But they quickly learn that other adventurers who can carry their own weight in a fight are worth any extra burden. Coddled city folk might not know how to feed themselves or find fresh water in the wild, but they make up for it in other ways."

								"I've always really liked the idea of a character who fits the ranger archetype\u2014a master of the wilderness, highly skilled at tracking and foraging, a precise and deadly hunter\u2014without having to be a half-druid. I'm definitely not opposed to the magical ranger, I just feel like there's room for the mundane kind, too.",
								"The {@class Rogue|PHB|Scout Rogue|Scout|XGE} does a pretty good job - a mobile ambusher at home in the wild - but it's missing something. It still plays like a {@class rogue|PHB}, focused on getting one big Sneak Attack off per turn, whereas the ranger is traditionally more about multiple quick attacks. Also, the only actual nature-specific flavor is one 3rd-level trait, which is just extra Expertise\u2014not terrible, but a bit bland.",
								"Early on in 5e's lifespan, a {@class Ranger (Spell-less)|UAModifyingClasses|spell-less ranger} rework was proposed in the {@link Modifying Classes UA article|https://dnd.wizards.com/articles/unearthed-arcana/modifying-classes}. This was a decent attempt, but mostly served to turn the ranger into a {@class Fighter|PHB|Battle Master|Battle Master} with some healing capability and poison resistance. {@classFeature Call Natural Allies|Ranger (Spell-less)|UAModifyingClasses|13} also feels too much like magic to me. It also does nothing to address the classic complaints about the 5e ranger, namely that their class features are too niche and weak, mostly focused around exploration rules that often get ignored anyway.",
								"In 2019, Pathfinder Second Edition released with a {@link new version of the ranger|https://pf2etools.com/classes.html#ranger_crb} that was quite well-received, and notably did not automatically have spells (which could later be obtained {@link through feats|https://pf2etools.com/feats.html#aerial%20boomerang_pt%3akin,flstclass:ranger=1,flopclass:extend}). This followed in the tradition of the Fourth Edition ranger. This ranger has an innate {@spell hunter's mark}-like feature called {@link Hunt Prey|https://pf2etools.com/classes.html#ranger_crb,state:feature=s0-2#accurate%20flurry_apg}, which has one of three effects based on your choice of {@link Hunter's Edge feature|https://pf2etools.com/classes.html#ranger_crb,state:feature=s0-3#accurate%20flurry_apg}, taking the place of a subclass. This ability, and several later features and feats of the class, provided some great inspiration for what a spell-less ranger can look like.",
								"Then, {@book Tasha's Cauldron of Everything|TCE} came out and included some nice enhancements for the 5e ranger class via {@5etools variant features|classes.html#ranger_phb,flstsource:dmg=0~erlw=0~egw=0~exploringeberron=0~ftd=0~ggr=0~mot=0~phb=0~scag=0~tdcsr=0~vrgr=0~xge=0,flopsource:extend,flstmiscellaneous:reprinted=0~sidekick=0,flopmiscellaneous:extend}. I liked the additions provided by {@classFeature Deft Explorer|Ranger|PHB|1|TCE}, but wasn't a fan of how they replaced Natural Explorer altogether\u2014I think it's best to keep that niche exploration flavor but buff it to be more useful in a combat-focused game. Additionally, a lot of Tasha's improvements add extra spells or magical effects\u2014see how the {@subclassFeature Primal Companion|Ranger|PHB|Beast Master|PHB|3|TCE|Beast Master now uses a primal spirit instead of a trained animal}\u2014turning the ranger into what increasingly feels like a druid with a bow.",
								"Despite my dalliance with {@link Pathfinder|https://pf2etools.com/} I still love {@5etools D&D Fifth Edition|index.html}, and I wanted to be make this kind of ranger available to 5e players. It's meant to be a robust martial class, with mechanics that are engaging but also easy to use. I kept a close eye on the other martial classes in the game, to make sure that this ranger could keep up with them without stepping on their toes, and could complement them through multiclassing without being too powerful.",
								"Keeping all these inspirations and considerations in mind, and doing my best to make up for lost spell utility while staying in balance with all other classes, I give you the {@class Martial Ranger|TMR}. I hope you enjoy!"

The ranger lives in this world, yet stands apart from it; their knowledge, ingenuity and craftsmanship set them apart from wild beasts. Instead, the ranger lives in balance between nature and civilization, one foot in each world, protecting each from the other's encroachment, and threats from beyond.",

They learn to track their quarry as a predator does, moving stealthily through the wilds and hiding themselves in brush and rubble. Once they have the scent, a ranger will follow their prey to the ends of the earth, and finish them with deadly skill."

But they quickly learn that other adventurers who can carry their own weight in a fight are worth any extra burden.
