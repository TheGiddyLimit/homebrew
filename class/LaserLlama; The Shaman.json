Gripping the ancestral war club of her tribe, she called upon the spirits of previous champions to empower her strikes. A cold wind came over the hobgoblin camp as the half-orc walked into their midst. These raiders who had dared to take lumber from the ancestral forest of her people would not live to see the dawn.",

Just before the monster fell upon him, the elder embraced the spirit of the Great Beast and shapeshifted into a supernaturally massive bear. The two collided with thunderous force, but only one would survive. The eyes of the great bear flashed with a momentary green light and as suddenly as it had appeared, an elderly halfling stood in its place, his eyes glowing with green light.",

A single man stood and thrust his spear toward the terrifying wyrm, but before the dragon could deflect the blow, the elf unleashed a powerful spirit from within one of her Totems. In an instant, the spirit had enveloped the dragon, temporarily sapping its strength. In its weakened state, the spear pierced the great beast's heart, ending its campaign of terror. The elf made her way back to her solitary cave, content knowing that the town she guarded in secret would be safe for another season.",
