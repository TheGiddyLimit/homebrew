She waves to them not in greeting, but in preparation for her victory - by the time her hand returns to her side, her prey has already been marked. As they meet and draw weapons, she begins her furious onslaught that astounds her opponent; making quick work of them, all that remains is a grisly spectacle.",

But they cannot do it forever; in a desperate act she marks her attacker with a tooth-shaped crest. At the last moment this act gives her the strength she needs to avoid a fireball that streaks past her.",
