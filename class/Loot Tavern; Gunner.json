							"entries": [
								"Heliana's Guide first introduced firearms as magitech weapons\u2014deadly combinations of magic and technology, expensive but worth every Copper Piece. In order to make more options available for Gunners without gating them behind a high price point, Zaman's Guide introduces blackpowder firearms. These versions work similarly to the ones in Heliana's Guide, with some slight balancing tweaks that allow them to exist at a lower cost, on par with other weapons in the game.",
								"The magitech firearms in Heliana's Guide are fully compatible with this class, but be aware that if your player characters have money to spend on them, they can represent a considerable increase in power. Blackpowder firearms are recommended for use with the Gunner class. "
