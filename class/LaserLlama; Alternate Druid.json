Rather, they organize in Circles, informal associations of Druids who safeguard sacred groves, or work to master specific traditions of primal magick. Not all Druids are aligned, and some Circles find their ideals in conflict."

Druids will unleash the fury of nature on any who attempt to exploit the wilds or upend the natural order of things. Some Druids are passive wardens, living deep in the wild places of the world, far from civilization. While others use their magic to bring the fight to civilization, anywhere it spreads.",

How Druids make use of this connection to nature can vary greatly. Most live in harmony with the wilds, only setting off on a life of adventure when their ecosystem is under threat. However, before settling in to this peaceful existence, many Druidic Circles require their initiates to venture out into the world to experience the wild variety and beauty of nature."
