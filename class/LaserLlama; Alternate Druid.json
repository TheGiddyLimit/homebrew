Muttering an incantation in the old tongue, a spirit appeared before her and took the shape of a massive panther. The hobgoblins would regret the day they had dared to harvest timber from this sage's forest.",
						"A feral elf got down on all fours, and as the yeti charged toward him, his body bent and changed. Where the slim elf had stood, now there was a massive brown bear, able to match the ferocious yeti in strength. After a brief but savage battle, the yeti lay dead, and a wild-eyed bear transformed back into an elf, but the elf's eyes burned with the ferocity of the great wild predator.",
						"The elder tortle closed his eyes and gave himself over to the colony of fungi which resided within his body. Instantly, he was covered in virulent growth and surrounded by a cloud of deadly spores. Knowing his time was short, the symbiotic being stepped forward to do battle with the horde of ghouls.",

Rather, they organize in Circles, informal associations of Druids who safeguard sacred groves, or work to master specific traditions of primal magick.

Druids will unleash the fury of nature on any who attempt to exploit the wilds or upend the natural order of things. Some Druids are passive wardens, living deep in the wild places of the world, far from civilization. While others use their magic to bring the fight to civilization, anywhere it spreads.",
								"All Druids have an affinity for animals, particularly beasts who make their home in the wilds. Likewise, these sages all have a deep knowledge of plants, weather, and the elements. How Druids make use of this connection to nature can vary greatly. Most live in harmony with the wilds, only setting off on a life of adventure when their ecosystem is under threat. However, before settling in to this peaceful existence, many Druidic Circles require their initiates to venture out into the world to experience the wild variety and beauty of nature."
