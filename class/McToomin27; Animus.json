It squeezes underneath the door to the library. The lights are out; the library empty. The mouse begins to grow, its features shifting. Quickly, it takes the form of a curious halfling. The halfling smiles, looking around at their treasure. The halfling chooses a tome on extinct creatures, and begins to read...",
						"An older elf sits on a log, unperturbed by the family of apes cavorting around them. The elf smiles wistfully, experiencing behavior and interactions that have never been documented before. They make sketches of the apes, noting their personalities, their likes and dislikes. Suddenly, one of the largest apes decides he doesn't like the elf's presence. He rushes over, puffing his chest out in intimidation. Never losing their smile, the elf concentrates for a moment, and shifts their form into that of a small, unthreatening ape child. The silverback, satisfied, walks away...",

The half-orc tells them to leave the village, and never return. The thugs look at one another, and then begin to laugh. In their revelry, they don't notice that the half-orc's skin has begun to turn into scales. Sharp teeth emerge from their gums; their head and jaws begin to grow. In no more than a moment, an extinct king of beasts stands before the interlopers. They hesitate briefly before screaming and running from the apparition, never to return...",
