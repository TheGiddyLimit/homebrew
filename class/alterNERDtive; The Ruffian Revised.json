The lot of the Ruffian is often a dark and meaningless one. Most have given up on writing their own story. Instead they serve corrupt leaders and get their hands dirty for other peoples' crimes."

One should not worry about a Ruffian that aggressively charges, for they are desperate. One should worry for the Ruffian patiently waiting, enduring hits and striking once their foes get tired.",

And someone who has survived as long as the Ruffians have certainly knows what to say ... and when."
