				"Beginning at 6th level, the soul binder can perform a special ritual to merge a magic item into its companion during a short rest. Merging with an item requires physical contact between the soul binder, the item and the companion. Certain items have prerequisites. The companion must meet any prerequisite for the item to successfully merge with it. Your companion cannot merge with items requiring a class prerequisite. If the short rest is interrupted, the merging fails. Otherwise, at the end of the short rest, the item merges into the companion.",
				"While merged, the companion gains an intuitive understanding of how to activate any magical properties of the item, including any necessary command words. Your companion can use the magical properties of the item and apply the effects to its natural weapons and natural armor, but doesn't get the benefit of the armor or weapon itself. It can only have one weapon merged at a time, and one piece of armor (shields count as armor for the purpose of this feature). The companion's natural weapons can only benefit from one of the merged items, and you can change this on a short rest, the same goes for its natural armor. If it absorbs a weapon, its attacks becomes magical.",
				"Example: if you bind a +1 Plate armor to your companion it gains +1 to its AC, but not the benefits of wearing Plate armor. Each merged item that requires attunement within the creature counts as an attunement for the soul binder. The soul binder can voluntarily end the merge by spending another short rest focused on the item, unless the item is cursed.",
