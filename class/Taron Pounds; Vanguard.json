As the moving bastion is pelted with a volley of arrows, he feels his shield make contact with something soft. He turns sharply into one of the cavern walls and slams it with full force. The sickening crunch of broken bones and dripping viscera from under the shield confirms his kill, and he turns his ire towards the remaining scouts.",
