						"A tattooed elf, veiled and cloaked, draws his obsidian dagger across the sand, calling forth from the lines a ghostly apparition to help him and his allies find their way. A trio of halfling hermits gather among candles and incense, chanting words of power to bait spirits from the shadows. The bejeweled human, dressed in exotic garb and golden chains bellows a spell which echoes with the voices of an army of lost souls, a fiendish glint in his eyes as blood drips from his palm.",
						"Unlike shamans who pray to the spirits of nature, witches trap the tormented souls of those lost betwixt the realm of the living and the beyond. As a witch, you learn to summon these souls and bind them to your will, gaining protection from them and power over them. As you attain higher levels, the covenant you choose to live by grants you further abilities which extend the utility and power of these bonds in different ways.",

Some witches tap into the residual energies of long-departed souls, while others use extant spiritual beings as conduits for their spellcasting. Either way and whether or not they wish, witches bind part of their own soul to those that surround them.",
								"Witch spells mostly deal with manipulation of spiritual energies (both living and dead) and protections against the beings who supply those energies. As part of their connection to the spiritual world, they are also privy to information and secrets normally not meant for mortal minds. As such, witches are powerful enchanters, abjurers, and diviners."

								"Witches acknowledge that there is a spiritual connection between all things\u2014forces that inexplicably and randomly bind beings and happenings together in a shared fate or destiny. They see other witches as brothers and sisters, and other classes as close cousins. As a consequence, witches are often fond of forming alliances. One kind of alliance is the circle that a witch belongs to.",
								"The covenant that a witch joins is the manifestation of a philosophy regarding the nature of spirits. Some, like the covenant of unity, believe in a supreme energy that extends beyond the physical world, weaving together magic and the collective conscience of all living things. Others, from the covenant of blood for example, believe in a more intimate connection between the physical world and the other side. In this philosophy, each soul is tied to something close to it in the physical world\u2014a body, an object, or location that was important to it when it was alive."

								"When deciding to play a witch, think about what led your character to tap into the spirit world. Maybe witchcraft is a tradition in the area, or your character comes from an area rife with a ghostly past. Superstition is also a good trigger for a fascination with spirits. What is your relationship with spirits? Is there a measure of mutual respect? Perhaps your character feels more like a servant to the spirit than the other way around, or maybe they possess the entitlement to dominate and extort spiritual beings.",

It could be that he or she was a pariah in their community due to contact with the other side, cast out and forced to fend for him or herself. Perhaps your character is even haunted by a particular spirit, and seeks away to control or be rid of it.",
