										"Sometimes an ability, feature, or spell allows you to add a bonus to an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, such as the bard's Bardic Inspiration, a war cleric's  Channel Divinity: Guided Strike, the *bless* spell, the martial technique boost offensive, and many others. Other abilities allow you to reroll the die for those die rolls, such as the drunken master monk's Drunkard's Luck. There is another type of abilities, much rarer than the others, ones that allow you to add special effects to your actions, reactions, die rolls, etc., such as the monk's Evasion ki feature. These abilities have in common the lack of key words for its trigger, such as hit, succeed, miss, or fail, which is why you can choose to use these after seeing the roll, but before the DM says wether the roll succeeds or fails."
