												"On the off chance a Luchadore is ever stripped of their mask, whether it be by a challenger or even his allies, they immediately become an ex-luchadore. You lose access to all Luchador moves and abilities aside from their Luchador unarmored movement, unarmored defense, Improved Combat Grappler and Unarmed Savant and become a Monk of equal level without access to a Monastic Tradition, access to Ki, or monk exclusive abilities."
