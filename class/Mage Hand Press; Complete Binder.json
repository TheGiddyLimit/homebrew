When she revealed her findings to her colleagues, they mocked her and decried her discovery, touting centuries old planar models instead.",

But in her last moments, she saw the curvature of space, saw it wrap around, and saw the hideous secrets behind it laid bare. And at last, she saw her place in it all. Then she met oblivion.",

Perhaps, this is her physical personage, which has persisted in the Void. No other creature, after all, has successfully traveled to that strange place, and it is unclear what truly remains of her body or soul."
