						"Clad in dark brown robes, a human unsheathes her sword and draws her hand back, whispering a quiet chant as undead creatures surround her. With a flick of her wrist, a bead of fire leaves her fingertips and streaks forward, erupting into a ball of fire once it reaches their ranks. As the flames disperse, she rushes into the fray with her blade, knocking aside the undead with deft strikes and precise blasts of water.",
						"Her long hair whipped by conjured wind, a gnome leaps into the air. Momentarily floating above the battlefield, she soon crashes down into a mass of kobolds. As she lands, her skin becomes stonelike and an earthen shield surrounds her.",
						"Crouching on a high tree branch, a high elf draws back his bow. Focusing his gaze on the sleeping hill giant below, he releases an arrow. The fiery streak whistles as it flies towards its target, finding its mark in the back of the giant's head.",
						"Planeshifters are masters of both arcane magic and the sword. Whatever their background, they are united by their study and mastery of the planes of existence. Drawing on the weaves of magic that permeate these planes, planeshifters cast spells of blazing fire, rushing wind, and even more powerful effects. Their traditions also stress the importance of physical strength and dexterity, as these traits are invaluable when traversing the highly varied and dangerous planar locations. Against some otherworldly creatures, an over-reliance on magic can spell a planeshifter's destruction.",

								"Alien and enigmatic, the otherworldly planes of existence draw the attention of many scholars and adventurers that seek to gain knowledge of their mysteries. The planes of existence teach of many things\u2014while planes such as Elysium and Arcadia focus on magic, planes like Ysgard and Acheron seek out only mighty warriors. The halls teach that a planeshifter must learn from and study all the various planes, even if they specialize in only a few of them. Most planeshifters initially study and attune themselves to the elemental planes\u2014the planes of fire, water, earth, and air, which allow them to learn elemental spells\u2014but later they attune themselves to some of the many outer planes.",
								"In order to harness planar magic, planeshifters must study the creatures of the planes they wish to attune to, and they also seek out and examine ancient relics and manuscripts that write of the planes of existence.",

Much like the schools of wizardry, the halls of the planeshifters act like universities, teaching students of the powers of the multiverse and allowing them to research, and sometimes travel to the different planes of existence. These halls are usually quite large, though very few of their students are ever able to gain even apprentice level mastery of the planes.",
								"Planeshifter halls, like the planes themselves, have a dualistic nature. Any one hall often teaches only two of the major traditions, and they emphasize the importance of balance in all things\u2014a planeshifter must learn of both the positive and negative planes, and they must balance their learning of both the martial and the arcane. A planeshifter that over-specializes is sure to find themselves unequipped to deal with the varied conditions of the planes.",
								"Planeshifters spend a lot of their time outside of the hall, however. The lure of knowledge or the rumors of an extraplanar object might call even prudent planeshifters to a life of adventure. If rumors of a particularly powerful or rare relic emerge, many planeshifters leave their halls on great adventures in their attempts to find it before others do."

Were you placed on a mission to recover a lost artifact or to seek out a an extraplanar being? Did you want to leave, or did you feel like you were pressured or even forced to go?
