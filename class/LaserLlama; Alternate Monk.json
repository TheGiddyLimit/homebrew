						"The young man took a deep breath and steadied himself as the ogre charged him. Thinking back to his training he prepared to counter the incoming blow. As the ogre's club struck the dirt where he had been only moments before, the young man drew upon his reservoir of spiritual power and let fly a flurry of blows upon the unsuspecting beast. Before the hulking ogre realized what had happened, it lay stunned in the mud. Hopefully, when the ogre regained consciousness it would think twice before raiding the local homesteads.",

Trained in Martial Arts from birth, the lethal warriors slew the enemy guards without a sound. As the general stirred from sleep, his eyed widened as the hobgoblins seemed to appear from the darkness itself. He tried to call for help, but no sound came from his mouth as his life was ruthlessly snuffed out by the assassins. As quietly as they had arrived, the dark hobgoblin assassins disappeared into the night.",

Though she was the most powerful living Wu Jen master, even in her prime she could not hope to slay half this many foes. She dropped her cloak from her shoulders, and her tattoos glistened with elemental magic as she prepared to bring down the mountain itself down upon her. Though she would most certainly perish, the pass would be blocked, and most importantly, her students would be able to escape.",
