						"The {@i {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}} contains a variant rule for {@variantrule spell points}, an alternative to spell slots that draws your magical power from a pool rather than using slots to cast spells. This rule is controversial for most spellcasters, as it grants a large pool of low level spells without much justification. Sorcerers, however, have the Font of Magic feature, which allows them to interchange spell slots and sorcery points. This creates a dynamic that closely emulates spell points without actually using them.",
						"Using this concept as a baseline, I've created a variant of the sorcerer which has a modified version of the spell points rule and adds some new features.

To this end, I've modified the Font of Magic feature to allow short bursts of powerful casting, and I've given each origin an additional known spell of levels 1-5. For the remaining Metamagic, I've given new options, more frequent and consistent intervals at which the sorcerer learns metamagic, and allowed you to swap metamagic choices when you gain a new one."
