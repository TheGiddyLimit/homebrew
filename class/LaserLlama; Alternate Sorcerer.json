						"The pale half-elf muttered an incantation under his breath, and his shadow came alive, taking the form of a massive wolf. The shadow beast pounced on the foolish bandit that had dared attack him, and pinned him to the ground. The pallid sorcerer spoke another incantation, and orbs of pulsing arcane acid formed in his hands. The bandit let out a piercing cry, filled with regret, as he struggled in vain to break free from the sorcerer's living shadow. The scream would be his last, as a wave of magically conjured acid dissolved his flesh and bones to ooze.",
						"As the grass and trees smoldered from the great dragon's fiery blast, the smoke cleared to reveal a young human man. His clothes had been scorched away to reveal patches of golden scales across his body. His eyes flashed bright with a glint of gold and white jets of flame burst forth from his fingertips. The wyrm reeled from the unexpected impact, and as it fell from the sky, the scaled beast wondered how this pathetic mortal had come to wield power that rivaled that of a true dragon.",
						"The young halfling girl ducked into an alleyway and tucked the stolen loaf of bread under her cloak. The market she had just come from had broken out into chaos. She had attempted a simple enchantment, just enough to convince a baker to give her a loaf for free, but her magic had other plans. As she whispered her spell, a crack like a bolt of lightning could be heard throughout the market, and instantly all the produce in the market square had spoiled. As she ducked into a nearby alley, she cursed the wild power that caused her to be abandoned by her family.",
