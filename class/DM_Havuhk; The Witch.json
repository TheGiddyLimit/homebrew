Alternatively, you can state a destination, and the house will begin moving towards that destination without you needing to constantly tell it where to move, as long as you know where the destination is. Additionally, you can use an action to call the house to you, as long as it is on the same plane of existence as you. The house immediately sprouts legs if it hasn't already, and begins move directly towards you as quickly as it can. The house takes the most direct route possible, but will not move through areas that will harm it, such as running off a cliff or through lava, unless you command it to.",

The house must have a door, four walls, one floor, and a roof to be considered a house. When you do so, the house gains the same properties as the hut for the duration of this spell.
