										"While you are perfectly capable of applying makeup to others (and many of your spells involve you doing so), your favoured face effects apply only to you. Only you can benefit from your face.",
										"Applying new makeup as part of a spell or class feature does not remove your favoured face. Only painting a new favoured face or explicitly removing your makeup cancels these abilities.",
										"This is not the class to be overly concerned with your damage output. Spells like vampiric touch and your poison ivy favoured face option provide you with a reliable (if low) source of damage, but expecting to match a sorcerer twinning disintegrate or a paladin stacking smites is misconstruing the intention of the rouge class, which is meant to be a social/utility controller. It's okay to rely on your teammates for damage when you excel in other areas.",
										"Many of your class features (and even two of your cantrips, based on your specialisation) only function while you are wearing makeup. Your DM may rule that certain situations, like taking a long rest, taking a bath, or being whelmed by a water weird, remove your makeup. Don't argue with your DM; simply take the next opportunity to spend ten minutes reapplying it. If you feel your DM is being too punishing, talk to them out of the context of the game. Just like the rogue's sneak attack, you are assumed to have these options always available to you to balance out with other classes, and removing your makeup is like taking away a fighter's weapons and armor. It's not that it can't be done, it's that overdoing it is potentially against the spirit of the game.",
										"Most importantly, just like with bards and enchanters, your offensive abilities are best used against NPCs, not against members of your own party (and even against NPCs, only with the explicit cooperation of your DM). Always obey the social contract of your table and consider your friends to be real flesh and blood human beings before they've taken on the role of characters in your imagination. If someone is uncomfortable with you casting charm person on their character, for example, the correct course of action is to stop and reestablish boundaries. You are winning the game when the whole table has fun, not just you."
