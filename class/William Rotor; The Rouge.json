Your DM may rule that certain situations, like taking a long rest, taking a bath, or being whelmed by a {@creature water weird} remove your makeup. Don't argue with your DM; simply take the next opportunity to spend a minute reapplying it. If you feel your DM is being too punishing, explain out of character that you are assumed to have these options always available to you, and removing your makeup is like taking away a fighter's weapons and armor. It's not that it can't be done, it's that overdoing it is potentially against the spirit of the game.",

You are winning the game when the whole table has fun, not just you."
