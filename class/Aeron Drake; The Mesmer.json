Even though mesmers can do that kind of tricks, they are more powerful than just a local magician, and only a few knows or have seen the true power of mesmers. They use the energy surrounding every living entity and canalizes it to cast powerful spells, create illusions, and striking the mind. They are constantly storing energy and releasing it with each spell they cast, maintaining the balance between the living creatures around them, unless they decide to destroy the energy from a particular foe, causing devastating mind strikes, and in some cases, draining its energy.",
