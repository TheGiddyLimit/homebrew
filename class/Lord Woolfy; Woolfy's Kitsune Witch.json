            "A Kitsune Witch is a person who has formed a magical bond with a fox-like creature. Unlike normal foxes, this creature is innately magical. Often the fox has two or more tails when found. Together with this kitsune companion the person develops magic, which will enhance them in combat and other situations.",
            "Kitsune Witches often form this bond with a kitsune they find in trouble. After they help out the kitsune, they will become very loyal to the Witch, often following them home. Even if the Witch is reluctant at first, the kitsune will persist for weeks to thank its saviour, by becoming their best friend.",
            "Kitsune Witches tend to take up the characteristics of their kitsune companion and vice versa. Some will delight in trickery, while others primarily focus on helping their fellow man out. No matter the way they interact with society, a Kitsune Witch will never do it alone."
