This magic may have been influenced by some force such as the divine powers of a god of commerce, greed, luck, or wealth, or the intrinsic nature of trade, chance, and chaos.",

The gods of commerce garnered worship, {@deity Waukeen|Faerûnian|SCAG} being the most widely worshiped of these gods in the Forgotten Realms. In some urban areas, worship of gods presiding in the domain of fertility and nature have been abandoned due to them feeling unnecessary when trade will provide."
