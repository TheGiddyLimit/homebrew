Members of this coven like to paint themselves as misunderstood victims, but it's not tragedy that turns a witch's heart to darkness\u2014it's the inability to let go of how they've been wronged, an aggrieved fixation on using witchcraft to punish transgressors rather than to redress trespasses.",
				"The Coven of the Wicked is an optional ruleset that demonstrates how witches sometimes slide into wickedness. Like a paladin who breaks their oath, it's largely a tool for developing villainous NPCs, and a player who wishes to play a member of this coven should have a discussion with the GM about whether or not it's narratively appropriate to begin changing their coven or even to start a campaign as a witch who's already fallen.",
				"Similarly, if a Witch player character seems to be developing tendencies towards wickedness, the GM might have a conversation with the player about whether or not they're turning wicked, as below. In general, exploring the Coven of the Wicked makes the most sense in a long-term campaign with complex moral themes, where arcs of wickedness and redemption have time to arise organically and come to a satisfying conclusion.",

The tocsin can be hung from a stable hook, branch, or peg with an action. Once it's set up, if a spell such as {@spell Scrying} or {@spell Clairvoyance} creates a sensor within 60 feet of the tocsin, it chimes, rings, squawks, or toots an alarm. The tocsin itself can't be seen or heard through such sensors.",
				"Additionally, while a sensor remains open within range of the tocsin, the image of the spell's caster is visible as a dim reflection on the tocsin's surface."

				"Often a smooth, polished stone small enough to fit in one's pocket, these talismans may also take the form of small toys, beaded bracelets, or rings a half-size too loose. When you rub, fidget, or fiddle with this talisman for one minute during a {@variantrule Short Rest|XPHB|Short} or {@variantrule Long Rest|XPHB}, you can reroll an Intelligence check or a Wisdom ({@skill Insight|XPHB}) check that you made since the end of your last {@variantrule Short Rest|XPHB|Short} or {@variantrule Long Rest|XPHB}, even if the subject of the check is no longer at hand, and add {@dice 1d4} to the total. A given check can only be rerolled with the {@i Worry Stone} once."
