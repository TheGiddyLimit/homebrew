His opponent's sword flares with blue light an instant before she sends lightning flashing forth to smite him.",

Questing knights, conquering overlords, royal champions, elite foot soldiers, hardened mercenaries, and bandit kings\u2014as fighters, they all share an unparalleled mastery with weapons and armor, and a thorough knowledge of the skills of combat.

Every fighter can swing an axe, fence with a rapier, wield a longsword or a greatsword, use a bow, and even trap foes in a net with some degree of skill. Likewise, a fighter is adept with shields and every form of armor. Beyond that basic degree of familiarity, each fighter specializes in a certain style of combat. Some concentrate on archery, some on fighting with two weapons at once, and some on augmenting their martial skills with magic. This combination of broad general ability and extensive specialization makes fighters superior combatants on battlefields and in dungeons alike."

The dungeon delving, monster slaying, and other dangerous work common among adventurers is second nature for a fighter, not all that different from the life he or she left behind.
