						"As the elderly human watched his apprentice struggle to lift the pebble with his mind, he thought back to his youth, and the years of training it had taken to unlock his own psionic gift. After traveling the world he had realized that true enlightenment was only found within, and he retreated to the cave he called home. As his remaining years had grown fewer in number, he had taken the young lad who now stood before him as an apprentice to pass on all he had learned.",
						"Selected at birth due to her psionic potential, the young elf had been molded into the perfect assassin. As held her latest mark firmly beneath her, the baron let out a soft cry as a blade of pure psionic energy pierced his heart. The next morning, the baron's guards would find him dead, though the cause of his untimely demise would forever remain a mystery.",
						"The young dwarf fled into the forest, consumed with the terror of what he'd done. For as long as he could remember, there was {@i something} within his mind that h struggled to keep bottled up. That morning, in a moment of weakness, his focus slipped, and a torrent of wild psionic power erupted from within him. He had awoken in the rubble of his home to find his family buried in the ruins. Deep down, he had always known this power would break free. He would live his life as a hermit in the wild where he couldn't harm anyone else.",

								"Whether through years of practice, or a once in a generation innate talent, Psions learn to manipulate the world with the wondrous power of their minds. Drawing upon the mystical power within, they can communicate without speaking, move objects, alter their physical bodies, and even manifest spells. Relying solely on mastery of their mind, Psions can perform feats thought impossible, even by the most erudite Wizards and devout Clerics. For Psions, it is a point of great pride that they can produce wonders without the help of external power.",
								"Due to their potential, Psions are often misunderstood and feared by the common folk. If they don't learn to control their power, their strange abilities can cause them to be shunned and hated by those around them. Most Psions reveal their power only when necessary, and are hesitant to trust others."

Others are trained to use their mystic abilities to morph their bodies into deadly weapons. And for the rare few who are never discovered by a master, or attempt to stifle their power, they risk outbursts of wild psionic energy that can have devastating effects."
