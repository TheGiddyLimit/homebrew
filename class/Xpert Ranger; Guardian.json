						"A stoic dwarf in full plate stands tall amidst a flaming inferno as he stares down a red dragon many times his size. He takes a steadying breath and raises his shield, preparing for yet another onslaught of whirling claws and gnashing teeth.",
						"From the back of a rowdy tavern, a smug-looking human in worn-down chain mail hurls insults back and forth with a group of grizzled miners, eventually finding himself battered, bruised, and banned from yet another local tavern.",
						"Swarmed by a writhing horde of undead, an elf in gleaming white armor coats her blade with the ichor of one approaching monstrosity after another, all while keeping the frightened young tiefling wrapped around her ankle safe and secure.",
						"When the situation is at its most dire, there is no one better to have at your side than a guardian. These stalwart warriors use their inciting taunts and impregnable defenses to become a living wall between their allies and certain doom. Whether a guardian is a valiant knight, silver-tongued sellsword, or stubborn general, they all excel at guiding their comrades through the most hopeless of circumstances and emerging victorious on the other side.",

								"At their core, guardians don't differ much from other physical combatants in the world of Dungeons and Dragons. Using their martial prowess to overcome a foe is nothing new to a guardian. However, unlike their martial cousins who prefer to swing at an enemy until it falls, guardians take a more defensive approach to dealing with threats. Blocks or parries take precedence over swings or thrusts, and a sturdy guard is a key tool in any guardian's toolkit.",
								"While all guardians share a defense that rivals the greatest knights of the realms, they differ in their methods of defending. Some guardians simply defend themselves with a shield, some augment their defenses with magic, and some use cunning words to defend themselves on the social battlefield. However they choose to defend themselves, you can be sure that cracking the defense of a guardian is no easy feat."

								"Though they serve their purpose, a shields or weapons aren't the only tools that a guardian carries into battle. Alongside the equipment that can be seen upon their backs, each guardian carries themselves with a powerful demeanor that both allies and enemies alike can feel with just a glance.",
								"In combat, guardians use this palpable social aura along with taunting words or threatening actions to draw the anger and hostility out of their enemies. Though they might not enjoy taking the beating that follows, a guardian will wear the battle scars proudly, knowing that each one could have instead been worn by a valued comrade."

								"As you create your guardian character, think about why, or if, your character chooses to protect others. What led you to hone your defenses to the point that they became your weapon? Is there a certain group that trained you to protect others, or perhaps a group that you were trained to protect? A wise and caring mentor, the unique skills and weapons of your homeland, or a former ward or occupation could all have been factors.",
								"You might have failed to protect a loved one and vowed to never let it happen again. Perhaps you were saved by a legendary guardian and aspire to become like them. You could have been trained by the city watch to defend the public from those that would endanger them. Maybe you simply excelled at defending to the point that it became your style of fighting. Whatever your reason for becoming a guardian, your indomitable will and your armor now stand as a towering shield defending yourself and your allies."
