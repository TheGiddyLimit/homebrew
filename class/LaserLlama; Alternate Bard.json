With the eyes of all his foes on him, he began to play a masterful song ridiculing the frost giant lord. As the multitude of foes closed around on him, the elderly musician's heroic companions jumped from the battlements, and motivated by the wondrous song, they made quick work of the giant and his horde.",

Not to be outdone, and inspired by the bravery of the halfling in her shining armor, the heroes drew their weapons and ran forward. When the battle was won, the valiant halfling sat down to write a ballad of the heroics of the day.",

For uncounted years, this town had been living under the brutal rule of an evil vampire lord. After many hopeless years, the tales told by this strangely beautiful man had given the townsfolk hope that together they could overthrow their undead overlord.",

								"While not all Bards are wandering musicians, they each learn to draw upon the song of creation in their own unique way. Whether through their speech, songs, or art, all Bards recognize the magical power of spoken words.

They often find themselves in the company of heroes delving into forgotten tombs, deciphering ancient scrolls, and on the hunt for strange exotic creatures. Any Bard that can tell an awe-inspiring story from personal experience earns renown among other Bards.
