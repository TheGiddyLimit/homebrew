								"Druid is already a full caster that expects you to learn the casting system and druid spells, it shouldn't have a second workload of looking up and learning how beast statblocks work.",
								"This core feature of the class is now pegged to Monster Design, which does not, and shouldn't, follow the same rules as PC Design. This stifles the design both for the Druid and for Beasts in the system.",
								"New books, sometimes adventure modules, with new beasts come out and suddenly your druid is stronger or more versatile? You end up referencing more books than a Wizard!"
							]
						},
						"The core of Elegant Druid is the new Wild Shape mechanics, which use an internal, level-scaling statblock for any beast you turn into, that you then add-on an appropiate Aspect to customize into a wolf or an elk or a bear or what have you. This has a number of beneficial effects:",

							"items": [
								"You can now turn into anything you want, at any level, and you will have level-appropiate stats.",
								"You no longer have to look up and learn statblocks in another section or in another book, everything is there in the feature.",
								"The split of Scout Form and Combat Form codifies the way that Wild Shape gets used in gameplay, and gives you more freedom to use wild shape for utility without giving up its combat potential.",
								"Reflavoring and customization are now built-in assumptions rather than something you're left to figure out on your own.",
								"The design is much more flexible, since the Druidic Forms and Aspects can just be tuned directly, instead of being at the mercy of how statblocks are written. Subclasses also have a much easier job of hooking into your core defining class feature."

						"I also have always felt that that Moon/Land split made for something of an unsatisfying dichotomy within the class. Elegant Druid's Combat Form statblock is designed to be somewhere between the default and PHB Moon Druid's scaling, which should make it useful for all druids regardless of subclass. Moon Druid is the still the master of the Combat Form but you are not forced to pick it in order to have reasonable combat stats. Land Druid has been overhauled and given much more appealing features, as well as the defining ability to cast their circle spells even while in wild shape.",
