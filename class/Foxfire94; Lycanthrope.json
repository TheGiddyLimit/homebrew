However, not all lycanthropes are evil beasts enslaved to their vicious nature. Those who take their time to train themselves and focus their minds can unlock their bestial power and use it for their own desires. Able to shift into animalistic hybrids and shrug off wounds that would fell mortal men, lycanthropes that follow this path become the ultimate predators.
