						"A cloaked man sits in a seedy tavern, a billow of smoke pouring from the folds of his robe, his booted feet rested upon a chairacross from him. A fair maiden enter the room. Immediately, he tosses his hood back, and kicks the chair out from his table. He invites her to sit, gesturing to the seat before beginning to lightly shuffle a deck of cards. He draws three, and places them on the table. She nods, and immediately moves to sit with him. ",
						"A party of adventurers stand at the feet of a mighty slain dragon. It was a hard fought battle, and even harder won. They look to their leader, who also lay fallen, gasping ragged breaths. A woman in loose robes approaches him, kneeling quietly and smiling. Wordlessly, she pulls a playing card out of her sleeve and presses it against the fallen warrior. His vitality returns, and the group breathes a sigh of relief. ",
						"A slight, older man sits in an ornate chair to the side of a great king. The kingdom has fallen into chaos, and there is talk of rebellion. The king turns to his advisor and asks how he can stop this problem before it gets worse. The old man smiles, adjusts his glasses, and pulls out a deck of cards. He begins laying them on a table in an indecipherable pattern. Finally, he places a single card into the middle of the pattern. He hesitates for just a moment before drawing the card. He smiles, and convinces the king that his rule can be assured. ",
						"Tarocchi are mysterious wielders of magic, not using simple wands or staves, but drawing power from decks of cards. The luck of the draw, and the irony of not having a card you need, is never lost on a tarocchi, who is able to see the long term goal, and make use of what hand of cards they are dealt, both from their power packs, and from life itself.

								"Often, however, these decks simply appear as ordinary playing cards, allowing a tarocchi to feign innocence of their magical abilities. Indeed, power packs can be used as an ordinary deck of cards, and even if the cards are lost or destroyed, they will reform in the tarocchi's pack by the light of the next morning, as arcane magic binds the two together.

The unreliability of their powers make others reluctant to employ them, or to rely on them. For this reason, tarocchi often regard their magical abilities as a sort of hobby, one which they must practice and hone in their free time, while finding work elsewhere.",
								"The exception to this are tarocchi who are charismatic enough to find themselves in the employ of a thieves' guild, and who can convince the criminals with which they would work that their skills are valuable and reliable, so long as everyone else can be flexible.

Did you purchase them from a mysterious merchant, whom no one else remembers? ",

Do you have an ancestral bloodline of magic users, whose arcane abilities have been born in you? Have you bonded with an otherworldly being, granting you powerful magic abilities? Or did you find your deck of cards and determine to learn more, poring over and studying ancienct texts to determine the true power of the cards?"
