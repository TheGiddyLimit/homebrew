								"One of the first things an alchemist learns is how to mix chemicals that react explosively with each other. Ostensibly, this is taught to students to prevent deadly accidents, but adventuring alchemists often utilize this knowledge to create bombs to use in combat and exploration.",
								"An alchemical bomb is a 1-pound, apple-sized, spherical glass or clay flask filled with a reactive chemical. A smaller vial of thin glass containing a reagent is suspended in the liquid, and the whole thing is sealed with a cork or wax seal. The chemicals violently explode when mixed. This occurs when the inner vial breaks, usually after the bomb impacts a solid surface or a fuse sets off a small explosive detonator within the vial. Bombs are primarily used to fend off enemies, but creative alchemists may find more practical uses for explosives, such as demolishing obstacles.",
								"More experienced alchemists learn to mix less volatile substances, some of which can replicate magical effects. Many become apothecaries, healing and creating potions for others. Apothecaries can use herbs and chemicals to heal wounds, cure diseases, and neutralize poison."

It is no surprise, then, that alchemists strive to tap deeper into that power, researching and discovering new compounds composed of the elements. The pinnacle of alchemy is the philosopher's stone, which is rumored to grant its bearer supreme elemental power. Few alchemists have succeeded in creating a philosopher's stone, and fewer still remain alive to divulge its secrets."

Are you searching for new alchemical formulae, or rare ingredients? Do you, like so many, seek the philosopher's stone?",
