If a warrior from the town could best him in single combat, his gang of bandits would leave peacefully.

To the surprise of the townsfolk, he drew his sword, muttered a prayer, and stepped forward to defend his home.",

However, if her group of elite soldiers followed her orders to the letter, they had a chance to cut off the head of the army before it came to battle. For what could be her final mission, she gripped her battleaxe and gave the order to move out.",
