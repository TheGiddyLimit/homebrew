The first is utilizing the arcane energy that lies within oneself \u2014 the Black, though even just a spark of that is enough. Because with learned control they supplement it with the second: Nature's magic \u2014 the White, which is divine in essence. This blend of both arcane and divine is what makes up red magic. With experience, a red mage can further mix their magic with the Aether to create an even more powerful magic matrix."
