The healer must then cast {@spell lesser restoration} in order to cleanse the disease from the victim's blood, and then cast {@spell remove curse} in order to finally dispel the curse. Provided that the victim stood perfectly still during that whole process and the atonement spell took hold, then the lycanthropic curse will have finally been removed."
