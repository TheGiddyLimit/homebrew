To craft it, you must have an unexpended spell slot of a high enough level to cast the spell (you need not have the spell prepared) and you must succeed on a Wisdom check using artisan's tools with a DC of 10 + the spell's level. On a failure, the item isn't created; if the check fails by 5 or more, you also expend a spell slot of the spell's level. You can attempt to make a single token during a short or long rest.

Some witches guard their talismans jealously, but others craft them specifically for heroes, loved ones, or younger witches under their tutelage.",
