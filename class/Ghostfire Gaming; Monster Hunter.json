He makes his way with an exhausted calm, a hooked scythe in one hand and a beast's severed head in the other. Gathering villagers look to the head still dripping with gore, then to the half-orc, his gaze emotionless and his expectations clear. Townsfolk scamper to scrape together their promised reward to the monster killer, as they understand this is someone who handles bad faith poorly.",
						"When city folk are laid to rest within the mausoleum, they most often stay there. On this day, however, the dead lazily roam the halls searching for a way out. A skeleton sheathed in tattered skin shatters with a thunderous boom upon shambling over an explosive trap. The sound attracts more rasping zombies, the halfling who set the trap taking careful aim with her crossbow as they wander into her line of fire.",
						"A master and apprentice recite an old chant passed down from their guild as a crowd of royal servants look on warily. The servants' lord had long feared rumors of a monster living within the castle walls. In their desperation, the lord chose to rely on the chanting pair. Their trust was not in vain, as when the arcanists' scatter a fistful of shining dust into the royal chamber, one of the maids' shrieks, twists, and contorts into her true form.",
						"Monster Hunters, as their title suggests, spend their lives hunting and killing all manner of abhorrent creatures. But the stories and legends about these travelers tend to be exaggerated, often suggesting that they are noble knights-errant in search of townships to rescue from local fiends. Other tales tell of sinister loners that cause more problems than they solve, cavorting with the creatures they claim to kill and leaving behind hellish offspring. The truth is far more mundane than common folk are willing to take interest in, as most monster hunters are simply professionals looking for work.",

								"Each monster hunter specializes in identifying, seeking, and killing different types of creatures. Therefore, each monster hunter also specializes in different methods for doing so. While some hunters don heavy armor and carry shields to protect against crushing jaws and scything claws, others prefer to remain light and agile to keep distance between themselves and their quarry.",
								"Each guild of hunters operates under their own professional code, and each hunter their own moral compass. Most guilds refuse coin for killing common folk.

A monster hunter knows that bravado and a strong sword arm are often not enough to survive their preternatural prey. Therefore, they spend years studying alongside their physical training. Such is their learning that a monster hunter could identify a wraith from a specter or differentiate the tracks of a griffin from a manticore."

								"As you create your monster hunter, there are two main questions to consider.",
								"The first is the nature of your monster hunter training and education. Were you disciplined in a guildhall where the techniques of your trade are the closely guarded secret of your tutors? Or were you mentored on the road by a hunter who took you in?",
								"As a starting character, you'll choose two monster types that you specialize in hunting. When you reach higher levels, you will also choose a hunting guild which represents the maturing of your knowledge and therefore could reflect the nature of your early education.",
								"Think about why you specialize in hunting certain monster types. Are they the same types of monsters your mentor or guild specialized in? Or did your research branch into other creature types due to special interest? Did your mentor raise you as part of the carver guild, specialized in close quarters fighting against dangerous monstrosities? Or did they tutor you in creating traps and equipment from dragon bones? It also is possible your early training provided you with a broad education or that you are self-taught, only choosing to specialize in later life.",
								"The second question to consider is your motivation for being a monster hunter. Is it purely a professional endeavor for which you expect to be well compensated? Or are you trying to make the world safer one monster at a time?",
								"Your motivations may be complex and even a source of internal conflict. Perhaps it pains you to slay such rare and misunderstood creatures, but you've learned no other way to provide for yourself? Or your guild code forces you to take payment for each beast killed, despite feeling like you're taking advantage of poor villagers far too often? Perhaps you simply enjoy the challenge of the hunt and the adrenaline you get when a beast lunges?",
								"Your motivations may tie back into the monsters you specialize in. For example, you may be seeking revenge against the types of creatures that destroyed your home or took your mentor away. There may even be beasts you refuse to hunt, or beasts you refuse to take payment for. This could include a conscientious objection to slaying sentient creatures defending their territories from human expansion. Or maybe you so detest the creatures you specialize in hunting that you will gladly seek them out and destroy them with or without compensation.",

										"Second, choose a background that reflects your training and the monsters you specialize in hunting, or alternatively your background could reflect your character's life before they fell into the monster hunting profession.",
										"If you are using advanced backgrounds from Grim Hollow: The Campaign Guide, the Beast Hunter profession from the {@background Outlander|GHPG} background is perfect for any lifelong monster hunter characters."

								"I didn't know such things were possible before I met with Stelvi. Before we hunted alongside one another.",
								"We were hired to kill a pack of beasts. They'd been mauling caravans and leaving the farmland empty. The lord who owned the land was concerned his stores would be empty if the crop couldn't be harvested in time. The fool was more concerned about replenishing his tax reserves than preserving the lives of those he ruled. It meant he was willing to pay a high price to have the monsters slain \u2013 so much so he hired two of us rather than bothering to have us bid on the contract.",
								"We found the monsters' tracks amidst the aftermath of one of their ambushes. Their prints were unusual for a monstrosity. The scattered way they left the destroyed caravan suggested they weren't particularly intelligent. But their prints were no griffins or basilisks that I recognized. It was Stelvi who pointed out they weren't monstrosities at all. We were hunting a pack of fiends.",
								"We rode the woodland paths three evenings before we were set upon by the creatures, ourselves. Six exploded from the underbrush as if birthed from the hells deep beneath the earth. They appeared as great lizards with dark, scaly spines.",
								"We were far from where we'd set our own trap, but none save the largest among them were a match for the speed of our horses. Thankfully, for the monsters provided a fierce pursuit.",
								"We lead them to the place where we wanted them. The weretraps I buried exploded and caught the largest by surprise. When I dismounted, I shot it with my crossbow and anchored it to the ground. Six seconds later the others were upon us.",
								"I thought Stelvi was odd as soon as I met her. I remember her intense stare and amber eyes, yet the next day and since, they had been green. She maintained strange habits such as eating very little and never sharing a meal. She seemed concerningly under equipped for our profession, carrying naught but an unremarkable longsword and patchwork armor that fitted her poorly.",
								"Despite this I chose to trust her. Worst case, she'd provide valuable seconds getting between me and a grasping claw.",
								"As we rode in flight from the creatures, I watched her slather her mouth with a dark ooze that blistered her lips and blackened her teeth. While I restrained the largest monster, she spat on her sword and wiped the oily goo along the edge. When the first creature confronted her, she cut it open with an up-thrust and its insides sizzled and dissolved.",
								"Two fell upon my horse and began to devour it. A third ran at me and I shot at its eye, but its jaws closed around my shoulder. I felt pain. Then I felt my body begin to lock up. A numbness spread from the wound. I'd have died in that moment save for the creature trying to pin me down beneath its claw. My push plate burst on my chest and forced me to stagger away.",
								"As I caught my breath, the creature dashed towards me again. I breathed in. I waited. I saw the veins in its milky white eye. I fired my crossbow and, with a single bolt, the creature collapsed dead at my feet.",
								"My horse was shrieking. When I looked back, the two creatures were gulping down chunks of stone. My steed had been transformed into a statue. I stretched my stiffened shoulder with concern.",
								"Stelvi had killed a second of the monsters. She moved with a preternatural agility. Her eyes flashed amber once more, as if she had become possessed.",
								"Together we slew the two that had eaten my horse. They had become slow from their meal. I was almost casual with my crossbow. Then I heard the ropes that had restrained the largest snap and we encircled it like two wolves around a bear.",
								"The monster's tail lashed out and Stelvi's horse whinnied as it fell on its side. Its guts spilled onto the road.",
								"Stelvi slashed at the monster's face. I buried bolts in its hind. Then the creature turned in frustration and the dance reversed.",
								"The wounds it was dealt by the other hunter hissed and burned. Black ooze dripped from her bottom lip. I could see her own injuries ooze black instead of red. And the realization sunk in. Stelvi was not entirely human herself.",
								"When the final lupilisk was dead \u2013 their name learned from my hunting partner \u2013 Stelvi walked to her dying horse. She ended the animal's misery with her sword. As I collected the scales and fangs from our prey, I watched her from the corner of my eye.",
								"Stelvi knelt in the horse's spilled offal. I thought she might be salvaging its heart or bones. Instead, she lifted its remains to her mouth devoured its innards. And as she did her wounds stopped bleeding and her bruises lost their dark color.",
								"She caught me staring at her. I asked if she was human. She asked if she needed to be worried.",
								"I was still holding my carving knife. She gripped the hilt of her sword."

								"My suspicion was that the witch could hear me, so I spoke. Stelvi turned her head to me sharply.",
								"\"Lady of the autumn court,\" I chose flattery, \"We have travelled far for stories of your beauty. We are humble pilgrims come to see the world's natural wonders. When we were told of you, we swore an oath to search until we found you, even if we shall die in these woods.\"",

								"\"We have no coin for engraved armor or mighty arms,\" I claimed, \"our kingdom is the road and our court the forest.\"",
								"\"I suspect you are paid in plenty,\" she emerged from behind a tree.",
								"She had the stature of a young woman in a tattered farm dress. Her feet were dusted with mud and her hair was tangled with leaves. At first glance, a commoner might assume she was lost in the woods. But this body did not belong to her, and the years had begun to show it.",
								"Her skin was stained with red blotches like birthmarks. Where the marks were darkest the skin had begun to peel away. Her nails were sharp and bloodied, as if they had pierced out the ends of her fingers. Though she still wore a human face, her eyes were entirely red with slitted pupils. She was a creature failing to hide herself with a mask.",
								"Stelvi drew her longsword.",
								"\"Your stomach's rumbling,\" I muttered to the hunter.",
								"\"How much is my life worth?\" the witch asked.",
								"\"Quite a lot, actually,\" I admitted. \"You blighted a wealthy man. He'll settle for nothing less than your head, though I suspect that one's not yours.\"",
								"Stelvi sniffed the air, observing the creature.",
								"\"She was part of my family,\" the red women looked at her hand. \"I was once part of a very large one, and thanks to your ilk she was one of the last.\"",
								"\"Our ilk don't tend towards mutual understanding,\" I pointed between us.",
								"\"The wealthy man sent hounds and soldiers into my woods,\" the witch lamented. \"When the trees wouldn't allow me to be caught, he tried burning them down. The forest was scarred. All because a mortal fears what he can't control.\"",
								"I wouldn't have thought myself the kind to shed a tear because of a forest fire. Or maybe it was Stelvi coiling to attack while the red woman was speaking that bothered me. Still, I considered that I was paid often to defend a village from encroaching monsters. How was defending a forest from encroaching men any different?",
								"Stelvi lunged. Her sword gashed the red woman's arm. The woman screamed and stumbled. As she tried to scramble backwards over the tree roots, she pleaded for my aid.",
								"\"Stop her from killing me!\"",
								"I decided to act. I threw a weretrap which exploded off Stelvi's back with a whip-crack and knocked the hunter prone. The witch fled through the trees. Stelvi staggered to her feet. Blood stained the soil beneath her. The weretrap had opened a wound across her shoulder.",
								"\"What are you doing?\" Stelvi shouted.",
								"I held my short sword ready.",
								"Stelvi tried to dart in the direction the red woman ran. I interposed myself and Stelvi leaped upon a tree. She began to climb upwards, sinking her claw-like nails into the bark. I reached for my crossbow. When the bolt pierced Stelvi's thigh it was trailed by long cord, which I yanked and pulled the hunter back to the forest floor.",
								"The red woman was gone.",
								"\"You moron,\" Stelvi shouted as she rolled to her feet. She tore the bolt from her leg and looked ready to lunge. Instead, she composed herself and sheathed her weapon. Her wounds were already closing miraculously.",

								"Some years later I found myself back in that forest, alone.",

								"She looked different than she had before, her humanoid disguise long deteriorated. Her entire complexion was brighter than blood. Gnarled hands like spidery claws were fixed to arms that were far too long and thin for her body. Her hair was a mess of red. Her face was near featureless except for her dark slitted eyes, and a crooked jaw behind a gaping lipless mouth.",
								"\"What would you possibly have of interest to me,\" she muttered before tasting her stew.",
								"I unhooked the head of the wealthy man from my belt. The same man that had offered payment for her life those years ago. It landed near her pot, scowling upwards. It was difficult to imagine that face had once been human. His teeth had grown into crooked fangs and his skin was so festered with bile it smelled of decay when he had been alive.",
								"\"Your blight had reduced him to a monster,\" I explained, \"and his family paid me to end his suffering.\"",
								"\"He was always a monster,\" she hissed, stirring her pot once more. \"He was born to a nest of vipers. He deserved much worse.\"",
								"\"There used be more of you,\" I supposed.",
								"\"Three we numbered,\" she whispered, \"and protected these woods and the folk that lived within them for a century and more. We had a mortal family. A bloodline that had survived for generations of cunning folk.\"",
								"\"The family whose bodies you harvested to prolong your own life,\" I interrupted.",
								"\"Who sacrificed willingly to strengthen their community,\" the red woman tapped her spoon on the edge of her pot. \"A community the trees protected until this worm hired a monster hunter to kill us all. Not one was spared, except me. My sisters, our children and grandchildren and great grandchildren, all dead. The forest floor was soaked with their blood.\"",
								"She stood while she was speaking and unhooked her pot from the spit. Then she turned her back to me and began hobbling towards her hut. The raven on her shoulder continued to glare at me.",
								"\"When I was here last you convinced me your life was worth more than the coin I was offered for it,\" I explained. \"Now I want to collect on what it was worth. I've killed the man responsible for the death of your family. I want something in exchange.\"",
								"Her red eyes peaked back over her shoulder. She was afraid of me.",
								"\"I seek a cure for lycanthropy,\" I said calmly. \"I am told you may know of such things.\"",
								"She took a long time to decide. She stared at me. She looked at the head in the dirt.",
								"\"To cure such a thing,\" she began, \"there is a monster you must hunt.\"",
								"When her explanation was complete and I had asked my questions, she demanded I leave her forest. I did as she asked. Yet this time I was aware she had tried to charm me, unlike when she compelled me to attack Stelvi those years ago."
