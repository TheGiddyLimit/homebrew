To a swordmage, fighters are uncivilized brutes whose only answer to conflict is to hit things harder, while wizards are overly delicate and more at home in a library than the battlefield.

It is nearly impossible to rob a swordmage of it, and they are able to sense its location no matter how distant, and call it to their hand from any similar range.

Regardless of the specifics, all swordmages channel magic through their weapons, needing no other focus to cast spells.",
