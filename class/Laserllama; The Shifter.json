Charging forward, the brutish beast ran roughshod over the goblin bandits that were attempting to pillage this remote farm. As the would-be thieves fled into the forest, a similar flash of verdant light shone between the trees, and the wild dwarf walked out and returned to his dwelling.",
							"In the chaos of battle, the primal call of the hunt was almost irresistible. In one moment, she was the fierce lioness, tearing into the troll's vile flesh. In the next, she was a humble rodent darting unnoticed in the confusion of combat. As the dust settled, she returned to the shape of a wild female elf, what she knew to be her true shape. But even as she regained her composure, part of her deep within longed to eat of the carnage surrounding her.",

It was as if it was watching where he had left the key to the cells below. When the guard left, the same bird transformed into a primitive young boy, picked up the key, and lept out of that same window. That night, there would be a jailbreak from the baron's most secure dungeon.",
