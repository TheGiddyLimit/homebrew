								"A phantasm's form, power and aspect, are unique to each channeler; shaped by the evocative piece of memory that defines their being and drive. Memories that elicit a deep sense of regret, such as failure to prevent the deaths of loved ones may manifest as destructive phantasm with the power to hold onto the past. Precious moment of warmth and safety in a kindly blacksmith's forge may become a guardian phantasm that protects the channeler and others from harm. Recollections of a childhood friendship with a magical familiar may manifest a spell casting phantasm.",
								"Imperceptible to all but their masters and other channelers, phantasms are nigh indefensible in combat. They can also draw upon the flame of the channeler's soul to enhance their destructive powers or their master's skills."

								"A channeler's life inevitably revolves around the memory that created the phantasm. How is it possible to forget a piece of memory that stares at you every day with the quizzical look of a subservient automaton?",
								"Most channelers are outwardly indistinguishable from other members of their own species. Some of them aren't even humanoids. Due to their rarity, most channelers have never experienced the luxury of tutelage from other, more experienced, channelers. They typically develop their mastery through practice or self-discovery. Continuous use of their powers often lead to the discovery of new uses for their existing powers and evolution of new ones."

Then imagine how it affects the current life you are leading and why that piece of memory is so important to you and how it can cause you to behave. Is it a regret? A comforting nostalgia? Or perhaps a phobia?",
								"Your phantasm is the personification of that very memory. So, what does it look like? What's your relationship with it? Do you detest it as a constant reminder of your past trauma or will you find comfort in its presence? Every time you use its powers does it feel like a stab in the heart?",
								"Not all phantasm function the same way. Sometimes that piece of memory you hold dear is lost to you as it morphs into your phantasm. Would this cause you to resent it despite the powers it grants you? Are you on a quest to banish your phantasm and recover your memory? Perhaps you are blissfully unaware that an important piece of your memory has been stolen, but everyone else has noticed a drastic change in your personality due to the loss of a lifedefining piece of memory."
