But the Order of Desolation stands above the petty political squabbles dividing the Seven Cities.",

Each illrigger is expected to sow discord, pain, strife, deceit, and fear without instruction or supervision.

						"During this class's development, we wanted to merge the visions of our development team, playtesters, and the MCDM audience on what the Architect of Ruin should be. As a result, we revised this subclass many (many) times. At one point in testing, the subclass had the Pact {@action Magic|XPHB} feature; this felt fun and thematic to some, but limiting and frustrating to others. We tried out several versions of the Spellcasting feature\u2014a less-than-third caster, a third-caster, and even a half-caster! Many players wanted a sneaky illusionist with out-of-combat utility, while others wanted a gish with spells to empower combat.",
						"We learned that half-casting made the subclass too complex, while Pact {@action Magic|XPHB} was too limiting. After much iteration, trial, error, and oh-so-many playtests, we settled on the final Architect of Ruin design. This third-caster illrigger provides enough spells to create options without being overwhelming, and it gives the subclass exactly what we wanted: flexibility.",
						"No subclass is a perfect fit for every character, but that's why we offer so many of them! Manipulators and charmers can turn to the Hellspeaker, assassins can turn to the Shadowmaster, and so forth. Meanwhile, the Architect of Ruin is intended to make way for multiple play styles and support those who want a lot of options. Players who want a gish can turn to spells such as {@spell shield}, {@spell blur}, {@spell mirror image}, and {@spell haste}, while players who want more out-of-combat tools can choose spells such as disguise self, silent image, invisibility, and enchantment spells."

										"Hey, everybody! James Introcaso here\u2014just kidding, it's Sadie Lowry.",
										"Many in the MCDM community know my reputation for writing celestial-themed projects. I wrote six {@i ARCADIA} articles! There are memes about it! You can imagine my amusement when James scheduled a Discord call with me and broke the news: He wanted me to be the project lead for the infernal, Hell-centered revised illrigger. We had a good chuckle about that.",
										"But I was thrilled to be involved in revising the illrigger! Our goals were twofold. First, we would bring the illrigger further in line with other fifth edition classes, following groundwork laid by the incredible Mario Ortegón. Second, we would expand the class, adding two new subclasses (the Hellspeaker and the Sanguine Knight), retainers, and magic items.",
										"I {@i love} working on extraplanar material\u2013celestial or otherwise. When players are drawn to other planes, they're looking for something larger than life. They wander fey realms, looking for stories where fairy tales are true, promises can't be broken, and mischief and whimsy are as dangerous as violence and war. They walk the halls of the gods searching for a calling, the magic to purge evil and darkness, and a connection to a higher power.",
										"In MCDM's timescape, Hell is a place to rise to power. Illriggers navigate politics and warmongering, infiltrate or obliterate flimsy mortal hierarchies, and crush Goodness and Light under a gold-trimmed heel. Illriggers can be chaotic or logical, evil or pragmatic, warmongering or cunning, but they share a remarkable position in the power struggles of the Seven Cities. Their archdevils grant them terrible abilities and trust that few others are given.",
										"When players turn to the illrigger, they're typically trying to fulfill a fantasy about that power\u2013to lead armies, assassinate foes, manipulate politicians, or command blood as they gain prominence and infamy. Our team let that archetype\u2014the desire to gain and wield power\u2014guide us during the development process. The artists vividly captured scenes and brought them to life. The playtesters helped us ensure the fantasy {@i feels} right. Laura Hirsbrunner worked magic on the words to communicate that fantasy. And everything is under the strong vision of Matt Colville and James Introcaso, experts both in making a world feel truly epic and fantastical.",
										"But we can only bring the story partway. The rest of an illrigger's tale happens at the table as the GM weaves nefarious plots around their party members and builds on that fantasy.",
										"I feel very lucky to be even a small part of those stories I love so much\u2014stories where you make a promise you can never break, channel divine power through your very being, or rise as a threatening power player of Hell.",
										"I hope the stories you tell are nefarious, diabolical, and larger than life.",
										"Yours in vileness (for once)"

								"\"This book is...\" The timeless elf wizard held the tome open in one hand, pushed his long golden hair back with the other. \"If I had more time...\"",
								"\"Isn't {@i that} the point?\" Uluoria asked, flowing upright from her perpetual crouch and standing next to the memonek. \"Why did we bother dying to get that thing\u2014\" The protean hunter gestured at the {@i codex}. \"\u2014if it didn't have the answers?\"",
								"\"It almost certainly {@i does} have the answers, but...\" the first Soranis began.",
								"\"... it's doubtful we have the right questions,\" the second Soranis finished. The only difference between the original and his temporal doppelganger was the trim of his long blue robes. ERN-F8 sighed.",
								"\"The {@i codices} were crafted by terran wizards. Elves need no such tomes to master lore,\" the first Soranis explained.",
								"\"Time. Time is the key,\" The second Soranis added. \"If this were a wode.... But here, cause rules effect.\"",
								"\"Even two of us,\" the first Soranis said.",
								"\"We could spend many months studying this tome and only learn a fraction of its secrets,\" the second Soranis said.",
								"\"Weeks surely,\" the first one commented.",
								"\"Oh, you flatter us.\" The second one bowed.",
								"\"I thought it worked, we saw it work,\" Uluoria said. \"That's why there's...\" She gestured to the second Soranis. \"You're from the future. Don't you {@i know} what we did? Did we win or lose?!\" The tension, the inaction, was going to tear the already disparate group apart.",
								"\"In my future\u2014\" The second Soranis looked from Uluoria to Lady F8. \"\u2014the Time Ender slumbers still.\"",
								"\"Wonderful,\" Nuulus-Larr said, and the dark elf fished out a piece of pickled mushroom from a pouch.",
								"\"Wait.\" Magnus held up a hand. He inhaled slowly, a metallic smell tinged the air. \"It's starting, get ready.\"",
								"\"Finally.\" Lady Dazran stopped pacing, but stood on alert, fidgeting with the pommel of her great sword.",
								"The first Soranis closed the {@i chronos codex} and Uluoria readied her bow.",
								"A flash of light, and another portal opened. It stood like a black mirror fringed with bright blue crystals. There must have been a pressure differential between the library at the top of the tower and the world inside the portal, because air constantly rushed in, blowing their hair in the sudden breeze.",
								"\"They did it,\" Magnus breathed out with a sigh. \"The kids did it.\"",
								"\"They live.\" Zazamanc, the fire dwarf, growled, impressed. \"They live and their scheme succeeded.\"",
								"\"They served their purpose,\" Lady Dazran said flatly. \"Now it is our turn.\" Ignoring the debate over the {@i codex}, Lady Dazran turned to the group. \"I will lead,\" she said.",
								"\"You think so?\" Larr said with a sneer.",
								"No one moved.",
								"\"Well?\" Lady Dazran, Illrigger, asked. \"Why stand we here idle?\"",
								"Larr threw a warning glance at ERN-F8. It did not go unnoticed or unheeded.",
								"\"Maybe someone stays behind,\" the dark elf said.",
								"\"Keep someone in reserve,\" Zazamanc agreed, but there was a darkness to his tone.",
								"\"A {@i reserve}?\" Lady Dazran asked. \"Who?!\"",
								"\"One of the Soranises, maybe,\" the memonek knight said. And then got round to it. Her gaze rested on the hellknight. \"You.\"",
								"\"Me?! Don't be a fool, you wouldn't stand a...\" She stopped. She was brash, headstrong, utterly fearless. But she was not stupid. \"What is this? When have I given you cause to question my skill? Or is this another crisis of {@i conscience}?\"",
								"\"It's not your skill we question,\" Lady Fate said. \"It's your loyalty.\"",
								"She confronted the knight of Axiom. \"Is that what you fear? My {@i loyalty}? Hah!\" She surveyed the rest of the party. \"Is that why we skulk in this tower, in the shadows, out of sight, because you fear a betrayal?\" She sneered. \"A dramatic betrayal in a crucial moment?\"",
								"The second Soranis looked at his comrades. Someone had to say it. \"You serve Dispater. A Lord of Hell. Who knows what you might do? I don't think... none of us think you {@i will} betray us. We just think...\"",
								"Zazamanc finished it. \"We think you {@i could}.\"",
								"\"Betray you! Hahaha. You insects.\" She took a step back and surveyed the group. \"You see loyalty as the truth, the truth of a person. That one,\" she said, pointing to Magnus the prelate of Cavall, \"is loyal to Cavall. That is his loyalty, so that is his {@i character}. This one\u2014\" She pointed to the dark elf. \"\u2014serves only {@i skill}. That is his loyalty and so that is his character.\"",
								"\"I carry the seal of Dispater and thus you feel you know {@i my} character. But I have served with you these many weeks and what I have learned is that you have learned {@i nothing}.\"",
								"She put her hand on her sword. \"You know nothing of loyalty or character. I will fight with you, I will risk death and worse with you. I carry Dispater's seal, but I {@i serve} Hell. Hell is my world, as real and vital to me as yours.",
								"\"Beyond this portal, none of us know what we will find. I do not know what awaits. Only a creature powerful enough to collapse the entire {@i timescape} into one singular universe. What would happen to my world then? Yours? You question my loyalty when my {@i world} hangs in the balance?",
								"\"I do not fear what is beyond because we are Heroes from Seven Worlds. Chosen by the gods! By fate! Yet we sit here like mice and quarrel and doubt and fear and that will be our undoing! We face a god! A god of dragons! A god of time magics!\" She pointed to the portal. \"And the only thing {@i it} fears... is {@i us}.\"",
								"Lady Fate considered for a moment, then weighed in.",
								"\"If we do not work together, we lose.\" The others appreciated this sentiment. \"I don't think there's anyone here with your battlefield experience or, frankly, your zeal for battle. I have no fear. Axiom will follow Hell. What says Arcadia?\"",
								"The two true elves, standing a full head taller than anyone else in the group, looked at each other, and some unspoken thought passed between them. Then they turned to face the group.",
								"\"We have seen Lady Dazran's devotion to victory. Arcadia has no doubts. We will follow Hell.\"",
								"\"Quintessence?\"",
								"The fire dwarf warrior took a step forward. \"We of Alloy are no strangers to working with the Seven Cities. Quintessence will follow Hell.\"",
