He was quick to see the potential of the planar metropolis, even then known as the City of Doors, and began to enact plans to exploit from beyond its walls. Binder lore holds that he attempted this through his followers, who embedded short rituals to Aoskar into many of the city's portals. With time, his fellowship grew, and when the Temple of Doors was erected, almost half of the people of Sigil worshiped Aoskar though these rituals.",

When the Lady discovered this, her vengeance was swift and brutal. Overnight, the Temple of Doors and all those buildings for blocks around it were destroyed by a force unknown and unseen mid-sermon, all worshipers within those bounds killed in a single horrible instant. Aoskar vanished, responding to none, and it was not for centuries hence that his godcorpse was found in the Astral, head impaled with a multitude of blades. Today, the rule follows from Aoskar's cautionary tale: \"No Gods in the Cage.\""

With the power of this guild, and centuries to grow his influence in Skullport, the Eye grew his reputation as one of the most feared crime bosses of the city. Expanding his empire to the trade of illicit goods and slaves, the Eye quickly earned the ire of another eye tyrant, Misker, the Pirate Tyrant.",

At his signal, the armies turned against their leaders, the usurpers were thrown down, and Asmodeus reestablished his right to rule all Baator. Asmodeus returned them to power, but rather than reward Geryon, he gave his lone supporter's power and position to another.",
