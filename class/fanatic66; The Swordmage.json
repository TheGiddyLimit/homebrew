The shocked dragon has little time to react to the impossibly alive elf before her blade starts cutting through the dragon's scales.",

The bandit cries out in pain as his sword arm suddenly stops in place. With a chilling smile, the warrior plunges his blade into the bandit savoring the warmth of vitality gained from the bandit's blood.",

The synthesis of these dual studies is represented by a swordmage's weapon, which through magical bonding becomes the conduit of a swordmage's magic. As a wizard records their spell knowledge in a spell book, a swordmage inscribes their magical knowledge as glyphs on to their bonded weapon. Since a swordmage's bonded weapon is not only their tool in combat, but also their source of magic, swordmages treat this weapon with the utmost care. Although the name implies sword wielders, some swordmages choose other weapons such as axes, spears, or flails."

Regardless of the tradition's origins, the path of the swordmage entices those ambitious enough to focus on two opposing arts: swordplay and magic.",

Some swordmages were once simple warriors that after witnessing the wonders of devastation of the arcane, then decided to incorporate magic into their fighting style. Other swordmages were once apprentice mages that after a formative event, then realized magic was not enough to survive and achieve their ambitions. Either way, a swordmage requires a dedicated mind and body. One must seek new knowledge but also practice martial excellence."

Maybe you apprenticed with a swordmage mentor who taught you all they knew and you are now striking out on your own.",
