																"This was my first attempt in a long while at writing up a full class, and hopefully it turns out well! I recently had the opportunity to try out two interesting homebrew classes in real play: {@link The Companion|https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/HkbtsQUJGW} (by /u/shadowsocks) and {@link The Noble|https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_fO9drMhlUealJLdFBXTHp2OG8/view} (by/u/impersonater). Both were incredibly interesting to read, but upon starting a character sheet it became clear that they were overly complex and unwieldy. I had ideas on where to improve them, which got me into a class-making mindset and gave me the impulse I needed to finally go back to working on this old idea I had. (just as a note, The Companion class has improved tremendously over time, and the newest version is much better than the one I tried.)",
																"The current idea for the class was based around a larger homebrew I'm working on at the moment, but I've thought about this sort of plane-hopping vagabond before, and it seemed like a good fit. The name and uniqueness of the class were difficult though, because of course any adventurer could jump between the planes, and none had powers like these. This led to the development of their lore and the concept of \"The Journey\" and Planar Links, which help establish that these characters are different in meaningful ways compared to characters like the horizon walker ranger, for example.",
																"The name gave me trouble because while this could just be called \"The Planeswalker\", that name is overused and draws unwanted comparisons to Magic: The Gathering's idea of planeswalkers. This led to the derivative \"Planeseeker\" and \"Planar Wanderer\" names before I thought of the UA Mystic and their portal-based subclass, the Nomad.",
																"The mechanical identity of this class is meant to be similar in some ways to {@link The Warden|https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_RIYUWCXLYp-tLkT5MjwOd7fN71r7r-h/view} by /u/Layhnet (a very well made class): a primarily martial class with some magical ability, a sort of inverse of the warlock (a magical class with some martial ability).",
																"The last version that I posted of this finally got a good amount of solid feedback. The class was (rightfully) torn apart for a lot of shortcomings, and I've taken a lot of that constructive criticism to heart. I now proudly present the Nomad 2.0!"
