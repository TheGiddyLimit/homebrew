We assume (though the campaign you play in might have different assumptions) that psionics are, by definition, rare. Otherwise, why haven't we seen them in the game before?",
						"Sages in our fantasy worlds would have a technical term for these kinds of powers\u2014metaphysics, which might more rarely be known as psionics. One issue, though, is that \"psionics\" can sound a bit like science fiction. We don't normally refer to the human beings in a fantasy RPG as Homo sapiens. So we imagine that the people in our fantasy world would use more natural phrases to describe this phenomenon, which they don't really understand. They might refer to someone who uses these powers as \"having a rare talent,\" or \"possessed of a special talent.\" Over time, they'd start calling someone who uses these powers \"a talent.\" And something that started as a vague and broad description of a mysterious power becomes the actual name for it.",
