						"Sages in our fantasy worlds would have a technical term for these kinds of powers\u2014metaphysics, which might more rarely be known as psionics. One issue, though, is that \"psionics\" can sound a bit like science fiction. We don't normally refer to the human beings in a fantasy RPG as Homo sapiens. So we imagine that the people in our fantasy world would use more natural phrases to describe this phenomenon, which they don't really understand. They might refer to someone who uses these powers as \"having a rare talent,\" or \"possessed of a special talent.\" Over time, they'd start calling someone who uses these powers \"a talent.\" And something that started as a vague and broad description of a mysterious power becomes the actual name for it.",

						"The resopath chooses one creature they can see within 60 feet of them that has a challenge rating of 10 or lower (or that is 10th level or lower, for creatures that don't have a challenge rating), then psionically creates a perfect copy of that creature. The copy appears within an unoccupied space of the resopath's choice that they can see within 60 feet of them and acts immediately after the resopath. The copy has the same statistics as the original creature, except that they have mundane copies of the creature's equipment, and have no lair actions, legendary actions, or villain actions. The copy reflects the original creature's current state, including current hit points and available actions. The copy is loyal to the resopath and understands the commands the resopath gives them through a mental link they share. They disappear when they are reduced to 0 hit points."
