						"A human runs her hand across their blade tracing esoteric patterns that alight at a touch, flames flickering alive in their wake casting a sudden blazing light over the gloomy cavern, creatures of the dark shrinking back from the fire's light.",

						"A Spellblade combines magic and martial talent in a perfect blend, able to blend their use of them into a single art. Rather than being a Wizard that happens to be good with a sword or a Fighter that knows some magic, a Spellblade is defined by their ability to merge the spells and martial talents into a single strike: a Spellstrike",

								"Becoming a Spellblade isn't an accident - it's a difficult path to master and requires intense concentration and conditioning to master fluidly casting spells in the storm of battle in perfect sync with your attacks. Spellblades are, consequently, almost always driven by some form of motivation that have made them strive for this unique style of perfection. Some view it as an art or tradition important to them, some view it as the ultimate weapon to overcome a great obstacle, and some pursue it because of the challenge itself, seeking to prove themselves.",

Adventurers are already a rare breed, but Spellblades are rarer still, which often causes them to defy expectations",

								"The most important place to start when making a Spellblade is knowing what drew your character to this difficult and rare path. The path of a Spellblade is one that has few mundane uses - they are not scholars and their skills serve little purpose outside the adventuring arts, so what drove your character to master these? There's an intentionality to a Spellblade similar to that which might be found in a Paladin",
								"Determine if you learned your skills on your own through years of hard work, or if you had a master or school that passed down the art to you - does that affect the sort of weapons you use or the attitudes you take your skills and how to use them?"

								"You can make a Spellblade quickly by following these suggestions. If you wish to follow the Tradition of a Battlemage or Aethersword, put your highest score in Intelligence, and your second and third highest scores in Dexterity and Constitution respectively. If you wish to follow the Tradition of the Guardian, put your highest score in Strength, followed by Constitution, and then Intelligence. If you wish to follow the path of the Swiftblade or Spellshot, put your highest score in Dexterity, followed by Intelligence, and then Constitution. Choose a background that reflects your years of hard effort and study to master this unique route, preferably one that gives a physical and mental skill to represent your twin paths of mastery. When you gain cantrips at 2nd level, you can select either combat or utility options - you'll gain additional options when you reach 5th level and can use them with your Spellstrike, so you don't need to plan what you want to use with it at 2nd level."
