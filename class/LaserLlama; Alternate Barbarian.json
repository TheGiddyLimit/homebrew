						"The massive half-orc let out a blood- curdling battle cry as he leaped from the roof onto the back of the gargantuan blue dragon. As the great foe flew into the sky, he gripped the dragon's spines with a near- supernatural level of strength. No matter how much it twisted and turned, the dragon could not shake the warrior from his back. As the monster tired, the half-orc drew his greatsword and plunged it into the neck of the beast. After the dust cleared, the warrior emerged victorious from the crumpled heap of blue scales that had once terrorized the kingdom.",
						"As the goblins began to come over the ramparts, the young warrior emptied her mind and gave herself over to the bloodlust of battle. Her massive axe severed the head of the first goblin to climb the wall, and before its head hit the ground she had another goblin by the throat. As her foe begged for his puny life she let out a guttural roar and threw him from the top of the walls. Minutes later, she would come to her senses surrounded by the fallen bodies of those who had dared to assault the citadel of her ancestors.",
						"A rag-tag group of adventurers fled the collapsing tomb, a hulking white dragonborn leading the way. He could see the exit ahead, but his instincts told him that he was the only one fast enough to make it out before the roof caved in. Drawing upon the ancestral draconic fury in his blood, he shouldered the stone mantle of the doorway. When his final companion made it safely through, he let out a roar of triumph and the weight of the entire front wall of the temple fell behind him.",

For others, their Rage is an emotionless trance that allows them to ignore any emotions, loyalties, or injuries that would interfere with their fight.",
