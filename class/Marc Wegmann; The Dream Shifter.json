It seems like the stream of gold from new followers does not satiate the needs of the carnival anymore as it keeps moving  through the kingdom. A few days later the players hear that the carnival is nearby, and a person they are looking for hasj oined it or an obj ect they are looking for has been given to the carnival as a tribute.",

Loneliness and  disappointment slowly  drove them to  madness and  almost made them give up  their dream. Then  they  became a dream shifter and  with  their newfound ability to warp reality they finally had the means to  get validation  and  manipulate people into  joining  them to  become entertainers themselves. Because surely, this must be everyone's secret wish. And  so, the carnival had slowly  been  formed. The Carnival Avatar's appearance is either that of a surreal clown  or a combination  of musical instruments and seasonal festive decorations."
