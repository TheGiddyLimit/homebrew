The battlefield medic turned expert archer, the cowardly farmer with an uncanny intuition and sense of danger, and the soft spoken knight with a heart of gold are all examples of warlords that work with their party, rather than making the party work for them."

Warlords train for years to learn the skills of combat, mastering a variety of weapons and armor. It is the use of these martial skills on the front lines that allow their leadership to be more effective than a normal general could ever be."

First, make Strength or Dexterity your highest ability score, depending on whether you want to focus on melee weapons or on archery (or finesse weapons). Your next-highest score should be Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma, depending on the Warlord Archetype you want to choose. Second, choose the {@background soldier} background."
