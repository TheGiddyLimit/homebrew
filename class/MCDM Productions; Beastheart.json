						"Who doesn't want an owlbear best friend? How many collective hours have players spent trying to convince a beleaguered Game Master that with enough treats, coaxing, and successful Wisdom (Animal Handling) checks, they should be able to adopt that bulette or hell hound or gelatinous cube? Why do we like the fantasy of adventuring with wild animals (not to mention fiends or oozes) at our side?",
						"It's probably because the idea of a hero with an untamed pal is prevalent in many of our most popular fantasy stories. Knights befriend and ride dragons. Dire wolves charge into battle alongside the Stark children. Mija risks everything to save her titular pal in {@i Okja} And we want to tell similar stories at our tables! But these aren't just tales of heroic pets. Rather, these are stories of untamed creatures that choose to partner with a hero. These creatures are too wild to be truly controlled, but each loves the hero as they would a member of their own pack. Together, hero and companion charge into danger, ferocious and free",
						"{@i Beastheart and Monstrous Companions} codifes the fantasy of adventuring alongside a wild companion. This supplement presents rules for companions: wild creatures that any character in the game can befriend and bring along on adventures. They aren't always easy to control, but having a basilisk bud is totally worth it. The beastheart class then builds on those rules, letting a character work in maximum harmony with a companion. This new class presents a hero who is never without their faithful friend, and who shares a supernatural bond with a companion that allows both to perform incredible feats fueled by primal power",
						"This supplement is the culmination of months of hard work from artists, designers, editors, and many, many playtesters. It even underwent a public playtest, which dramatically improved the content. I can't thank the folks enough who took the time to give feedback.",
