He pulls out a harmonica from his pants and starts playing a catchy tune that slowly but surely shifts the mood of the place, enticing everyone to join the song, wether by complimenting the music or dancing. Once everyone has forgotten about the little fella's misdeed, he flees with a purse filled with the sap's money.",

Enraged, she tries to pursue her, only to fall victim to a trap that renders her motionless. As she tries to escape, the half-elf jumps in to inject her with her own poison, making her fall unconscious. She cages her and releases her friends, waiting for them to wake up to leave together.",
