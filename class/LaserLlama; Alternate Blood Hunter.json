						"When the young man's blindfold was removed he found himself in a dimly lit room surrounded by hooded figures. He stood in front of a small dais that held a vial of gleaming crimson liquid. Months of training had led him to this moment. If he survived drinking the vial, the Hunter's Bane, he would never be the same. Becoming more than human, he would finally have the power to avenge his family that lay dead all these years.",
						"As the horde of demonic spawn lurched toward her, the aging half-elf ran her thin blade along her palm, coating it in her blood. In an instant, the blood ignited, wreathing her sword in a ghastly blue flame. She fell upon the horde as a blur of azure fire and cold steel. She would show no mercy to the hellspawn today.",
						"In the light of the pale moon, an almost feral halfling got down on all fours to sniff the tracks before him. The scent of goblin was unmistakable, vile rags and rotten meats. With a bestial howl, the halfling grew in size and wiry gray fur burst forth from his arms and legs. As fast as the wind, the halfling werewolf began another hunt in the light of the full moon.",

Those who survive this ancient and deadly ritual are able to wield the signature sanguine magic that marks them as a Blood Hunter.",
								"The makeup of this sinister ritual varies by Order and era, with each incorporating monstrous curses and magic which grant a Blood Hunter the unique abilities of their Order. This ritual permanently changes the subject, inoculating its blood with monstrous power at the expense of what makes them a normal mortal. Wherever monsters lurk, there also are Blood Hunters who have given up their chance at a mundane life so they may stalk and slay the vile creatures of darkness."

The blood magic they use is older than the divine magic of Clerics and is a legacy of dark times when mortals were left to fend for themselves. Though their blood magic is grim in nature and unsettling in practice, many Blood Hunters place a great deal of pride in the elder traditions, rituals, and rites of their Occult Order."
