								"Popular as both wartime mercenaries and as peacekeepers, warmages are a unique breed of spellcaster, one that specializes in and perfects the use of the lowest level spells, cantrips. Warmage philosophy teaches that, with discipline, magic can be used at its lowest level as easily as a common warrior wields a bow, a sword, or an axe. When used in this way, magic is not a mysterious, unknowable force, but a trainable weapon, and can be taught to almost anyone with aptitude. The College of Warmages, as a result, has managed to field an army of highly effective (though comparatively simple) spellcasters.",
								"The College of Warmages is viewed with scrutiny (if not outright hostility) by the rest of the world due to their practices and teachings. For those without magical aptitude, the College's overpowering force is a perpetual threat. The College is a host unto itself, and its army, though certainly still honorable, is nonetheless wholly mercenary. A nation that enlists warmage aide in one war might find warmages allied with their enemies in the next.",
								"Wizards and sorcerers, on the other hand, see warmages as rudimentary and trite, largely because warmages do not understand the nuances of magic. Warmages are not interested in studying magic, nor do they wish to plumb the mysteries that confound spellcasters everywhere; they seek only to destroy. For this reason, warmages are even a threat to other spellcasters. Their single-minded utilization of magic has honed their magic's destructive potential, and their great numbers threaten rarer spellcasters in an outright battle. "

That being said, since the College accepts nearly any candidate that meets the training prerequisites, warmages might come from a myriad of backgrounds and beginnings.",

Were you apprenticed to a proper wizard or alchemist? As well, why did you choose to reject the path to become a proper spellcaster?",

Were you perhaps a town guard or militia man who came into contact with a Knight, Pawn, or Queen, and was awed by their prowess?",

A warmage is initiated into his or her house within the first week of being in the College, but they do not fully graduate until they gain their House subclass at third level. Being a member of a warmage house is much more for a warmage than just selecting a specialty; it is a part of their identity. They will have brothers and sisters the world over who know them by the medal they wear, the symbol they display; there are handshakes, code words, common slang shared between all members of a house, and dozens of other traditions large and small.",
