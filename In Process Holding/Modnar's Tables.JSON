of his ankles. If questioned, he relates a sad tale of injustice at the hands of his soulless captors.

If the PCs just close the bag after finding the dead cat, it will start wiggling and crying again. Any time the bag is opened, flip a coin again.

party.
1068. The sky turns green. Then the wind dies down and funnel clouds appear.
1069. Two ranks of royal guard form between you and an oncoming procession,
allowing the large entourage and perhaps the king himself - difficult to say with
all the covered carriages - to pass by.
1070. Volcanic activity sends rivers of lava across the road, threatening to cut the group
off in a sea of fire.
1071. A group of much less powerful adventurers meet the party on the road, returning
defeated from a nearby dungeon. They offer to give the party information on
what they saw there in exchange for a share of the treasure.
1072. The wind holds a scrap of paper against a tree. The paper turns out to be a
wanted poster offering a hefty sum for one of the PCs. The party has never been
near the town offering the reward.

draw closer, a lone wizard makes mystical passes in the direction of another tree.

1075. The road has potholes in it, wreaking havoc on steed and pack animal legs and
wagon wheels.

without tire.

steeds, wagons.

1079. A lone, decrepit milestone marks the distance to a city you've never heard of.
1080. The road you are on is now a ravenous, snake-like creature. It twists and writhes
beneath your feet. Its eyes pop open, and the face turns towards you.
1081. A ranger trains his bear on the side of the road.
1082. A band of twenty storm giants are incredibly stupid and bad at math. When they

1083. On the road ahead is an accident scene, with injured people and ruined vehicles.
1084. A huge earth elemental eats the road ahead.

which is literally 99% alcohol on fire.
1100. A farmer pushes a cart of hay towards town.
1101. A heavily wounded soldier.
1102. Flowing magma is not a threat at this distance. Still, the pungent scent in the air
can only worsen if you continue on this path.
1103. A small pouch showing a crest or emblem lies near the road. It contains lead
figurines of exquisite detail and in realistic poses.
1104. Two small children stand all alone beside the road. They are dirty and the
youngest one cries easily. They wait for their parents to return. They do not know
why their parents left.
1105. Poles with impaled rotting heads line the sides of the road.
1106. The bridge over the ravine seems to be out. Nearby a huge fallen tree stretches
across the expanse, promising a precarious crossing.
1107. Deep in the wilds, both sides of the road become crowded with floating mirrors.
1108. In a night passage through the woods, your party's scout stops everyone,
motioning for silence. As everyone becomes still, whispers come from among the

woods.
1110. Several beautiful drunk women stumble out of the bush and mistake the PCs for
wealthy merchants.

was going.
1113. A traveling sheriff stops the party and issues a citation for some minor infraction.
1114. Beggar asks for help.
1115. An immense dire wolf blocks the party's passage. Your hired guide raises a
quavering finger and points, uttering the local legend's name: "Frostbite!" He
then turns on his heel and runs back towards the village where you hired him.
1116. You are crossing a bridge when, suddenly, from behind one of the bridge's pillars,
a man steps out and demands you pay a toll to cross. You ask by what authority
does he collect the toll and the man produces a dubious looking bit of vellum with
what appears to be the King's seal stamped upon it.

ominous.
1118. A mud slide threatens to sweep the party into a swollen river.

the job is half finished.
1128. An empty gypsy wagon lies broken in a ditch.
1129. A gypsy intercepts the most charismatic member of the party and tells him of a
vision she had. She predicts the party member will find a beautiful person in the
next city and it will be the love of his life. She provides no further details. Later
on, a beautiful person flirts with the character.

ancient pagan deity.

1134. A will-o-wisp floats eerily across the center of the road.

gold for a secret mission to ransom a prince. The wagon driver gives several
bricks to the party for their help in the mission.
1136. Four goblins clad in loin cloths burst out of the bushes and accost the party with
piteous cries. They beg the party to rescue them from pursuing slavers. Seconds
later the party hears creatures fast approaching.
1137. As though from the blue, a large volley of arrows falls down among the party as
they travel along the road, but the attack is not repeated.
1138. See it? says the scout. "You must stand just so." Assuming the position, you can
see what the scout sees - an odd portal showing through to some blasted
landscape, floating in the air alongside the road, visible only from this one place.
1139. A large area of the road in front of you is covered with a thin layer of ashes and
soot. You hear crackling from above and look up just in time to see a fireball
come down towards you.
1140. A lightning bolt strikes the ground in front of you.
1141. A wizened gray mage stands beside the road. With taunts and abuse, he dares any

adventures with them.

1145. A drunken sailor stands on a bridge, issuing challenges.
1146. The troll demands a ridiculous sum to cross his bridge...or take his place as
guardian!

ambush.
1148. A woman stops and prophesies that one of the characters is going to die.

civilization, and how the city encroaches upon the woods and nature.

apples on each other's heads. Your hear one say, "I'll tell 'ma if you don't let me
shoot the crossbow too"

next town down the road.
1156. The road is littered with mines or bear traps.

1162. Travelling through this haunted country at night lands you in the bony clutches of
a barrow wight and his retinue.
1163. A large herd of cattle cross the road in front of you. As they cross, they become
spooked, for reasons unknown, and begin to stampede.

rogue looking to pick up a few extra coppers (silvers or gold too!) from the PCs as
they are distracted by the sheep.
1165. An earthquake shakes the area and tears a rift in the roadway. The rift might be a
small crack or as drastic as a 20 foot shift (1906 San Fran earthquake, for
example). This event should have impacts further down the road (on settlements,
other travelers, other encounters).
1166. In an area of volcanic springs, clouds of venting steam and jets of boiling
sulfurous water burst from the ground.
1167. The way ahead is suddenly a lot less picturesque as a hail of arrows flies towards
your group from nearby rocky outcroppings.

1169. Five cowled monks on a pilgrimage kneel in the middle of the road, praying
softly.

1171. Several chariots blow by chasing a large wild boar. Men scream, "In the name of

silence until a plaintive child's wail pierces the night, coming from among the
gloomy tombstones.
1173. A thief in a hanging cage at an intersection begs for a crust of bread. Children
throw baby potatoes at him.
1174. The road breaks out of the dense forest into a clearing. You see a large coach
house with outbuildings. Smoke rises from the chimney and you hear hearty
drinking songs within.

looks up to see a seven foot high flash flood bearing down upon them.
1176. Strange balls of light surround you, causing momentary confusion.
1177. A mob of villagers flee the brigands who burnt down their homes.
1178. A militia practices their ranging with a local catapult. For fun, a few decide to

willing to share their new toy.
1179. A mad enchanter, from a hiding spot, summons a large hedge maze invulnerable
to most attacks.

1181. You pass an inn at a crossroads when a sudden blast tears away the wall.

down not one hundred yards before you. Behind it, you spy two more.
1188. You hear music coming from a small box with numbers on it from the side of the
road.

1191. A group of peasants are met travelling to the market in the next town. They offer
cheap produce.
1192. The road is lined with criminals chained to stocks, with only hands and heads
poking through. A visible punishment for wrongdoers. Many of the criminals
shout they are innocent. Is this land corrupt or are the laws justly doled out here?
1193. A group of well-to-do merchants rest beside the road.
1194. The PCs find a voodoo doll the looks like someone they know.

1197. The road is blocked by a large but makeshift fortification, manned by a band of
kobolds, goblins or ratmen.
1198. What seems like a typical thunderstorm sweeps over the area. However, as the
storm reaches its peak with heavy rains and winds, strange things start to
happen. PCs hit with the rain suffer temporary polymorph effects, and trees
struck by lightning become sentient or turn into other objects or living things.
1199. A smouldering unattended campfire starts to burn the roots of a nearby tree.
1200. A skeleton lies at one side of the path. It shakes its head as if to say "don't go this
way" when someone passes it.

1202. The steeple of a church blocks the road.

carrots. His daughter is quite comely.
1204. A crazy prophet travels this road telling everybody they are just imaginary
characters in a game played between gods.
1205. As you negotiate the winding mountain pass you feel a tremor through your feet.
Instants later, it becomes a rumble then a roar as rocks begin to fall around you.
1206. What's that? A pale and dead body bobs up and down in the nearby river.
Perhaps an aquatic predator killed and stashed it underwater for future meals,
and it has floated up.
1207. While you rest alongside the road, a pair of bear cubs wander out playfully
towards you, questing for food. Ominous growls sound behind them as the
bushes part to reveal the mother, hurtling towards you.

recognizes.

surrender to them and reveal secrets in exchange for protection from its own
people.

accommodation and food from the friendly locals and fall asleep. In the morning
the village is empty and ruined, as if abandoned years ago.
1217. As the road passes through a hilly region, you spy a cave, from which can be
heard the voice of a singing female.
1218. As you turn the corner, a dwarf and elf are standing over a stack of goblin
corpses. They argue over the kill count. For a twist, change to a hobgoblin and
orc, standing over dwarf or elf corpses.
1219. Trudging through a blizzard, you party begin to hear songs in the howling wind -
siren songs which are increasingly difficult to ignore.

a thick blanket of feathers.

laid out in a curious pattern.
1234. As bandits attack, the robbers realize a friend of theirs is among the PCs.
1235. A passing traveler warns you the trees ahead are full of drop-bears, but he darts

off.
1236. A ghost blocks passage.
1237. An approaching funeral procession takes up the whole road, forcing the PCs off
the road.
1238. The PCs come to a rough and crumbly road. The ground was disturbed recently
by a bulette and the PCs may fall into an empty tunnel, an occupied tunnel (by
the bulette or something taking advantage of the tunnel), or just find the road
travel difficult.
1239. On the side of the road are dead animals in various stages of decay. You notice a

1247. A sable haired moose prances in the forest clearing.
1248. The gale is of such strength that going against it is difficult, and the flying road

ranged combat upwind near-impossible.
1249. Children sling stones at the party from the fringes of the road.
1250. You are moving along a road through heavy forest. The road ahead is blocked by a

crossed and demands a toll for crossing "his bridge."

of ale and roasting meat fills the air. They smile and wave at you, gesturing to
visit.

dark sentience. Those who camp nearby suffer nightmares and the attacks of evil
ghosts.
1264. You encounter a monk, a monkey, a turtle and a pig, all heading west.

1278. You decide to camp not far from the roadside, but while setting up, a ghost rises up and tries to possess you. (If successful, the PC runs off into the night, leading the party to a cave-in that claimed the ghosts' life, hoping the party will complete his long forgotten quest and allow his spirit to rest. If the possession fails, he beckons the party to follow. If they do not, he flies into a rage and attacks.)

1294. A goblin, on fire, runs shrieking past the party.
1295. So treacherous is the road, one of your mounts has thrown a shoe that cannot be found. There was no smith in the village you left behind.
1296. A goblin warrior proclaims himself the "King of Thieves." He carries a dagger and can hold his own in any battle against the PCs.

1300. Swinging from tree to tree, a mischievous band of monkeys besieges the party and try to seize a number of shiny objects.

1302. A dead horse, in full tack, lies dead in a ditch. The saddle bags are full of adventuring equipment, a few gems, a gilded goblet, and a map to what appears to be a treasure trove. Cursory examination shows signs of a struggle and drag marks leading further off the road.
1303. The group sees one group routing another leaving dying and dead behind.
1304. Noxious, bilious green gas covers the road ahead.
1305. An older gentleman hobbles along, apparently injured. If asked, he admits to being caught unawares and attacked by brigands and mumbles he should have known better.

1306. A young dog or other creature decides to playfully follow the party.
1307. A tree with bark chewed or clawed off at the bottom.
