				"Gods of the passions domain manifest in the vast and deep emotions and feelings that lie deep in the hearts of those in throes of passionate experiences. This includes gods of love and beauty, such as Aphrodite, Eros, Sune, Frigg, and Lliira, who champion the pursuit of love and caring in all its forms. It also includes gods of music, storytelling, bards, and the arts, such as Apollo and his muses, Pan, Bragi, Milil, and Sheela Peryroyl. These gods are patrons of bards, musicians, artists, and all who dedicate themselves to inspiring the hearts of others. The passions domain also includes gods of more hedonistic and carnal passions, such as Sharess and Dionysus, who promote the pursuit of the raw joys of hedonism, drunkenness, sex, and feasting.",
