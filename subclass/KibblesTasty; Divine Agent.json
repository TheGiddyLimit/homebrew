				"Not all priests are clerics. Not all problems can be solved by prayer and preaching. Sometimes a more subtle touch is needed to steer the world as the faith dictates, and that is the role of a Divine Agent. A blade in the night that commits the lesser evil for the greater good, or a quick end to someone that sniffed too close the Cult of {@deity Vecna|dawn war|dmg}'s business, both could be the work of these divinely guided rogues.",
