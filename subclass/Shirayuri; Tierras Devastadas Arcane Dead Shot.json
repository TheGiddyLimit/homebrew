If the target is within the weapon's range and there is a path large enough for the ammunition to travel to the target, the target must make a Dexterity saving throw. Otherwise, the ammunition disappears after traveling as far as it can. On a failed save, the target takes damage as if it were hit by the ammunition, plus an extra separate {@dice 1d6} of the weapons damage type, and you learn the target's location for the next 8 hours. On a successful save, the target takes half as much weapon damage, no extra damage and you don't learn its location.",
				"The extra weapon damage impacts again for another {@dice 1d6} when you reach 10th level in this class and a total of three times at 18th level."
