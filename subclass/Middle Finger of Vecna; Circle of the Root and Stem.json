These druids tend to vast and beautiful woodlands, taking painstaking, personal care of every single plant that grows within. The circle's most powerful druids strive to become trees themselves, using their divine magic to transform their bodies into rugged towers of bark and leaf, the better to guard their sacred forests.",
