				"Folklore tells of a caste of downtrodden serfs, forbidden to carry weapons, gifted the power to wield their own skeletons as lethal instruments of battle by a sympathetic yokai. With carapaces of dense bone and vicious, osseous claws bursting from their flesh, the serfs overthrew their masters, winning freedom and a bloodsoaked notoriety. Today, practitioners of this devastating technique are known as skeletal blades. Often finding work as mercenaries, bodyguards, and spies, they charge into battle clad in an ever-adapting armour of gleaming skeletal white.",
