				"Every Paladin answers a call, but while some are driven by their oath to a particular god or pantheon, the Acroamata are initiated into the secrets and mysteries of the source of Knowledge and Magic. These arcane protectors ensure that magic is used safely and prudently; some of them seek out and correct those who are reckless with their power. Some are dedicated guardians at universities and mages' guilds, others are loyal bodyguards of travelling wizards. Some are seekers of ancient magical relics. Whatever their calling, all know the power of arcane magic and that such power is dangerous.",
