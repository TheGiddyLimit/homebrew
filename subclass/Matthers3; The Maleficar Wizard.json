				"The study of magic is a field that many devoted scholars and wizards strive to master and understand. Many schools of magic are broadly accepted and admired all across the Forgotten Realms, while others are rejected and taboo. Mages who study the forbidden art of extracting magical power from blood are known as Maleficars. Practitioners of these arts usually do so in secret, as their magical abilities, rituals and spells tend to terrify anyone who witnesses, excluding most wizards and other magic users.",
				"The purposes of studying blood magic depends on each wizard. Many Maleficars study the magical source of blood for the pursuit of incredible power, willing to sacrifice anything if needed be. Some might practice these arts because, as magic researchers, it is their right to do so if not given an unethical use. Others might feel the duty of mastering these abilities so they can use them for others benefit, even if that leads to being exposed.",
				"Maleficars are pursued due to them being perceived as cruel and malevolent. Nonetheless, those assumptions are not unjustified, as many of these wizards are manipulated by fiends attracted to this type of magic power. Those who bend their will to these evil beings travel through the realms looking for life to usurp in benefit of their masters. The constant pressure caused by confronting these fiends is an evil that any practitioner of this art must face, even those with the best intentions are vulnerable to giving in to temptation or surrender to madness.",

						"When casting a spell of 5th level or lower, you may forgo spending a spell slot by sequentially rolling any number of your wizard hit dies until the rolled values add twice the level of the spell. No modifiers are added to these rolls. The spell must be one that you know and are able to cast.",

The number of health points spent count as damage to maintain concentration effects. You are still able to use this feature if no hit dies are available, taking your roll's result as 0.",
						"If the goal is not reached on any way, the result of all hit dies is lost, the spell is not cast, and you lose your action, bonus action or reaction used to cast the spell.
