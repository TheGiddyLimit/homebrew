While the eye is open, it requires your concentration, you may cast no spells, and the eye creates an area of antimagic, as per the antimagic field spell, in a 15-foot cone. At the start of each of your turns, you may decide which way the cone faces. Your eye closes if you lose concentration on the effect."
