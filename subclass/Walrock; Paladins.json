If it fails, the creature believes it has achieved its greatest desire, and hallucinates living its life under such conditions. This hallucination is convincing, and fully involves any of the creature's senses pertinent to the experience. The experience typically fully distracts the creature, and limits its awareness of other creatures and the true world around it, usually rendering it unable to take harmful actions or reactions. This creature repeats the Intelligence saving throw at the end of each of its turns, and this effect ends if the creature succeeds, takes damage, or after a minute has passed. Creatures immune to charm effects may not be affected by this portion of this ability."
