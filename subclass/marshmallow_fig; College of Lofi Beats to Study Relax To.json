				"At 6th level, your enemies also begin to feel the pure chill. You can use your music to calm someone who's just going too hard. When an enemy uses their reaction, you, using your reaction, can force them to make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a fail, your beats nullify their reaction and prevent it from making any reactions (including this one) due to its relaxed state of mind. It repeats this saving throw at the end of each of their turns.",
				"If the enemy fails this saving throw by 5 or more, they must make another Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. If they fail again, they fall asleep, as if effected by {@spell sleep} spell, provided they can fall asleep."

All enemies within 60 feet that can hear you must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a fail, for the next minute, they can no longer add their ability score modifier to any attack they make."
