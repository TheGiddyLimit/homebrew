				"Starting at 2nd level you learn to cast the namesake of the explosion magic school: {@i Explosion}. As an action on your turn you may choose a spell slot of 1st level or higher and begin casting the incantation for {@i explosion}.",
				"Until {@i explosion} is cast your speed is reduced to 5ft and you are unable to take any actions (other than the incantation), bonus actions or reactions until the start of your next turn. The incantation requires concentration, as if concentrating on a spell. If you lose concentration on the incantation any spell slots you have used are expended.",
				"At the start of your next turn, you may choose to either continue casting the incantation by expending another spell slot of first level or higher or cast the {@i explosion}.",
				"When you release the {@i explosion}, choose a point you can see within 500 feet. The area affected by {@i explosion} is a sphere with a radius of 15 feet times the total number of spell slots used in the incantation. Each creature within must succeed a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save the creature takes a number of explosion dice equal to the level of each spell slot used in bludgeoning damage or half as much on a successful save.",
				"For example, if at 5th level you use a 3rd level spell slot and another 3rd level spell slot in the incantation, you deal 6d8 bludgeoning damage with a radius of 30 feet.",
				"All damage caused by {@i explosion} counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. {@i Explosion} is considered a magical effect for spells and effects such as antimagic field, but is not considered a spell for spells and effects such as counterspell.",
				"Upon successfully casting {@i explosion} you suffer 1 level of exhaustion for each spell slot beyond the first used in the incantation. Any levels of exhaustion you gain from this feature are removed once you finish a short or long rest.",
