The truth is that many of them are perfectly sane, with dreams of enslaving demons for themselves, rather than the other way around. A select few are even strong enough to do so, rising through the ranks of their cult to become powerful priests and summoners, capable of calling upon armies of fiends and mortals alike to do their bidding.",

Creatures that you have summoned or dominated are always considered to be willing for the purposes of this ability."
