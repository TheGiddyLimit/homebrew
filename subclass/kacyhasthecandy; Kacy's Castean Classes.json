				"Among the more superstitious, inland-dwelling folk of Castea, the oceans and seas are things to be feared. According to myth and legend, the seas swallowed up ancient civilizations during the Great Storm, bringing about untold amounts of death and destruction. These people view the gods and clerics of the Depths domain in much the same way: as bringers of ill-fates. However, those who have a closer connection to the seas, such as those who reside on the coasts or islands, recognize that a swift death is only guaranteed if you fail to offer the proper respect. They know that if one offers deference and respect, the waters of the deep will return the gesture. Clerics of the Depths domain embody this dichotomy. They are people to be feared and respected, deliverers of both punishment and bounty. They are people of little patience and infinite wrath, and at the same time, deeply caring and giving souls.",
				"On Castea, clerics of the Depths domain typically worship Ashiadne Azai, the Ancestor goddess of ill omens and the seas, or another lesser deity of the ocean. These gods of the depths expect of their clerics two things: to warn the masses of the dangers of the sea, and to demonstrate what happens when you disrespect their power. They loathe above all else arrogance and ignorance, and command their clerics to punish such behaviour with the wrath of the waves. Additionally, clerics of this domain will act as stewards and guides for those who wish to go to sea. They will make offerings or sacrifices to their deity to ensure a seafaring crew's safe return, bless ships and other vessels, or even accompany sailing crews to provide safe passage on treacherous journeys.",
