Objects that are \"not there\" are gone, although their absence does not cause ceilings to collapse or other damage. A wizard could walk through a \"not there\" wall without difficulty.",
				"When two parties perceive a there/not there object differently, the object functions for each party according to its own perceptions. For example, a wizard hides behind a rock that he sees as \"there.\" Her enemy, a fighter, perceives the rock as \"not there\" and fires arrows at the wizard. The wizard would perceive the arrows as bouncing off the rock, while the fighter would perceive the arrows as missing their target or falling short.",
