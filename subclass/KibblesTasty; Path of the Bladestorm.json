				"Barbarians are notorious for being engines of destruction on the battlefield, and for none is this more an apt description than those that have chosen the Path of the Bladestorm. They are barbarians whose rage is such a transcendent force that their very weapons are restless embodiments of their destructive wrath. When a Path of the Bladestorm Barbarian walks unto a battlefield, those unprepared to withstand the rain of sharp steel ought to run away and hide until the storm passes. The ones who stay will have to face the winds of destruction and will soon be drenched by flying droplets of blood as the barbarian at the center of the maelstrom smashes, hacks and slashes at the strength of primal winds. Woe to the foe who would stand before the storm.",
