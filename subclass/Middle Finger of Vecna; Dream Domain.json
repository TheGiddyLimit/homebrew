				"Understanding your dreams is to peek into a wider reality, occupied by spaces and beings scarcely imaginable to the waking mind. Clerics of Dreams venerate nameless, ancient gods that slumber unseen, whose very dreams send ripples throughout the multiverse. They feel the presence of these beings in their own dreams, and are unshakable in their conviction that they will one day awaken.",

Ultimately, the power of one's dreams can supplant reality, for the two are not so different.",

				"At 1st level, you can interpret the symbolism of a dream to learn what sort of fears, concerns, or prophecy inspired it. If a dream originates due to fear or stress on the part of the dreamer, you can gain insight into its reasoning, its emotional state, and something that looms large in its mind (such as something it worries over, loves, or hates.) If the dream is divine in origin, the dreamtelling acts as a {@spell commune} spell, with the question asked relating to a great fear or concern of the dreamer. After interpreting the dreams of a creature, you have advantage on Charisma checks you make against it for 1 hour."
