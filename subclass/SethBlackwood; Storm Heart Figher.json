They benefit from a magical phenomenon that causes their body to be able to store a massive electric charge, and release it as easliy as they would a breath of air. This makes them very dangerous fighters, and even lovers; because if they are not disciplined enough all it takes in small flare of emotion, and the person standing closest to them may be struck by lightning.",
