				"Ruin is more and less than physical annihilation - something ruined has been left without value or is otherwise perverted. Gods of ruin\u2014such as Barbatorum, The Devourer, Talos, Tharizdun, and Shiva\u2014are agents of destruction and dissolution. They seek a more permanent state of decline in the world; that forces of destruction should always howl against the forces of creation. Followers of these gods may wish for only devastation of some object, idea, or system with no designs of creation. Others wish for a future of growth and uplift, but know that their part is only to precipitate loss and defeat.",
