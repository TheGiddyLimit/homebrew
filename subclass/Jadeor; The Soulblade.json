				"At 1st level, you have learned how to manifest a magical weapon. As an action, you can summon this weapon to your hand. You can choose the appearance of the summoned weapon, but it counts as a simple melee weapon worth 1 sp that you are proficient with. It deals {@damage 1d6} radiant damage on a hit. This damage increases as you reach certain levels in this class, to {@damage 1d8} at 6th, {@damage 1d10} at 14th and {@damage 1d12} at 18th level. You use your Charisma instead of your Strength for attack and damage rolls you make with this weapon. You can use your Chosen Blade as your spellcasting focus. You can dismiss it as a bonus action, making it disappear. If another creature tries to pick up your blade, it disappears unless you stabbed it into the ground, in which case only you can lift it.",
				"At 6th level, you can also absorb the magic of one magic melee weapon into your chosen blade by performing a 1 hour ritual while holding the weapon. Your chosen blade gains all magical properties of the other weapon but retains its own shape (e.g., +1 is a magic property, reach is not). The absorbed weapon loses all magic properties until your chosen blade absorbs the magic of another weapon. Your chosen blade can only retain the magic properties of one weapon at a time."
