				"An Arcane Marksman studies a unique method of archery that weaves magic into attacks to produce supernatural effects. These techniques are the favorite of a variety of expert marksmen, including elite elven sentinels, dwarven gnoll hunters, and a number of well-known mercenaries. These fighters can turn a simple arrow, bolt or even sling bullet into a vessel for magic that harms and debilitates their enemies. Requiring both a mastery of ranged combat and an understanding of the arcane arts, Arcane Marksmen stand out as versatile and effective sharpshooters.",

						"This subclass is a replacement of the Arcane Archer presented in {@i Xanathar's Guide to Everything}, which dissatisfied me in a number of significant ways, including being bow-only and having highly limited usages of its core identifying feature. So, I designed this to fix my issues with the subclass, and polished up some other aspects along the way, as well as generalizing the flavor away from being elf-centric. Here's some of my thoughts on the changes I've made, which also serves as a changelog from the XGE version:",
						{
							"type": "list",
							"items": [
								"Name switched to Arcane Marksman to distinguish from the regular XGE version and to make the archetype more clearly not restricted to bows.",
								"I assume the elven lore connection is a Forgotten Realms thing. I've gone and made the archetype setting agnostic. This is also why they get just Arcana proficiency rather than nature/arcana.",
								"Magic Arrow and Arcane Shot were combined into one feature, as they were not really that separate anyway. The bows-only restriction has been lifted (here and in subsequent features), as that was pretty much totally arbitrary. Now you can have arcane crossbowmen and slingers too.",
								"Number of arcane shots per rest was increased to Intelligence Modifier, to promote investing in Int and also promote use of the Arcane Archer's iconic feature. This also means that the extra damage per shot needs to be lower than with 2/rest, so I've bumped them down to 1d6/2d6.",
								"60ft on Curving Shot seemed kind of excessive, I think 30ft fits the flavor a bit better without significantly impacting the power level.",
								"Ever-Ready Shot was buffed, since you now have more uses but each individual shot is weaker. Also added an ammo ribbon to it.",
								"The original subclass was missing a 10th level feature (regardless of what the designers say on Twitter), so Forceful Shot was added. The feature is not directly useful to you (disadvantage on ranged vs prone), but adds anti-flying and teamwork utility.",
								"All references to \"arrows\" were changed to \"shot\" to allow any ammunition to be used.",
								"Piercing Shot's extra damage was flipped to Force (ironically, given its name) as it seems more fitting for an ethereal attack.",
								"Seeking Shot's extra damage was flipped to Piercing, as Force damage seemed unfitting for a divination effect."
