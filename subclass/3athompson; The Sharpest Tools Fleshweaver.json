				"You modify your body to grow a natural weapon of your choice or improve a natural weapon you already possess. When you attack with your natural weapon, you can add your Intelligence modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, to the attack and damage rolls. Choose one of the following natural weapons. You can change your natural weapon whenever you finish a long rest.",
				"{@i {@b Bite.}} You grow fangs, mandibles, or a spiky maw. Your natural weapon is a simple melee weapon that deals {@dice 1d8} damage on a hit. If you hit a creature no more than one size larger than you with your bite, you can use a bonus action on the same turn to gain temporary Hit Points equal to your level.",
				"{@i {@b Claws or Talons.}} Each of your hands transforms into a claw or talon, which you can use as a simple melee weapon that deals {@dice 1d6} slashing damage on a hit if it's empty. Any infusions that are applied to one claw or talon apply to the other claw or talon. If you attack with a claw or talon using the Attack action, you can make one additional claw or talon attack as a bonus action on the same turn.",
				"{@i {@b Hooves.}} Your feet turn into hooves. The hooves are a simple melee weapon that deals {@dice 2d6} bludgeoning damage on a hit. If you move at least 20 feet straight towards a creature no more than one size larger than you and then hit it with your hooves on the same turn, you can use a bonus action on the same turn to attempt to shove the target back 5 feet.",
				"{@i {@b Horns.}} You grow horns on your head. The horns are a simple melee weapon that deals {@dice 1d10} bludgeoning or piercing damage on a hit (your choice when you take this feature). If you move at least 20 feet straight towards a creature no more than one size larger than you and then hit it with your horns on the same turn, you can use a bonus action to attempt to shove the target prone.",
				"{@i {@b Stinger.}} You gain a sharp natural weapon that secretes its own venom. The stinger is a simple melee weapon that deals {@dice 1d6} piercing damage on a hit. You can use a bonus action to coat the stinger in your natural venom. A creature hit by your stinger when it is coated in venom must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC, taking {@dice 2d4} poison damage and becoming poisoned until the start of your next turn on a failed save, or taking half as much damage and suffering no other effect on a success.",
				"{@i {@b Tail.}} You grow a tail that is effective in combat. The tail is a simple melee weapon that has a reach of 10 feet and deals {@dice 1d8} bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage on a hit (your choice when you take this feature). If you hit a creature no more than one size larger than you with your tail, you can use a bonus action on the same turn to attempt to shove the target back 5 feet.",
				"{@i {@b Tentacles.}} You grow a tentacle...somewhere. You can transform one of your hands into a tentacle as well. The tentacle is a simple melee weapon that has a reach of 10 feet and deals {@dice 1d6} bludgeoning damage on a hit. If you transformed your hand into a tentacle, you can use it as a weapon only if it's empty. If you hit a creature no more than one size larger than you with your tentacle, you can use a bonus action on the same turn to attempt to grapple the target."

The item must be worn to receive its powers, such as a cap or armor, or it must apply to a weapon. When you infuse an item in this way, you instead modify a creature's body in some way to gain the same ability the magic item provides. The graft is considered part of the creature and can't be removed against the creature's will unless the infusion ends on it. A creature's hit point maximum increases by 3 for every infusion you graft to it.",

You may change the body part that the infusion applies to, such as applying a boots of flying infusion to your arms. Infusions that apply to rings or neckwear such as amulets do not need to be applied to a body part. You can also apply an infusion that applies to weapons to a creature's natural weapons or unarmed strikes.",
				"If you apply an armor infusion to a creature's body, they gain natural armor if they do not already have it, or their natural armor is improved. When the creature isn't wearing armor, its AC equals 13 + its Dexterity modifier or 16, plus any bonus to AC the infusion provides. A shield's benefits apply as normal while the creature uses the natural armor."
