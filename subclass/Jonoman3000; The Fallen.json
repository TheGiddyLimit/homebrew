				"Your patron was once a resident of the upper planes, though they are no longer. Cast out by their kin, they have departed from their celestial origins and dabbled in darker magics. Though fallen angels are the most well known patrons of this type, there are many celestials capable of falling from grace. Some warlocks bind themselves with a fallen Empyrean, ki-rin, unicorn, couatl, or other such creature, but fallen angels are by far the most common.",
				"Through your connection with your patron, you gain both holy and unholy powers. It is common for warlocks of the Fallen to be mistaken for Celestial warlocks, as they tend to wield the powers of the divine more often than not. But as combat drags on and a Fallen warlock becomes more desperate, their mind and body transfonn as they unlock their darker powers. Your hair, skin, and eyes might change color, and your personality might change as well, perhaps even drastically. Even an altruistic idealist could become a merciless killer.",
