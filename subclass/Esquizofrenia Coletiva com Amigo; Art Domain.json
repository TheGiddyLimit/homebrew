				"Art Domain clerics are those who, in their religious temples, churches and abbeys, chant praises and songs that enchant and excite all the faithful, but their main aim is to show the beauty of art when it is directed towards their god. A bard who, faced with the difficulties of life, needed shelter in a convent and there learned the beauties of religious life and there converted to Art Domain, a minstrel who dedicated his poetry and texts to magnify the deeds of his god and his church. In all these cases, art was the means they found to live out their faith, and this is what a religious artist strives for.",
				"These clerics are not tied to specific deities, as their songs and praises can be dedicated to any deity or belief, as long as their art is required. Cultists who worship Vecna may want songs and poems in their rites that intone the beauty of necromancy, and devotees of Pelor may request the presence of these clerics to worship the sun at a summer solstice festival.",

As a bonus action, you can create a bond between you and your companions by choosing a number of them within 18 meters of you equal to your proficiency bonus. For 1 minute, you and your bonded companions can add your Wisdom modifier to all your skill and endurance tests and attack rolls. When a bonded companion takes damage or fails a resistance test from an effect originating from a creature you see within 27 meters of you, you can use your reaction to force this creature to make a Wisdom resistance test against your magic DC, suffering 3d8 psychic damage if you fail, or half if you pass. After using this ability, you can't use it again until you've completed a long rest."
