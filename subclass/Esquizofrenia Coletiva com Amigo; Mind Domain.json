				"The domain of Mind is linked to the forces surrounding mind control, manifesting the psychic and aberrant power of the gods of the astral plane in Dungeons & Dragons settings. Deities such as Ilithid, Mind Flayer, and Yog-Sothoth are patrons of mind clerics, who specialize in manipulating minds, causing confusion, and exploring psychic nooks and crannies. In addition, these clerics also channel powers related to visions, cosmic knowledge and deep insight, representing the connection with the mysteries of the astral plane. Gods of the Mind domain also personify intrigue (Tharzidunn), forbidden knowledge (Vecna), and the search for truth beyond mortal comprehension (Cthulhu).",
