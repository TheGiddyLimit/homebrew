Rather than being granted divine magic and authority by a deity or powerful idea, clerics of the Ur Domain siphon off the energies granted by gods to divine spellcasters, using it for their own needs without giving even lip-service to any god. Ur-Priests can come from any walk of life, but the most dangerous are always ex-clerics and paladins who have abandoned their gods. They violently oppose religion in any form, and use their powers to weaken the gods and destroy their followers.",
