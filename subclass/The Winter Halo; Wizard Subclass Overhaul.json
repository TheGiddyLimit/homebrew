				"Starting at 2nd level when you select this school, you can use your action to conjure up an inanimate object in your hand or on the ground in an unoccupied space that you can see within 10 feet of you.",
				"This object can be no larger than 3 feet on a side and weigh no more than 20 pounds, and its form must be that of a nonmagical object that you have seen. The object is visibly magical, radiating dim light out to 5 feet, and is worth 0 gp for the purpose of being used as a spell component.",
				"To conjure an object, you must have at least a vague understanding of how it works and is created; for example, most wizards are likely to know roughly how a {@item Chain (10 feet)|PHB|metal chain} or {@item breastplate|PHB} is made, or how an {@item arcane focus|PHB} is constructed, but not how an {@item antimatter rifle|DMG} is made. Additionally, the object you create cannot be worth more than 400 gp. Hazardous materials conjured by this feature do not retain their hazardous properties and only deal damage appropriate to the damage dealt by being crushed, stabbed, or cut by the object. For example, a 20 pound ball of half-cooled magma created by this spell does not deal any fire damage, but it can deal damage appropriate for an improvised weapon when thrown, and it might do much more damage when dropped off a cliff onto someone's head at terminal velocity. Poison generally acts as an inert paste or liquid, and explosives do not detonate. A conjured block of ice does not deal extra cold damage to a fire elemental. These general rules of thumb hold true for other exotic materials like powerful acids, normally radioactive substances, and more. The object disappears after 1 hour, when you use this feature again, when you use an action to dismiss it, or if it takes any damage. Armor does not take damage when it is used for its intended purpose. Starting at 14th level, you can create an object that weighs up to 200 pounds and is up to five feet on a side."
