The thicket has hit points equal to your Warlock level + your Charisma modifier. Any creature that hits the thicket with a melee attack takes {@dice 2d10} piercing damage. At the start of your next turn the thicket recedes back into the staff. You can't use this feature again until you finish a short or long rest."
