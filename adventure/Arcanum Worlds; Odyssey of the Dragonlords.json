They dismantled their towers and composed new melodies\u2014songs of repentance\u2014which once more carried on the winds to the ears of the Titan. He was unmoved. \"Were they truly repentant, they would not sing so brazenly, but they would go meekly and offer the proper sacrifices in place of songs.\"",
						"This time, the sirens were utterly stricken. They had believed that their songs were cherished by the gods. Their voices were stilled, and in the ensuing silence, the brilliance of the city faded into shadow. Stone foundations cracked, and pediments grew heavy. The pillars collapsed, and the city of the sirens sank deep into the ocean, swallowed by churning waters. Even its name was forgotten.",

There are very few shrines to her, but bards and poets call upon her for inspiration as \"the Muse.\"She is the swiftest of all the gods, both in thought and deed. She is capable of disappearing in the blink of an eye, and she can travel great distances with mere steps. Her mind is equally swift. Her voice is said to be more beautiful than any instrument.",
				"Kyrah regularly travels through the Heartlands in the guise of an adventurous bard. She carries dozens of scroll-cases with her, most of which contain terrible poems of her own composition. She can write good ones, but she prefers the bad ones, because she is so amused by people's reactions to them. No matter how harsh the critique, she never holds grudges against critics. She serves as the court poet to the Queen of Mytros, her sister Vallus. Vallus finds Kyrah annoying, and she finds any excuse to send her away on errands.",
				"Kyrah wishes above all else to write a great epic poem, something that would make even the Mother Goddess herself laugh and weep. In her search for new material, she is attracted to heroes who perform great deeds, as well as those who are fated to meet terrible ends. She is flirty, witty, clever, and attractive, but for reasons that she never makes clear, will never consent to marry anyone who cannot beat her in a foot race.",
				"Kyrah came to Thylea as a young bronze dragon. She served as the mount for the infamous Dragonlord Estor Arkelander. She is still weighed down by shame for the atrocities that Estor committed while the two of them were oathsworn. Kyrah cannot transform back into her dragon form until the Oath of Peace ends.",
				"Kyrah seeks to atone for the sins of Estor Arkelander by doing as much good as possible. She is full of optimistic energy, and she refuses to stand by when even the slightest injustices go uncorrected and unpunished. Kyrah detests sitting still, and her eagerness for a good story makes her a bit reckless. She will sometimes goad mortals into dangerous acts of heroism, hoping for dramatic material that she can use.",
				"However, she never acts maliciously, and she is careful to study prophecies; she doesn't make unreasonable demands. Kyrah loves to play tricks, large and small. Consequently, few people worship her, but nearly everyone believes in her. She is often \"credited\"when things go missing, or when objects suddenly reappear without explanation. She is especially fond of playing pranks on humorless tyrants and petty bullies, such as King Acastus of Mytros."

In the years that followed, a vengeful madness grew in her mind. Now, Lutheria schemes to capture the souls of the sinful, to fuel her dream of transforming humanity into brutish beasts, remaking their world into an endless nightmare.",
				"Lutheria takes the form of a beautiful, black-eyed woman who sleepwalks through the underworld, greeting the spirits of the dead. She has a third eye upon her forehead that usually remains closed, but when opened allows her to see through the eyes of the dead in the underworld. When she does this, her third eye moves independently of her other eyes in a disconcerting manner. She carries a crystal scythe, which she uses to harvest the souls of those who displeased her during their lives. Lutheria expects her followers to live without remorse or thought of the consequences: to drink, dance, and feast to your heart's desire, because any day could be your last.",
				"Lutheria views the mortal races as playthings, and she takes great pleasure in reducing them to the status of beasts. She created the maenads and goatlings in mockery of the human settlers, and she delights in the destruction they cause to outlying villages. She sincerely believes that she will one day be worshipped by every living creature in Thylea, and she hopes that this is best accomplished by deadening minds and appealing to baser instincts. For those who resist, she conjures nightmares as punishment for their lack of faith.",
				"Worship of Lutheria is rare among settlers, but she is nevertheless honored with many feasts and festivals because Sydon demands it, in addition to annual wine festivals and secret bacchanals. Whenever any drink is poured, a libation must be made to Lutheria or else a swift punishment is sure to follow."

Pythor abandoned his dragon wife when he took on his immortal humanoid form, and she has never forgiven him. Hexia has jealously dedicated her life to destroying Pythor's happiness and, over the centuries, she has murdered many of his mortal lovers and children.",

She is the oldest daughter of Mytros and, in many ways, she has inherited her mother's place as patron goddess to the city that bears her name.",

She remains a pillar of strength holding the city together as things are beginning to fall apart elsewhere. However, in spite of her best efforts, the citizens of Mytros increasingly offer prayers and sacrifices to the treacherous Titans. Vallus accepts this with grace and humility, and in spite of her declining power, she will do anything to defend her city.",

This is partly because she understands the importance of appearances in the world of mortal politics\u2014but she is also vain.",
				"Vallus is extraordinarily perceptive, often to the point where she is suspected of mindreading. She always seems to discern truth, even when she is told a clever lie. A hard stare from Vallus is often enough to make even the most skilled liars concede the truth. Vallus has lost much of her faith in the future of Thylea. Although she endeavors to protect the Temple of the Five in Mytros, she has witnessed too much of Thylean history to believe that the Oracle's prophecy will result in anything but total disaster.",
				"Vallus has one regret: her marriage to King Acastus. Over the centuries, she has been intimate with many beautiful mortals who captured her heart, but her union with Acastus in 478 CE was entirely political. The two have grown to hate each over the years, not least because Acastus makes a point of treating his many infidelities as sport. They have no children, although Acastus probably has many unacknowledged bastards.",

While Telamok was responsible for almost as many atrocities as his brother Estor, Vallus understands this was part of the cost of settling in Thylea. She is not wracked with the same second-hand guilt that plagues Kyrah."

He delights in creation, rather than destruction, and he is always intrigued by an intricate new device or stratagem.",

						"Welcome to {@italic Odyssey of the Dragonlords}. This booklet will provide you with everything you need to run an epic campaign in the forgotten land of Thylea.",
						"{@italic Odyssey of the Dragonlords} is heavily inspired by stories from ancient Greek mythology. As we designed the campaign, we sought to include ideas from many different sources: {@italic The Odyssey, The Iliad, Jason and the Argonauts, The Oresteia,} and others. However, Thylea is {@bold not} ancient Greece. You will not find Zeus, Athena, or Apollo among the gods.",
						"As you explore Thylea, you will encounter familiar tropes, monsters, and treasures from Greek mythology\u2014but the rules are different here. Mortals have only recently come to these lands. The world of Thylea blends high fantasy with the trappings of ancient history. Elves, dwarves, and halflings now live alongside minotaurs, centaurs, and satyrs.",
						"Our goal is to make your party feel like heroes from one of the greatest stories ever told\u2014but the ultimate end of that story is entirely within your power. Your players will make choices that forever change the world of Thylea. As the gamemaster, we encourage you to embrace this idea and run with it. How will your players reshape history\u2014and what does it mean to be a hero?",

						"The very first epic roleplaying campaign took place over 3,000 years ago. A band of heroes gathered to undertake an impossible quest, and among them were the children of Hermes, Apollo, Poseidon, and Zeus. They were the Argonauts\u2014the legendary sailors led by Jason. Their ranks included Orpheus, the most talented musician in the world, and Peleus, the father of Achilles. They were even joined by Hercules, the famous warrior, who had recently completed his fabled Twelve Labors.",
						"Why should we liken the heroes of the {@italic Argonautika} to a party of roleplayers? Because in spite of their illustrious qualifications, and in spite of prophecies which foretold success, the Argonauts were ill-equipped for the challenges that awaited them. They abandoned their quest almost as soon as they set sail, and the rest of the story unfolds like a comedy of errors.",
						"Fellow game masters, stop me if this sounds familiar.",
						"Jason of Iolcos bears an uncanny resemblance to your average tabletop roleplayer. When he isn't accidentally slaughtering his own allies, he's wallowing in self-pity and bemoaning his bad luck. He seems just as frightened to lead the party as he is of being usurped. At multiple points in the story, the gods are forced to step in and save the Argonauts from his terrible leadership. In the end, the Golden Fleece is secured through the magic of the sorceress Medea. She isn't even counted among the so-called heroes.",
						"The heroes of Greek mythology are very different from the super-powered, self-sacrificing paragons that we've come to idolize in Hollywood films. In the Greek epics, there is no clear line between good and evil, no villains to thwart, no alien invasions to repel. Heroic deeds are frequently puzzling and at times infuriating. Odysseus punctuates his harrowing journey home by murdering all the men who courted his wife. Achilles refuses to fight when his men need him most. Jason quickly abandons Medea once his quest is finished.",
						"Because of their flaws, it is hard to shake the feeling that the heroes of the Greek epics were real historical figures. When might fails, they succeed through cunning, and when cunning fails, they succeed through luck. These were mortal men cast into impossible situations, forced to survive through spectacular means, and left to brood on the fickle whims of fate. In spite of their divine parentage, they were, above all, very {@italic human}.",
						"This is in large part what makes these characters so enduring in the Western imagination. But most importantly, it makes them the perfect archetypes for the heroes of your next roleplaying campaign.",

They are jealous, capricious, cruel, generous, vengeful, kind, vicious, forgetful, thoughtless, lusty, selfish, passionate, and generally all-too-human in their ways. They do not know everything and cannot control everything, but within their spheres of influence, they are awesome, terrible, and dangerous. It's a foolish mortal who disrespects the gods. The wisest heroes acknowledge the power of the gods over every aspect of life.",
								"Mythic heroes must also contend with the will of mortal kings and queens. Earth-shattering events demand action from the most powerful rulers from across the land, but their hands are often bound by the vagaries of fate. Sometimes, they are forced to take up arms and join the quest themselves, but more often they must depend upon the might of famous heroes."

Oaths have a powerful, far-reaching effect on society. They may create peace between the gods, promote unbreakable fellowships, and even instigate bloody wars.",
								"No mortal of sound mind would ever dare break an oath, lest they be afflicted by terrible curses. To be cursed by the gods is to be cursed by the land itself. Food turns to dust in the mouths of those who are cursed. Harpies peck out their eyes, and their souls are dragged screaming into the Underworld.",
								"For this reason, even the bravest of heroes fear the consequences of breaking an oath. The gods, on the other hand, are literally incapable of breaking their oaths, for they are made from the same magic that binds and enforces them."

Famous heroes may summon warriors to their aid, influence the opinions of the masses, and even demand audiences with the gods. Though seeking it may shorten one's life, fame is the most direct route to immortality. But the danger of increasing one's fame is hubris.

								"Prophecies reveal paths that would otherwise be hidden to us\u2014paths which allow us to rise to our fate, rather than be destroyed by it. Such paths are often dangerous, and walking them may seem like madness, but that is the task of the mythic hero. To dismiss prophecy and spurn one's fate is hubris of the highest order."

Those who win fame by rising to their fate and honoring their oaths may be forced to make tragic sacrifices, but they will be happier in the end. On the other hand, those who turn from fate, break their oaths, and curse the gods will meet tragic endings, even if their lives are happier in the short run.",
								"In other words, mythic heroism means rising to the challenges that fate throws at you, even when the gods themselves work against you. It means losing yourself in the wilderness for decades, only to return in glory when your enemies least expect it. It also means betraying your loved ones, overthrowing rightful kings because of petty grievances, and discovering that you were a pawn of prophecy all along.",

They were forsaken by their gods, forced to live as beggars among the fey races.",

He could conjure apocalyptic storms with his right hand and cataclysmic earthquakes with his left hand. His sister-wife Lutheria held dominion over the land of dreams, and her voice was said to give life to the dead.",

Thousands of sacrifices were dedicated to the Lord of Storms, and libations of wine were poured to the Lady of Dreams at every meal. The twins were at first unswayed but, over time, they warmed to the persistent worship of the hapless settlers.",
										"In exchange for this devotion, the Titans offered the mortals oaths of protection, which shielded them from the worst ravages of the centaurs and cyclopes. The settlements survived, but they were always at the mercy of the Twins. So it remained for many hundreds of years."

Whenever any mortal settlement was razed to the ground by roving centaurs and cyclopes, the Dragonlords would repay the attackers in kind. Through harsh winters, blistering summers, and relentless assaults by the native races, the Dragonlords fought tirelessly, and the people of Thylea persevered.",

They were radiant to behold, bronze scales gleaming like fire. To be visited by one of the dragons was to be blessed; and nowhere was more blessed than the City of Mytros.",

But eventually, the Lady of Dreams grew bored with her insipid twin and began to play practical jokes on him. Sydon once demanded a chorus of voices be raised to celebrate the forging of his glaive. Lutheria captured hundreds of sirens and brought them before the throne demanding that they sing for her husband. They sang for days on end, until their voices were raw. When at last their voices gave out, they began to transform into hideous harpies. Sydon has never forgiven his sister for infesting his tower with the loathsome creatures, but Lutheria still laughs about it to this day."

As fate would have it, they discovered a magnificent bull that could pull a plow through any terrain for days without resting. Using the bull's great strength, they were able to produce bountiful crops with which to survive the first winter.",
												"Over time, the people of the tribe began to venerate the bull, crowning him as the god of the harvest. When Sydon learned of this, he was furious. He threw curses down upon the settlers and transformed them into bulls, in mockery of their insolence. Each of them was harnessed to a plow and forced to tread the same winding, geometric path, until that path became a deep, labyrinthian gorge. Eventually, the plows broke, and the people of Minos slowly began to stand upright again\u2014but their faces had been forever changed by the curse.",
												"The people of the tribe came to be called {@italic minotaurs}\u2014the bulls of Minos\u2014and they have never fully shed their bull-like demeanors. Some of them merely have horns and a snout-like nose, while others have the entire upper torso of a bull. Some continued to dwell in the labyrinth, while others left to explore the far reaches of Thylea. Over the centuries, they have come to view their own cursed existence as the will of the Fates."

Bad days, on the other hand, may see her moaning and wailing and dragging her feet."

										"The sirens once lived on a great expanse of shoals in the Cerulean Gulf, where they built a city of brilliant white limestone. Its towering spires and pillars thrust out from the rocky waters, allowing the sirens to fly or swim as they pleased. They lived here in joy, singing praises to Sydon, who governed the oceans. Sydon heard this from his throne in Praxys and scowled. \"Were they truly grateful, they would not build their towers to rival mine.\"",
										"When the sirens learned that Sydon was displeased, they were heartbroken. They dismantled their towers and composed new melodies\u2014songs of repentance\u2014which once more carried on the winds to the ears of the Titan. He was unmoved. \"Were they truly repentant, they would not sing so brazenly, but they would go meekly and offer the proper sacrifices in place of songs.\"",
										"This time, the sirens were utterly stricken. They had believed that their songs were cherished by the gods. Their voices were stilled, and in the ensuing silence, the brilliance of the city faded into shadow. Stone foundations cracked, and pediments grew heavy. The pillars collapsed, and the city of the sirens sank deep into the ocean, swallowed by churning waters. Even its name was forgotten.",
										"Centuries passed in silence. Eventually, a new song began\u2014an endless lamentation for the city that now sleeps on the ocean floor. When Lutheria learned that the city of the sirens had been destroyed, she laughed. She captured an entire flock of the pitiful creatures and gleefully cursed them, twisting them into something monstrous. These were the first harpies."

Accordingly, she created her own pantheon of Titans, including the Twins, Sydon and Lutheria. Thylea granted Sydon dominion over the oceans and charged him with guarding the islands from any mortal intrusion. Lutheria was granted dominion over the forests, and she was charged with guarding the islands against other gods. Thylea, however, failed to anticipate the incredible burden that this would place on Lutheria's mind. Gods and demons from other worlds have attempted to probe the islands for thousands of years, and over time, this has driven Lutheria mad."

She reached out\u2014silent as ever\u2014and brushed against her mad husband's mind, soothing his tortured spirit with a soft caress. Sensing her presence, the hundred-handed giant transformed his grief into a new purpose.

A virgin paradise, the Forgotten Land was kept safe from the perils and evils of the outside world by the giant Kentimane of the Hundred Hands\u2014Thylea's lover and protector. And together, the two were content.",
										"But one day, the tree at the center of the islands\u2014the transformed heart of the Mother Goddess herself\u2014blossomed with seven strange fruits. Each the size of a boulder, they shimmered and pulsed with vibrant, shifting colors, almost as if alive. Seeing the tempting bounty sprouting from the branches, Kentimane reached from the ocean and plucked the fruit. His fifty heads gorged themselves on the succulent flesh, tearing and chewing until all that remained were seven spike-covered pits, which he tossed into the ocean.",
										"Instead of sinking, the pits floated on the waves, bobbing up and down. Offended by their taunting presence, Kentimane seized each pit in a clenched fist, squeezing so hard the spikes bit into his flesh and drew blood. Howling in rage, Kentimane slammed the pits down beneath the water, burying them deep beneath the muddy bottom of the ocean floor.",
										"But the next morning the pits floated back up to the surface. Before Kentimane could seize them again, the pits burst open and the children of Thylea and Kentimane sprang forth into existence.",
										"The hundred-handed god stared in wonder at his offspring: eight Titans born from the fruit of Thylea's tree, fertilized by the blood of Kentimane himself. Each of the first six pits had incubated a single child blessed with a different attribute drawn from one of their parents: Strength; Beauty; Wisdom; Craft; Prophecy and Swiftness. As these six Titans grew from children into adults, they became demi-gods, each representing the aspect of their parents they most embodied.",
										"However, from the seventh pit two Titans were born: Sydon and Lutheria, twin brother and sister. Sydon embodied his father's raging fury, and as he grew he became the God of Time and the Lord of Storms. His sister, Lutheria, inherited her mother's stillness and calm... but without Thylea's compassion or gentleness, she would eventually become the Goddess of Death and the Lady of Dreams.",
										"But all this was far in the future, and Kentimane did not foresee what his offspring would one day become. He could not imagine the strife and suffering the Twins would bring to the peaceful islands. If he had known, he might have drowned them on the spot. But instead, he scooped up his children from the waves\u2014including Sydon and Lutheria\u2014and placed them gently at the base of the great Heart-Tree rising up from the center of the island, where Thylea could watch over them.",

Of all the Titans, only Sydon and Lutheria, his youngest siblings, refused: they were united by the powerful bond, and did not feel the empty loneliness of their kin.",

										"Weakened by his sister's adulation, Talieus did as he was bade and the myrmekes were born. An industrious, insect-like race with a shared hive-mind intelligence, the myrmekes quickly spread out from their isolated home, overwhelming and conquering the native species on nearby islands.",
										"The other Titans condemned Talieus for creating such aggressive and dangerous creatures. Talieus, burning with parental pride, refused act against his newest children. It fell to Sydon, the God of Storms, to halt the myrmekes' advance. As they piled into their ships, he unleashed the fury of the sea, dashing their vessels to smithereens with howling winds, drowning them beneath the waves. Even Sydon could not halt their advance forever. The other Titans, fearful the myrmekes would continue to spread, begged their father for help. Moved by the fears of his children, Kentimane used his hundred hands to gather all the myrmekes onto a single island. Calling on the strength of Thylea herself, he bound them there with powerful magic so they could never leave.",

Then she bound his power to her crystal scythe and forced him to wander eternally in the Nether Sea, dragging her throne-ship across the waves behind him by a great chain strapped around his neck.",

But Sydon had absorbed much of the enslaved Talieus' power, and he easily bested his challenger. Sydon imprisoned the defeated Hergeron beneath a great tower, chaining him to so that the full weight of the building was forever pressing down on Hergeron's enormous neck and shoulders.",
										"The remaining four siblings, realizing Sydon had grown too powerful to challenge directly, decided to strike at Lutheria. In secret, they traveled to her island but the Goddess of Death had set a trap for her kin. Through the ritual sacrifice of a thousand basilisks, she had created a great pool of poisonous blood at the heart of her domain. When the invaders set foot upon the island they triggered wards of power that released the magic of the foul pool in a lethal burst, instantly turning three of them to stone. Only Chalcia, the Goddess of Swiftness, was nimble enough to escape.",
										"Knowing the Twins would come after her, Chalcia took shelter beneath a massive volcano. There she could use her speed and quickness to survive in the labyrinth of tunnels and lava tubes. When Sydon learned of the failed attack against his sister-wife, his fury knew no bounds. In a blind rage, he summoned a great storm to lash all the islands of Thylea, seeking to flood the chambers where Chalcia was hiding.",
										"The storms threatened to wash away Thylea itself, something that Kentimane would not allow. Kentimane had stayed neutral in the battles of his children but, once the safety of all of Thylea became threatened, he was forced to intervene. Kentimane blunted the storms, and he forbade Sydon and Lutheria from destroying the volcano that sheltered their fugitive sister. Sydon was loathe to let Chalcia escape retribution, but even he was not strong enough to defy his mighty father. Lutheria, cunning as ever, knew of another way to get revenge.",
										"Uniting their power, and the power stolen from their fallen siblings, the Twins reached deep into the foundation of Thylea. They shifted rock and stone, careful not to disturb the islands above as they sealed off the tunnels and chambers beneath the volcano one by one.",

In the end, the elusive Goddess of Swiftness found herself trapped in a tiny chamber at the very heart of the volcano itself. With every exit sealed, the walls slowly closed in tighter and tighter as burning lava oozed through cracks and crevices in floor and ceiling. Instead of crushing her, the Twins stopped at the last instant, entombing their sister for all eternity in a crypt of searing heat and noxious fumes."

Ages passed, and the dead Titans were forgotten by the children they had created. As far as history remembered, the Twin Titans were the authors of all.",
										"But the remote continent birthed from their mother could not remain hidden forever. As the centuries passed, the so-called civilized races, humans, elves, dwarves and their like, began to stumble across the islands at the far reaches of the Forgotten Sea. The first to arrive were refugees and castaways, survivors of ships gone astray. Half-drowned, they crawled onto island shores and carved out a meager existence among the native fey races.",
										"Sydon ignored these newcomers. They were too weak and pathetic to acknowledge. Lutheria found something compelling in their nature. When others came, the explorers and settlers, she stayed Sydon's fury and allowed them to land safely so she could study these strange folk. As their numbers grew, the civilized races established small villages along the coasts. Bit by bit, they spread across the islands of Thylea, until their numbers brought them into conflict with the original inhabitants.",

They lacked the power to resist the magic tricks and temptations of the nymphs, dryads and satyrs. Everything changed with the arrival of the Dragonlords, a band of heroes who fought astride great winged mounts.",

Joining them were Adonis Neurdagon, beautiful and vain; the brothers Telamok and Estor Arkelandor, ruthless and savage warriors; and several others who have since been forgotten. Each warrior was oathsworn to a dragon, and together, they were nigh unstoppable in battle.",

At his sister's urging, Sydon ignored the pleading of his worshippers to cleanse Thylea of the invaders. Under the leadership of the Dragonlords, the civilized races entered an age of unprecedented expansion.",

He promised a future in which the so-called civilized species had utter dominance over Thylea and the fey creatures.",
										"Mortals of all races flocked to his banner. He built fortresses and walled cities to protect his followers from attack, the foundation of what would one day become the great kingdom of Mytros. The ranks of his armies, under the command of his younger brother Estor, swelled.",
										"For Telamok, war was merely a tool, a way to build and secure the future of his people. Estor, however, cared little for the future. He had no desire to rule or govern, and his only joy was battle. Most, including his dragon, thought he was a brave hero, seeking glory. The truth was far worse, for war was the only way that Estor could satisfy his bloodlust and cruelty. His victories on the battlefield meant nothing beyond the chance of slaughter and carnage.",
										"As Telamok's kingdom grew, it expanded into gygan territory. Knowing the one-eyed, six-armed giants would not welcome outsiders, he commanded Estor to lead his army against them. In Telamok's mind, his brother would break the gygan ranks and force the giants to bend the knee. Estor, however, had other plans.",
										"Riding on his dragon, he led the charge that routed the gygans. The giants fought bravely, but were no match for the Dragonlord and his mount. Once they knew the battle was lost, they threw down their weapons in surrender. Estor refused to take prisoners, and refused to parley. To the horror of his noble dragon mount, he ordered his troops to massacre every single gygan warrior.",

Estor's dragon begged him to show mercy, but he was deaf to her pleas. His army massacred mothers and children, the old and the infirm. Only a handful of gygans escaped to warn the other fey folk of Estor's atrocities.",

Seeing the slaughter, Lutheria finally recognized the threat the newcomers posed, and she released Sydon from his vow to not harm them.

The crew of the {@italic Ultros} ravaged the islands of Thylea, leaving slaughter in their wake. Sydon threw everything against the vessel, trying to smash it with hundred-foot waves or drag it down to the bottom of the sea. The magic of the {@italic Ultros} was so powerful even the God of Storms couldn't sink it.",
										"With Sydon's failure, it fell to Lutheria to find a way to end Estor's reign of terror. She approached the barbaric Captain in a dream: if Estor swore to end his massacres against her children, she would give him and his crew eternal life by ritual magic. Estor was naturally wary of a trap, particularly when approached by a naked goddess in his dreams, but he knew that he was safe on the Ultros. Even the Goddess of Death could not harm him. Seduced by the Goddess, he woke from his dream and slit the throats of his officers as a blood sacrifice to begin her immortality ritual.",
										"Lutheria came to him on a cold wind, swooping in from void of a moonless night to land on the deck of the Ultros. The Captain, as Estor now styled himself, was enchanted by her cold, cruel beauty and lay with the Goddess to consummate the arrangement. The two were surrounded by the leering corpses of his butchered men.",
										"As the first rays of sun climbed over the horizon, Lutheria vanished. The officers that Estor had murdered rose to their feet. Though all knew how Estor had betrayed them, Lutheria's ritual bound them to his will. When they saluted their Captain, Estor let out a great, roaring laugh. He knew he had been blessed by Lutheria and would never die.",
										"The blessing of the Goddess of Death soon revealed its nature as a curse. Estor and his crew could not die, but they still felt pain: wounds would not kill them, but neither would they heal. Instead, they festered and rotted. Age could not touch them, but they felt the ravages of disease and illness. Lutheria was true to her word: as the years turned to decades and then centuries, they did not die. They endured as twisted and disfigured creatures, trapped in a world between life and death as they were slowly driven mad.",
										"After centuries of torment, Estor and his crew tried to break Lutheria's curse with a second ritual. They sought the release of death, but the Mistress of Death would not grant them peace.
