				"The alchemist's furnace is a device that transmutes one material into another. Every transformation brings the material infinitesimally closer to perfection.",
				"The function of the furnace is not simply the manufacture of potions, acids, alchemist's fire, and other alchemical concoctions. Those mundane pursuits can be accomplished on any workbench. The furnace exists to aid the alchemist in nothing less than unlocking the mysteries of the material and spiritual universe.",
				"The discipline of alchemy is built upon rigorous reasoning. A common misunderstanding is that alchemists are interested in turning lead into gold in order to make themselves rich. Everyone would like to be rich, but that's not what drives alchemists in their quest for gold. Their reasoning goes like this:",

						"Lead is a base metal. Although it's useful, it's ugly and has little value. This is because lead is imperfect and impure.",

						"If lead could be cleansed of its impurities\u2014if its imperfections could be made more perfect\u2014its nature would also be perfected and it would become gold."

				"Alchemy must be understood on those terms. It's not a search for wealth, it's a search for perfection. And it's not limited to metals. All things come in grades of perfection. Quartz is imperfect; a diamond nears perfection. A grape is imperfect; aged wine nears perfection. Knotty pine is imperfect; white oak nears perfection. What's true of minerals and plants can also be true of animals. A rat is imperfect; an Andalusian horse nears perfection. If it's true of lesser animals, it can also be true of people. If metal can be perfected, and the grape can be perfected, and the rat can be perfected, then why not a person? Perfection of the human spirit is the alchemist's true and ultimate goal. Learning to transmute (or purify) lead into gold is only the first step in that process. (And of course, the transformation must be permanent, not temporary as with the transmutation wizard's {@subclassFeature Minor Alchemy|Wizard|PHB|Transmutation|PHB|2|PHB} class feature.)",
				"The alchemist's furnace aids that process. Heat and pressure perfect coal into diamonds, cold perfects water into ice, flame perfects wood into charcoal, sunlight and water perfect the acorn into the oak.

After {@dice 1d10} days, it unlocks and its contents can be removed.",
						"The controls on the furnace are tremendously varied and complex, with possible settings running into the hundreds of millions.",
						"For the desired transmutation to occur successfully, the alchemist overseeing the project must make a successful Intelligence check. The DC for the check depends on the desired effect. Sample DCs are listed on the Transformations table. If characters decide to experiment, the GM will probably need to make several judgment calls. The overseeing character's proficiency bonus can be added if the character is trained in the use of alchemy tools, and the number of previous attempts at this same transmutation can be added as a bonus on the roll.",

The furnace might release toxic gas when it opens, it might create an angry quasit or manes instead of the desired item, or it might explode and blow everyone into atoms.",
						"The severity of the mishap should increase directly with the DC of the transformation being attempted.",
						"It's also possible for a mishap to produce a serendipitous result. If the Intelligence check result is one lower than the DC or is a natural 20 but still a failure, the furnace produces something different from the desired item but still useful or interesting.

A partially used bezoar recharges itself after being out of a body for 24 hours. Swallowing it again after that allows a new roll for duration. You can only have one bezoar active at a time, and while one is active, you do not gain any benefit from other consumable magic items, such as potions. While uncomfortable, this doesn't impact your ability to eat and drink though.",

You can't remove a cursed bezoar before its full duration (when you will regurgitate it as normal) unless you are first targeted by a {@spell remove curse} spell. However, if the bezoar is not removed before your next short or long rest after the spell's casting, the curse returns. The curse ends automatically once the bezoar is regurgitated."

As Maksilov fled westward, she heard rumors of the Scarlet Citadel and the legendary alchemical engine buried beneath it. She found the furnace idle and ignored, and she persuaded {@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC} to let her study it in exchange for potions that could calm the voices in his head.",

Mishaps in some of her early experiments (that she misinterpreted as unforeseen successes) produced ooze-like substances. She became convinced ooze was the key to reconstructing {@i prima materia} (the primordial building block of {@i everything}), and all her research has gone down that path ever since.",

She might be willing to talk to martial-type characters and even to clerics and druids (with reservations), but her paranoia over intellectual theft eventually derails any conversation with a practitioner of the arcane. Even then, she has little patience for talk about anything other than alchemy and oozes.",

It was generated spontaneously inside the furnace during a transmutation that was a failure in all other respects. {@creature Bastronombecqua|KPSC|Bastron} is technically a demon but it has never been to the Abyss or spent any time around other demons.

								"{@i The Scarlet Citadel} is a relatively straightforward adventure for players and the GM, but levels of the complex are connected both by key story elements and stairs. You'll also need to understand the relationships between inhabitants to get the most from this material.",
								"The unifying villain of the Scarlet Citadel is {@creature Gellert the Gruesome|KPSC}, last (or nearly last) scion of the noble family of Holzanger, who built the citadel and once ruled the surrounding territory. Gellert dwells deep in the catacombs, where he can conduct his research on Void magic and the manipulation of ley energy in perfect seclusion. He's not, however, entirely cut off from the world. Powerful figures on other levels of the dungeon serve as his lieutenants in the underworld and as his liaisons to the surface world. Everything living beneath the Scarlet Citadel fears Gellert's power to one extent or another, though few have ever met the legendary sorcerer face-to-face.",

Over the decades it has been used as a hideout by bandits and as a base of operations for adventurers exploring the area. Currently, it's been taken over by harpies that live in the basement of the main keep. They drive away most would-be heroes and sometimes terrorize nearby farms and logging camps. The harpies also throw their scraps to the owlbears that prowl the territory. The occasional presence of those predators contributes to keeping the crumbling fort free of curious interlopers."

Unsurprisingly, in a world where rocs and dragons are real security concerns, the underground portion of the fortress was more extensive than the aboveground works. The current chief occupants of this level are a psychotic, sadistic torturer and serial killer known locally as {@creature the Gaoler|KPSC}, along with a handful of equally twisted creatures that serve him. {@creature The Gaoler|KPSC} has no connection with {@creature Gellert the Gruesome|KPSC}, who tolerates his presence as a deterrent to explorers.",
												"Beyond {@creature the Gaoler|KPSC}'s chambers are ancient crypts of the Holzanger family. This section is rife with undead, thanks to a weak spot in the dimensional barrier between Midgard and the Dry Lands. That realm's corruption seeped into the crypts for centuries and worked its foul magic on the remains interred here. Even {@creature the Gaoler|KPSC} avoids the crypts and guards against incursions from wandering undead."

The monographs buried here date back to the earliest years of the Holzanger residency and even to the time of the elves who predated them. In his quest to restore the heavily damaged manuscripts, {@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC} has become a master of time-manipulating magic. He is also a loyal vassal and apprentice of {@creature Gellert the Gruesome|KPSC}, since {@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC}'s arcane interests overlap Gellert's areas of study. When Gellert needs to be represented on the surface, {@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC} is the person he's most likely to send as his agent.",

She's managed to assemble an impressive laboratory for her studies, which also involve propagating novel species of her favorite creatures with unique properties.",
												"Finally, a scavenging band of dust goblins has crept into this level, unbeknown to {@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC} and Maksilov. They're discreetly exploring, mapping the level's layout, and spying on its inhabitants with admirable caution while they size up the prospects for plunder."

All one hundred dwarves of the warband (which included not only soldiers of fortune but also owlbear trainers and a few skilled ring mages) resided in these spacious barracks styled after the great subterranean halls of their homeland.",
												"When the aboveground portion of the Scarlet Citadel was overthrown and sacked by the knights of Khors 110 years ago, the dwarves stayed on, secure in their underground fortress with their ring magic and specially bred dire owlbears\u2014or so they believed. But trollkin knew about the barracks. A few had even been hired as heavy laborers during construction, and that proved a fatal mistake for the dwarves. After a protracted siege to weaken the dwarves, the trollkin assaulted the fortifications with fierce determination. Gate by gate, room by room, barricade by barricade, the trollkin battered, smashed, mined, and burned their way through the stronghold until every dwarf was slain and the magnificent halls were theirs.",
												"A handful of trollkin still live here. They pledge no fealty to {@creature Gellert the Gruesome|KPSC}, but they fear him and his lieutenants {@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC} and {@creature Imortra the Debased|KPSC}, who control the levels above and below this one, respectively.",
												"Because of the dungeon's layout, characters are unlikely to find an entrance to the lower three levels that doesn't involve coming through this level. That means they must either kill all the trollkin or strike some sort of deal with them for safe passage. The first option won't be easy, but it might be more attainable than the second. If the trollkin aren't destroyed or bribed generously, they'll be a deadly threat to the explorers' only line of retreat."

Other than their fearsome high priest, cult members tend to be maimed and degenerated examples of humanoid stock. The bats, however, are healthy and savage. These creatures have nothing to do with Gellert, and he takes little interest in them.",

She is an elfmarked diabolist who shares Gellert's interest in the Void and sometimes helps directly in his research. Imortra commands several devils of significant power and can call more when needed.",

They provide her some amount of security (supplementing her indentured devils) and bring her humanoid captives gathered from far and wide to serve as menial laborers and test subjects.",

What they didn't know was the fortress also sat atop a stretch of the Black River (the term applied by cultists of Charun to shadow roads). Ironically, this section of shadow road coincides with a subterranean river, making the cult's metaphoric label literally true in this locale. In the manner of most theologically driven zealots, the cultists fixated on that accident of nature and invested it with an importance far beyond its simple symbolic coincidence. They carved a temple to their dark god into the caverns surrounding the river and set about their grim worship.",
												"Eventually, the cultists discovered the Howling Halls beneath their temple, and the head of the cult was drawn to investigate Void magic. He entered into an alliance of convenience with Void cultists, and soon they were as numerous in the temple as followers of Charun. Conflicts followed inevitably, until eventually the Void cultists declared the temple theirs and made it clear Charun's adherents were not welcome and wouldn't be tolerated.",
												"Even the Void cultists couldn't hold the temple forever. Other creatures coveted what the cultists had and challenged them for possession of the site. The Void cult defended its shrine for decades, but the enemy was persistent and patient. The only cultists who remain now are undead, and they share the halls and the river with demons, water trolls, and other aquatic monstrosities.",
												"Despite such fearsome neighbors, one resident is the undisputed master of this level: {@creature Gellert the Gruesome|KPSC}. He confines himself mostly to his residence and to the few locales that hold interest for his research into ley lines, shadow roads, and the Void, leaving the other denizens of the caverns to do as they please."

It pulls terrific wind through the twisting, elementally-charged tunnels of the labyrinth. The sphere's connection to the Void makes it of great interest to {@creature Gellert the Gruesome|KPSC}. Ideally, he'd like to find a way to take control of it, but that goal has eluded him for four decades. Meanwhile, the Howling Halls surrounding the sphere are flooded with elemental energy, making them by far the most dangerous places in the entire dungeon complex."

Sometimes it does, but not always; it depends on the situation.",
										"{@skill Investigation} represents a character's ability to collate bits of information into a specific conclusion.

They could opt to trigger the trap from a distance by tossing a stick onto the wire, but that's risky without knowing what will happen. Another example would be holes in the wall with scorch marks around them; flames must shoot out of those holes. Characters don't know what triggers the trap, but they can avoid the flames by crawling under the holes or by plugging them up.",
								"In these situations, characters can learn more about the trap by interacting with it carefully (while asking you questions). If they're still unsure what to do, they can attempt an Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check at the original DC to get a clearer understanding.

Don't check separately for each area, just estimate how long the search takes and make one roll. Most rooms can be scanned this way in a minute or so.",
								"If a trap has no visible features\u2014no tripwire, no spikes protruding from the ceiling, no scorch marks on the wall, no bloodstains on the floor\u2014{@skill Perception} is much less useful. These situations are made for {@skill Investigation}.",
								"{@skill Investigation} requires an active search. Actively investigating a 5-foot-square area of floor or a 5-foot section of wall takes one character 1 minute. This may seem like a long time, but the characters' lives may depend on this search being thorough! It's not something to rush through.",
								"{@skill Investigation} of a large area should be resolved with a single skill check, but it still takes 1 minute for every 5-by-5 floor square and 1 minute for every 5 feet of wall length. Thoroughly investigating a 25-foot-square room, for example, takes about 40 minutes (25 minutes for the floor plus 20 minutes for the walls minus a few minutes to account for obvious doorways).",
								"The time can be shortened by having multiple characters search different areas. In that case, each searcher makes an independent Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check for their own area.",
								"{@skill Investigation} reveals more than {@skill Perception} does. A successful Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check of a trap reveals the trigger and any understandable details about its effect. For example, the investigator might learn that stepping on {@i this} flagstone causes {@i that} wall panel to open, but it's impossible to know what's behind the wall panel without opening it. Successful investigation of a secret door reveals the door's location and how to open it.",
								"{@skill Perception} isn't useless in these situations, but all a successful Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check produces is a suspicion about the area, a knowing that something in it is {@i wrong}. There could be traps, or concealed doors, or something else entirely. To get more information, characters must explore more fully.",

								"Despite the lack of travel, Gerhardt's private ley line offered strength and the seemingly boundless ability to study, learn, and tinker, delighting first Gerhardt and then his progeny (his wife was one Edelfrieda the Golden, said to be a druid, a sorceress, or an elfmarked petty noble of Dornig\u2014some insist on all three). Within the reach of the White Forest, first Gerhardt the Elder and then Gerhardt the Younger and then Gertruda and Gunthar and Gerhardt III all had control over the ley lines, countering any foe or assassin skillfully, inventing new ways to charm a friend or turn an enemy into a bug. Over generations, their interests delved deep into newts and amphibians, and then the family became obsessed with horology, celestial mechanics, flotation and levitation, night creatures, angelic languages, and on and on. Always seeking knowledge purely to possess it, rarely using it to better their small barony or even to enrich themselves or their peasantry.",
								"For a brief period, the area was quasi-independent, and each Holzanger sorcerer styled himself the \"Baron of Citarossa, Lord of the White Forest, and Master of the Scarlet Citadel.\" So it went for nigh 200 years: always a tiny power, always independent, though sometimes paying tribute to one power or another, and always a strange little oddity known mostly to merchants, timberfolk, and the southern Magdar villages.",
								"However, their overweening pride and power drew attention, and in time, an unexpected arrival ended the first age of the citadel roughly 150 years ago."

								"The dwarves of the cantons and of the city-state of Melana are makers, forgers of steel, imbuing weapons with the power of Mavros and Svarog\u2014and even Ninkash and Rava\u2014and durable armor, enchanted barrels, and wondrous works in gold, steel, and stone. A few dwarves though, especially those of Nordmansch and Alpentor, still hew to the older ways, forging rings of surpassing power and loveliness, alive with the circling strength of runes, binding raw arcane might and turning it to fire and shadow, to glamours as durable as stone.",
								"These dwarves, the ring wardens and the ring mystics, are the keepers of lore said to have been handed down by bearded Wotan himself. Their understanding of embodying magic in physical form is rarely surpassed, and they took a keen interest in House Holzanger. When the human house was weak, they showed up one day, told Gerhardt III they would be his new soldiers and providers, and somehow either charmed him (some say the gift of an enchanted ring secured Gerhardt III's cooperation) or won him through bribery (others say the ring mystics shared their secrets of binding arcane essences into circular form and that Gerhardt himself forged dozens of powerful rings in this manner).",
								"In either case, suddenly there was a company of one hundred dwarves and a half-dozen ring mages in the village of Redleaf\u2014and many arguments with the locals over the paucity of ale and proper sausages. The dwarves chased down and tamed owlbears as hunting animals and guardians for the newly built Dwarf Hall in the village, a fine dwarven-style structure with a lookout tower. A palisade was raised to protect the village from woodland raiders. And relations between villagers and dwarves never improved. The dwarves followed Ninkash a bit too closely, often drunk and pissing in the streets or singing their endless songs late at night. The dwarven hall was a bit too fine and too imposing. Brawls were common, though the humans had much the worst of it. Complaints to Baron Gerhardt went unheeded. The owlbears ate local goats and chickens and even a beloved dog.",
								"One night, while most of the dwarves were digging at the old Scarlet Manor Hall, the Dwarf Hall burned to the ground. The streets of the village of Redleaf glowed brightly, and the humans sang their own songs of Khors. Some of the Redleaf druids and doughtier men-at-arms mused about throwing the dwarves out entirely and \"rescuing\" Baron Gerhardt from their evil influences.",
								"Baron Gerhardt finally saw the danger of further strife between the humans and dwarves. He called the dwarves to stay at the manor house and keep and told them to build it into a finer citadel with a new name: the Scarlet Citadel. The owlbears left the village of Redleaf to live with the dwarves, coming to the riverside village only occasionally when the baron's dwarves came calling. These grim-faced dwarves came twice a year to collect taxes or gather up barrels of ale from Peltzenheim or to send furs to their dwarven brothers in Melana and Brescia. The dungeons beneath the Scarlet Citadel were vastly expanded and improved to include owlbear stables, barracks, shrines to dwarven gods, and a vast library and workspace carved out for the Holzangers.",
								"The dwarves brought more than rings and owlbears to the Scarlet Citadel. They also brought the faith of Charun the Boatman with them from Melana, and over time, they connected some elements of the citadel with the Black River of Tears, sacred to Charun and said to be a source of connection between the mortal world and Yggdrasil or between Midgard and the many realms of the outer planes."

								"About 130 years ago, the dwarves of the Scarlet Citadel grew impatient with what seemed like plentiful coin and ale, plus the fine magical treasures they occasionally gained from the Holzangers. Tired of hunting and guarding and drinking, and led by the canny Captain {@creature Chansar the Pale|KPSC}, they began to take empty carts pulled by enormous tamed owlbears out to the Schio-Wagenstein Road where they plundered merchants and rolled away with fine steel from Melana, copper bars, leather hides from Trombei, spices from Triolo, barrels of salt fish from Friula, and strings of Septime coin. This banditry was small at first\u2014a trader here, a lone peddler there\u2014but it quickly grew into a business of serious danger for trade between the Seven Cities and the Crossroads.",
								"Trade is always dangerous of course, especially among the Septime cities, so the usual precautions were taken. Merchants hired guards, which slowed the banditry but made some trade quite difficult; the price of salt fish won't support a squadron of lancers. Rewards were posted.",
								"For years, various cantonal dwarves and the dwarves of Melana were blamed, for the canny dwarves of the Scarlet Citadel displayed shields and banners of Tijino, Juralt, and Melana or of famous mercenary companies within the Seven Cities. In time, however, it became clear these dwarves lived to the east of the road, and they operated from some stronghold in the White Forest. Given the notorious strength of the forest's owlbears and the well-known dangers of the sorcerers of the Scarlet Citadel taking offense at trespassers, the merchants all agreed that someone else should seek out the bandit stronghold and put a stop to the whole mess. The rewards grew larger.",
								"The end of the bandit era came in a different way when canny Captain Chansar bragged a bit too loudly at Redleaf's tavern, the Cage. A young squire of the Faithful Knights of Khors was visiting the village as part of a simple devotional journey to the shrine there, and she overheard this boasting about pillaging a full mule train, so Squire Emmalyn told her sergeant of the bragging dwarven bandit. The paladins and faithful knights of Khors had recently had one of their own wine shipments from the Smolten Hills plundered by bandits, and the order's commander was incensed. A wing of knights, a squad of the Wands of Khors battle mages, and the high priest of Khors in Zigistad himself all followed the young squire Emmalyn into the White Forest to Redleaf village and then to the citadel.",
								"When the dwarves refused to hand over Captain Chansar and his accomplices to the king's justice and the mercy of Khors, the knights laid siege to the citadel for a month. In time, owlbears within the citadel ate all there was to eat, and canny Chansar sent the starving beasts out the citadel gate, expecting to make short work of the knights. He was quite mistaken; High Priest Tadeas Toller struck the owlbears with holy fire, the Wands of Khors unleashed lightning, and the countercharge carried the knights into the citadel courtyard.",
								"The battle might yet have gone to the dwarves with their crossbows firing into the courtyard from well- built arrow slits if not for the fine timbers of the keep catching fire when a lucky fireball went through an arrow slit into the interior. The Scarlet Citadel floors, stairs, rafters, and tapestries burned bright and strong, and the conflagration quickly poured smoke into the buildings, the dungeons, and the courtyard. It became impossible to shoot through the smoke and soon to breathe within the tower. The smoke and flames drove a few dwarves into the deeper tunnels, though most were forced to surrender to the waiting company of knights. Captain Chansar's body was never found, and his ring mystic lieutenant Valence Hellhand is known to have survived and fled to Nordmansch. The citadel walls still stood, blackened with smoke, and the dungeons below were no longer home to dozens of owlbears.",
								"But the age of the Scarlet Citadel as a functional fortress was over and done, and the cracked, blackened mortar and missing rafters meant the walls themselves were weakened. Soon other inhabitants came to the citadel, and the villagers of Redleaf came to gather up useful stone blocks and take them by wagon to reinforce their own keep and palisade. These scarlet stones were carried for miles and used with care. And one morning, a mysterious red tower was erected, making such a fine impression overlooking the village, which was soon renamed Redtower, and it has kept that name ever since."

								"The sack of the Scarlet Citadel affected the village of Redtower very little indeed. Timber was still cut, some logs rafted down to Triolo to build the fleets, many of the finest timbers going north to the Magdar plain for houses, barrels\u2014all the things for which stout oak, maple, and ash are most prized. A few arcanists came to sniff around at the ruins, though most left quickly once they met the feral owlbears or were vexed by the sprites and pixies and alseid who guarded the forest paths against intruders.",
								"However, one group came not by forest path but by shadow road, powered by the Wandering Crow ley line. These were the cultists of Charun, the boatman between the living and the dead, whose followers took a pilgrimage from Kammae-Straboli along the Black River (as they call their temples' shadow roads) and wound up underneath the citadel. The whole company of pilgrims was quite confused at first, but the shadow-fey wizard Quendreth the  Wise immediately saw the power and strange geomantic convergence of the site. He insisted a shrine be built immediately, and he brought in shadow-fey guards and mages to embed it with power and bind the ley line.",
								"The small community could not find its way back to Kammae via the river, but with Quendreth's help, they did establish shadow-river connections far and wide, both deep into the Shadow Realm and to the three titanic ley lines to the west, north, and southeast. Sometimes the Black River flowed south, powered the Wandering Crow to the White Road and thus to Revskaya, Raguza, Achillon, and occasionally Harkesh. Other seasons brought connections west and north to Brescia and St. Mischau along the shadow road, and once even to Zobeck. The most difficult connections were those along the Pontoretto, sometimes to Trombei and sometimes as far as Capleon. Charun's faithful used the Black River connection quietly and without fuss, retaining it as a secret of the deeper initiates of the Temple of Charun. And even to those who never traveled the shadow rivers, it knit the community together with a physical embodiment of their faith, though only Quendreth truly seemed to understand how to pilot a vessel to connect the shadow roads, a secret he shared with no others. Or at least with no humans.",
								"With the cult of Charun ensconced in the lower levels of the citadel, trading with inhabitants of the underworld and using the ley line to strengthen its presence from the Seven Cities to the heart of the Dragon Empire, things changed. The arcane power of the Holzangers was passed to the Boatman's followers. Quendreth was suddenly held in high esteem among the congregants who had once made their pilgrimages entirely on the surface world, and he was granted the title of Ferryman within the church. A period of fifteen years kept him at the forefront of Charun's works over a vast territory.",
								"Alas, Quendreth was as susceptible to hubris and arrogance as many of the shadow fey, and he dabbled in Void magic, opening portals to other planes entirely, speaking to demons and devils, and inviting the satarre priestess Miskra ai-Vellec to advise him. This went about as well as you might expect, for even a less zealous priestess such as Miskra was delighted to have such power in her hands\u2014a tool for her own plans\u2014though she also shared much lore with Quendreth, and the two were allies of convenience for a decade. In time though, the satarre Void cultists and the true believers of Charun fell out with each other, but not before Miskra realized she could use the waters of the Black River for certain dark rituals and malign enchantments. In time, the Void cult arrived in force, and Quendreth was forced to leave quickly.",
								"When the shadow-fey wizard departed, he did {@i something} to the ley line that entirely removed its ability to easily connect to the Pontoretto or the shadow road, and its connection to the White Road remained spotty at best. At the same time, Quendreth brought one of the Holzangers back to the Scarlet Citadel\u2014the child of Gerhardt IV\u2014to hold the place and the White Forest in perpetuity (more precisely until their return). He was called Gerhardt the Changeling and had a definite elfmarked look to him. He lived for one hundred years, and at age 70, he took a human wife from Raguza, said to be a pirate captain and certainly a hellraiser. Her name was Melanchia the Reaver, and {@creature Gellert the Gruesome|KPSC} is her son."

								"Approaching Redtower from the northwest goes through lowland prairie toward the White Forest where Redtower is nestled within the tree line. A wooden palisade surrounds most of the town with platforms and small watchtowers attached to the palisade at each entrance.

A small tributary of the Templine flows from the southwest to the northeast on the far side of town.",

While predatory, these adventure peddlers are not lying about the dangers of the citadel: everyone in Redtower knows few who venture into the citadel ever return.",

								"The topmost level of the dungeon houses the long-disused Holzanger family crypts and a series of chambers that used to be the castle's final fallback bunkers. Those bunkers have become the lair of a creature known in the area as \"{@creature the Gaoler|KPSC},\" while the crypts are overrun with undead creatures thanks to an open portal to the Dry Lands.",
								"{@creature The Gaoler|KPSC} is an infamous kidnapper and torturer. He preys on isolated travelers journeying through the region and on the citizens of Redtower, where he's invoked by {@condition frightened} villagers as a local demonic bogeyman. (See {@adventure the appendix|KPSC|10} for the full description of {@creature the Gaoler|KPSC} and his stats.)",
								"{@creature The Gaoler|KPSC} doesn't work alone. He has an assistant\u2014a tusked crimson ogre called {@creature Scar|KPSC}\u2014and a compatriot of sorts, a human blood cultist named {@creature Ushulx|KPSC} (see {@adventure appendix|KPSC|10} for both), who is here for her own reasons. She aids {@creature the Gaoler|KPSC} just enough to keep him from turning against her. In exchange, he hands his victims over to her when they are on death's door so she can sacrifice their last whispers of life to Charun. Unlike {@creature the Gaoler|KPSC} and {@creature Scar|KPSC}, {@creature Ushulx|KPSC} can be reasoned with\u2014from a position of power. Characters might strike a bargain with her, if they're willing to leave her alone in exchange for her not interfering with them as they come and go.",
								"While there are only three enemies in this portion of the dungeon, they all have a CR of 2 or 3. If they manage to team up against a standard-size 1st-level party, things could go very badly for the adventurers. This doesn't mean you should go easy on them, but make sure they understand a small party can bite off more than they can chew in the Scarlet Citadel. If they devise ways to turn {@creature the Gaoler|KPSC}'s traps and torture devices to their own advantage, so much the better. There's also no shame in running away to regroup. Remember that none of these villains kill prisoners outright. {@creature The Gaoler|KPSC} and {@creature Scar|KPSC} want victims to torture, and {@creature Ushulx|KPSC} wants victims for a sacrifice. If someone is captured or left behind, a rescue is possible, as long as characters don't delay more than 48 hours before returning.",

Don't do it! Don't cheapen the players' victory by letting them win without a struggle. To prevail here, characters need to think tactically.

The dwarves found the strange features both fascinating and beautiful, so they took precautions and worked around them and even used them as burial grounds\u2014and hiding spots for valuable caches.

While the characters investigate, clacker beetles are slowly but surely surrounding them and getting ready to pounce.

They're spots where a wrinkle in space-time induced by the Black River allows reality to intersect itself so two locations exist in the same space. In this case, the second location is a distant, tropical sea teeming with quippers. For example, if a character extends their hand into one of the pools, their hand exists simultaneously here beneath the Scarlet Citadel and in that tropical sea hundreds of miles away. There's always only one hand, but it occupies two coinciding spaces at the same time.",
										"Characters might get a glimmer of this truth if they study the phenomenon. First, within moments of approaching the pool, characters notice dead fish lying among the moss under and around the pool. These fall into two categories: freshly dead fish (no more than a day old) and clean, scattered bones (that's all the clacker beetles leave behind). Anyone with {@skill Nature} proficiency recognizes most of the fish as {@creature quipper|MM|quippers} but an unfamiliar variety they've never seen in this part of the world.",

Other times, a fish or other sea creature (a squid, shark, or turtle for example) enters the pool the same way. The fish entering and leaving the pool must come from somewhere and go somewhere, and one logical assumption (though not the only one, in a magical world) is that via some mysterious mechanism, the water the characters see is part of a larger body of water the characters can't see.",
										"Alternatively, you can declare that at some point while characters are in this chamber or {@area Area 321|SC-321|x}, a fish swims out of the pool and drops to the floor, where it flops around gasping for air.",

This is dangerously deceptive; the pool is 300 feet below the surface of the sea.",

A character who enters the pool bodily must immediately make a successful {@dc 15} Constitution saving throw just to hold his or her breath. If that saving throw fails, all the air is squeezed from their lungs and they must either swim out of the pool or begin suffocating.",
														"The second problem is predators. Not everything in that sea is dangerous but {@creature reef shark|MM|reef sharks}, {@creature giant shark|MM|giant sharks}, and {@creature swarm of quippers|MM|quipper swarms} abound, along with any other sea creatures you add to the mix. Anyone who enters the sea should have to fight at least one hungry predator. If that fight leaves them bleeding, more predators appear.",
														"The final problem is finding their way back to the Scarlet Citadel. A character who stays in the portion of the pool that overlaps the Scarlet Citadel can return to this chamber automatically. A character who swims away into the sea can easily lose sight of the small spot where the sea and this mossy cavern overlap. A creature within 30 feet of the pool can spot it with a successful {@dc 10} Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check. From 31 to 60 feet away, the DC increases to 15; from 61 to 90 feet, the DC is 20; and so on. If a {@quickref Vision and Light||2||bright light} is shining into the pool from this chamber, the DC is reduced by 5.",

The sea bed is covered by stones, gravel, and sand, being too far down for most kelp and coral.",

A character who scans the sea bed from the floating pool and makes a successful {@dc 15} Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check spots something that looks different from the surrounding stones and with an unnaturally regular shape.",
														"The object is a bronze cylinder decorated to resemble a large, thick, squarish fish. It's 50 inches long, 18 inches in diameter, and weighs 220 pounds. Because this is heroic fantasy, we assume a character who's brave enough to swim down to the cylinder can lift it and even carry it while swimming, albeit clumsily. Creatures without a swimming speed move at half speed in water, and carrying this cylinder halves a creature's speed again. To retrieve the cylinder, a character with a speed 30 feet swimming as fast as possible (using {@action Dash} actions) needs about 45 seconds (7 turns) to swim down to the sea bed, a few seconds (1 turn) to retrieve the cylinder, and another 90 seconds (14 turns) to swim back up to the mossy cavern (assuming they can find it). That's between 2 and 3 minutes in the water. Strong characters can hold their breath for that long without difficulty, provided they don't run into complications such as being attacked by sharks or getting lost in the dark water. We recommend against adding {@skill Athletics} checks (for swimming) or Constitution saving throws (for holding your breath) to this attempt because they only turn it into a dice-rolling exercise. Sea predators and the threat of getting lost are enough danger, and they're more interesting.",
														"Characters might want to tie a rope around the cylinder and raise it that way instead of carrying it. This won't work unless the rope can be pulled straight up by someone suspended above the pool\u2014or is threaded through the bronze pulley attached to the ceiling. The pool is a dimensional wrinkle in space, not a hole in the floor. If the rope is pulled sideways, it simply falls out of the water onto the floor and the bottom 200 feet of it are sliced off by a sharp paradox. The pulley was the dwarves' answer to this problem, and it works like a charm.",

When the hook is lowered to the cylinder, it automatically catches in the fish's open mouth so the cylinder can be hauled up with a rope. The hook trick isn't apparent until characters see the bronze hook and someone gets a close look at the container.",

										"Both wrinkles do not, however, overlap the same region of sea. The pool in Area 320 intersects a warm tropical sea that's deep but not too deep for characters to swim in. This pool is an intersection with the depths of an icy northern sea, which makes it considerably more dangerous.",
										"The first danger is pressure. At the bottom of the pool in {@area Area 320|SC-320|x}, 500 feet below the surface of the sea, a character was under about 15 atmospheres of pressure. Here, a character who enters the pool is crushed by 200 atmospheres of pressure, caused by the depth of more than 6,500 feet. This immediately inflicts 27 ({@damage 6d8}) bludgeoning damage to a character sticking a head, chest, or entire body into the pool, or 9 ({@damage 2d8}) to an arm or leg. Fresh damage is caused every time the character starts its turn in the water.",
										"The second danger is cold. The water is barely above freezing. Compared to the risk from pressure, this danger is almost negligible. The character takes no cold damage just from poking a hand or other appendage into the water but takes 2 ({@damage 1d4}) cold damage every time it starts its turn more than half immersed in the water. Warm clothes don't help; they just get soaked with freezing water.",
										"The sea floor is 800 feet below this floating pool. There's no light at this depth, so it's impossible to see what's down there from the cavern (or even how far away the bottom is) and impossible to explore firsthand without a considerable amount of magical protection the characters almost certainly don't have. As in {@area Area 320|SC-320|x}, however, there is a bronze pulley affixed to the cavern ceiling above the pool and another fish-shaped bronze cylinder lying on the sea bed. If characters have the magical fishhook and 800 feet of rope, they can retrieve the cylinder. Its contents are described in the {@adventure Treasure|KPSC|6|Treasure|4} section.",
										"Before getting to that point, however, characters must deal with a surprise, because the cylinder doesn't come up alone. A {@creature giant octopus|MM} hitches a ride on it. If the characters pulling up this cylinder are the same ones who pulled up the other cylinders, they notice quickly that this object is heavier than the other one, but they have no way of knowing why until they get it to the cavern.",
										"When the cylinder reaches the floating pool, the octopus strikes. Characters can't see the creature clearly because it's obscured in the dark water; increase the octopus's AC by 5 to 16. Also, the octopus stays at the dead center of the pool (you should always feel free to treat the grid printed on the map as a measuring convenience, not a positioning restriction) and uses its 15-foot reach to its advantage. Characters whose melee weapons have only a 5-foot reach can't attack the octopus at all without sticking at least their arms into the crushing water. If a character is {@condition grappled} at the start of the octopus's turn, the octopus tries to pull that character into the water. Resolve this like a shoving contest, with opposed Strength ({@skill Athletics}) checks.",
										"The quickest and safest way for characters to kill the octopus is to lift the cylinder fully out of the pool into the cavern. The sudden, massive drop in pressure inflicts 27 ({@damage 6d8}) force damage to the octopus every time it's out of the water at the start of its turn. If it survives the first burst of this damage, it does its best to escape back into the pool as quickly as possible and return to the safety of the lightless, frigid deep.",

No matter where characters are searching and exploring in the tombs, clacker beetles can move quietly through other chambers and corridors to get past the intruders and surround them.",
								"The whole time characters are on this map, clacker beetles are stealthily maneuvering all around them. Unless characters post guards in positions where they can see every passage, the beetles find a way to get around them unseen. When the time is right, they attack en masse from every direction.",
								"\"When the time is right\" is up to you. If characters assault the nesting chamber ({@area Area 330|SC-330|x}) or cause alarm there, that certainly qualifies. If they unleash an alarming string of destructive magic (multiple rapid-fire {@spell thunderwave} spells in the warlocks' tomb, for example), that's another good trigger. Or if they're just being overly cautious and you're getting bored, that's an equally good excuse to liven things up. Ideally, however, the attack should come near the end of the party's explorations, after they've had a glimpse into the nesting chamber so they have an inkling of what they're losing out on by retreating.",
								"Remember, the number of soldier beetles and swarms is limitless. That doesn't give you carte blanche to overwhelm the characters with a single massive attack and kill everyone. You want to deliver a series of blows that knock the characters off balance and keep them that way until they withdraw from the level. Ideally that will be a fighting withdrawal with characters battling their way through weak points in the beetles' deployment to escape from traps and constantly seeking ways to get closer to the exit.",
								"Throw a wave of beetles at the party from several directions and, when those are nearly (but not entirely) all gone, launch the next wave. Appear to leave a path open for retreat, then when characters take it, slam it shut with another wave of beetles. Make it seem that the beetles are nearly wiped out and characters are on the verge of triumph, then bring in the biggest wave of reinforcements they've seen yet.",

When they're down to their last spells and their last hit points, and they're certain the next wave is bound to roll over them, that's the time for the beetles to commit a small but important mistake and leave a weak perimeter the characters can smash through to escape with their lives\u2014barely.",
								"In these fights, aim for a roughly even mix of soldier beetles and swarms. Vary the sizes of the waves. You can start big or small, but keep mixing it up. A small wave should have one enemy per character. A big one could have two, three, or even four enemies per character if they're arrayed in a way that lets the characters narrowly escape from a trap and bottle them up. Remember, the soldiers have a trait that allows them to double up in a 5-foot space, and a swarm can be in there too. Soldiers also like to position themselves behind swarms and attack by clacking. The more beetles overlap their clacking cones on targets, the better.",
								"Again, put the pressure on and keep it on, but keep it pulsing. Like any story, the battle should have dramatic highs and lows, furious action and brief lulls. The beetles are an implacable foe that simply doesn't ever give up."

								"First, some number of trollkin and lich hounds could have been away on a hunt or a raid when the characters arrived. Returning to find all their clansfolk killed is certain to set them on the path of vengeance. They are more than capable of resetting the level's traps and devising new ones in likely areas such as the tunnel to the surface ({@area Area 318|SC-318|x}) and the drop down to the bat caverns. Something as simple as weakening the fungus-rope ladder so it breaks while someone is climbing it gives that character a long fall and potentially traps the whole group in the deep levels.",
								"Second, one or two dire owlbears were left out of the level's forces because a few are always out hunting. Being barely intelligent, they're unlikely to seek revenge for murder; they kill for the sake of killing. They might also rip apart the fungus-rope ladder in the hole once the party uses it and gets their stink on it.",

It's up to you whether it recovers hit points between battles; we recommend giving it {@dice 12d10} Hit Dice and letting it heal via those, the same as a character.

Only one of those factions is committed to stopping the characters from descending deeper into the citadel and confronting {@creature Gellert the Gruesome|KPSC}. The characters alone aren't strong enough to defeat all three groups. They need to use diplomacy, intimidation, and subterfuge to play the factions against each other and defeat them one by one.",

This might sound cynical, but long experience shows that trying to shoehorn players into an intricate style of play they dislike and have no aptitude for is usually counterproductive. For them, we offer a more straightforward situation in which it's possible for characters to infiltrate the first group, slaughter everyone, smash into the second group, slaughter everyone, smash into the third group\u2014and maybe slaughter everyone, or maybe the party will be the ones getting slaughtered at that point. By the end, they'll certainly be covered in something\u2014whether it's glory or ignominy depends on whether the characters really are the badasses they believe themselves to be.",

The pacing in this battle is particularly important (see {@area 403. Bat Cavern|SC-403|x} for more information).",
										"Characters can take short rests after battles, but under this option they can't take long rests anywhere on this level.

The derro profess their loyalty to Imortra (not to Gellert, whom they've never seen), but their pledges mean nothing. They're barely sane at the best of times, and between the derro's fevered worship of Camazotz and the dangerous fungal extracts they imbibe, these times are less than ideal.",
										"Both groups of derro are vile and depraved. They have no sense of right or wrong. The strong do what they want and the weak cringe and cower to survive. No matter where an individual derro falls on that scale, they all enjoy tormenting and bullying anything weaker than themselves. Being bullied doesn't give them empathy for creatures in a similar plight; it only makes them want to punish something smaller even more. They don't fall in love, they don't care for the sick or the elderly or the wounded, and their own children survive on scraps and fear. If given the chance, they gleefully enslave the characters, blind them, torture them to death, and eat their flesh\u2014perhaps not in that order. The bats have a more stable society than the derro.",
										"To survive here, the characters must make deals with these monsters.",
										"Characters need to be cautious as they enter the bat caverns. The large and small caverns contain more than enough bats of every kind to overwhelm most parties, and that's before any derro get involved.",
										"Bear in mind, however, that a 6th-level wizard has the potential to cast three {@spell fireball|PHB|fireballs} in rapid succession. That's the perfect weapon in a wide-open arena like the central cavern ({@area Area 403|SC-403|x}), especially against flying enemies and swarms. If you set out hoping to shepherd characters through this level on the Delicate Balance path but make a mistake during the opening moves that results in most of the bats being rapidly slaughtered, you can try to recover the situation, or you can just go with it and switch to Into the Fray.",
										"A useful parallel here is a zombie apocalypse. Think of the bats like zombies. They're an obstacle, dangerous to someone who's cornered and out of options, but the real enemy is the living derro. The bats are just animals. The derro cultists are insane and homicidal.",
										"Unlike the Into the Fray option, the total enemy force here now is overwhelming even for 6th-level characters, and there's nowhere to hide and no safe way to retreat. Characters who try to smash their way through the level will kill plenty of bats and probably many derro, but in one long battle their luck runs out when Imortra and her conjured devils show up. Because the only way in or out (initially) is via an 80-foot rope ladder, characters who try to retreat will be picked off like birds on a wire.",
										"So what are characters to do? How can they \"defeat\" this level?",
										"The only reason the derro tolerate Imortra's presence is fear; they fear her and her conjured devils, and they're terrified of her unseen overlord {@creature Gellert the Gruesome|KPSC}. They don't care for each other either. The Camazotz cultists under {@creature Gilsfeyr|KPSC} think their non-worshiping cousins are heretics, and the fungus-growers under {@creature Kurgorom|KPSC} think the bat cultists are maniacs who'll be torn apart and eaten by their beloved bats eventually.",
										"Ideally, you want characters to get through this level by talking to its residents. The derro aren't here as guards. Unless characters are in the act of slaughtering all the bats, {@creature Gilsfeyr|KPSC} is intrigued by the appearance of powerful outsiders who could upset the local balance of power in his favor. {@creature Gilsfeyr|KPSC} and {@creature Kurgorom|KPSC} would both be happy to hear that the characters intend to kill Gellert. Either group will even offer to help them kill Imortra, provided they also wipe out the other band of derro.",
										"If someone is wearing {@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC}'s {@item purple amethyst brooch|KPSC|amethyst brooch}, the derro assume that character is in charge and address all their conversation toward the wearer. They figure out fairly quickly that the character is an imposter who stole the brooch from someone on an upper level, but it buys the wearer great deference in the meantime.",
										"The derro absolutely can't be trusted as allies; in fact, they're guaranteed to turn against the characters once their enemies have been killed. The chance for treasure and slaughter is irresistible to them, whereas the notion they should honor a promise to outsiders barely registers. Once they see what the characters are capable of, the derro might even throw a feast in the characters' honor and slip sleeping poison into their food or capture them in their sleep.",
										"In the end, the characters may wind up defeating everything on this level anyway. But if they approach the situation intelligently, they can play the three factions against each other and fight them one at a time instead of all at once and thereby have a chance to survive.",
										"{@i You can't railroad characters into this line of action.} Give them clues and opportunities, but the players decide what their characters do. If they form a plan that's guaranteed to fail and get them killed or captured (or they blunder ahead with no plan at all), you should point out the immense risk, but you can't forbid them from choosing their own path.",
										"Always be flexible. Characters might come up with an excellent plan that's completely different from the \"divide and conquer\" approach suggested above. If you think it could work, let it play out. Player creativity deserves to be rewarded.",
										"But don't let a weak or foolish plan succeed out of sympathy. At the very least, characters who blunder in this situation should be captured, tormented, and humiliated for a while before pulling off a daring escape."

												"The Black River is an enigma. First but also least, it is an actual, flowing subterranean river, although its course has never been mapped. Paradoxically, its direction of flow has been known to sometimes reverse itself for unknown reasons. It's also a shadow river: a watery version of the fey roads that crisscross the Shadow Realm between Midgard and the Bright Land of the elves. Finally, its course coincides with several ley lines for part of its length. What effect this overlap has and how it impacts the physical and shadow aspects of the river is not well understood. That mystery is precisely what drew so many entities to this neighborhood and why {@creature Gellert the Gruesome|KPSC} is studying the river now.",
												"In addition to these mysteries, the dwarves who built much of the citadel brought with them from Melana the faith of Charun {@creature the Boatman|KPSC}. The Black River flowing beneath the citadel was a metaphor for Charun's sacred black river of tears, which was said to connect the mortal world to Yggdrasil, and Midgard to the many realms of the outer planes. Charun's influence is strong on the river, raising the possibility the actual Black River and the symbolic black river of tears might have more in common than a coincidence of name.",
												"Whether or not the dwarves realized it, the Black River flowing under the citadel is more than a metaphor. Cultists of Charun make pilgrimages along shadow rivers. It was one such pilgrimage that brought the shadow elf wizard Quendreth the Wise and a company of pilgrims to this spot. Quendreth recognized the geomantic power of the site and built a temple here. The mystic convergence of shadow road and ley lines infused the temple with arcane power, and the temple fed that power back into shadow road and ley line.",
												"Charun's cult has many dark aspects but it's not inherently evil. Its preoccupation with death doesn't involve spreading death, or promoting death as a goal, or death as an expression of chaos. Rather, it recognizes that all mortal beings eventually die and it heralds Charun's role as the soul's guide into the afterlife. Still, any \"cult of death\" attracts unsavory followers who, if they gain influence, turn it toward ever more evil beliefs and pursuits. This is what happened to the temple of Charun beneath the citadel.",

Before long, members of the cult became more enthralled with undeath than with life. Eventually {@creature Llagfel|KPSC} pursued rituals that, with Vardesain's help (in the form of the horrific chained thing), transformed her into a {@creature hierophant lich|CCodex} and her most faithful followers into phantom wights.",
														"At that point, the only creature along the Black River with the power to challenge {@creature Llagfel|KPSC} was a shadow river lord with whom the Charun cultists had maintained a nervous truce. {@creature Llagfel|KPSC} arranged an ambush, and the shadow river lord was captured and imprisoned in a specially built and sealed sarcophagus ({@area Area 511|SC-511|x}). {@creature Llagfel|KPSC} converted the main temple of Charun to worship of Vardesain and into a crypt for herself and her faithful myrmidons ({@area Area 509|SC-509|x}).",

It is the remnant of a once-important site, perverted to evil purposes and occupied by undead creatures and horrid aberrations that no longer remember why they're here.

Since characters probably can't defeat the lich without the river lord's help, they need to find a way to release it. Complicating this is the fact that {@creature Llagfel|KPSC} holds the key to the river lord's sarcophagus, so characters must face the lich at least once on their own before they can set the wheels of ancient vengeance into motion."

Inside the hollow is a mummified quipper with gold and silver accents sewn along its fins and gills and with aquamarine stones in its eye sockets. The easiest way to destroy it here is to toss it into the {@item sphere of annihilation} on Level 6. Gellert will take it off the characters' hands if they ask, but he won't say what he has in mind for it. That's a temporary solution at best, since the characters are likely to fight Gellert to the death eventually. The library automatons might be persuaded to take the phylactery and abandon it sometime in the far future. The fate eaters express great interest in it if characters still have it during that conversation; they gladly take it, but like Gellert, don't explain their intentions for it. Tossing the phylactery through the portal in {@area Area 505|SC-505|x} into the plateau of Leng is guaranteed to have unfortunate consequences. {@creature Llagfel|KPSC}'s body can't reform while the phylactery is in the illumination from the {@item ghoul light|KPSC}, for as long as characters can keep it lit.

Whether the current reverses direction while characters are on the river is up to you and your estimation of whether another complication is needed. This event should serve more as a spooky, atmospheric element than as a real obstacle. The current of the Black River is generally sluggish anyway."

She can bedevil the characters as they're coming and going on the river, and she can even follow them surreptitiously as they return to the main maps to attack them while they rest; it's fairly simple for Solnis to snatch someone with her hair and drag them into the river, especially if they're dozing within 15 feet of the water."

When characters return to {@area Area 518|SC-518|x}, they find Solnis waiting for them, soaking wet, shivering, and collapsed on the damp stone floor. Her story about having escaped from the deep ones and needing help might be more believable under these circumstances.",
														"A second alternative, again depending on your knowledge of your players, is that the deep ones finally captured Solnis only a few hours or days before the characters arrived. Eventually she'll be tossed to the {@creature shoggoth|ToB} in the dark pool, but when characters arrive, she's being tormented by vengeful deep ones in the shrine ({@area Area 520|SC-520|x}). This adds credibility to her story and makes it all the more shocking when, as characters are escorting her back across the bridge, she grapples someone with her hair and dives into the river.",
														"If you use the first of these scenarios, Renry knows nothing about Solnis and has never seen her before. In the second of these scenarios, Renry probably heard Solnis being tormented in the shrine but knows nothing about where she came from or how long she's been a captive."

Have a private conversation with that character before the game and offer to let them replace their current character with one they'd enjoy more in exchange for killing their character in a spectacular way.

						"A bezoar is a consumable magic item, similar to a potion, and you must swallow it whole to gain its effects. When you swallow it, you take {@damage 1d6 + 1} acid damage, and your hit point maximum is reduced by an equal amount for the bezoar's duration. The bezoar remains active in your belly for a number of days equal to the damage taken. After that time, you automatically regurgitate the used-up bezoar, for which you take another {@damage 1d6 + 1} acid damage, but your hit point maximum returns to normal. A used-up bezoar has no power and soon crumbles away.",
						"A bezoar can be removed prior to its full duration with a {@dc 15} Wisdom ({@skill Medicine}) check but still deals the secondary damage as you regurgitate it. A partially used bezoar recharges itself after being out of a body for 24 hours. Swallowing it again after that allows a new roll for duration. You can only have one bezoar active at a time, and while one is active, you do not gain any benefit from other consumable magic items, such as potions. While uncomfortable, this doesn't impact your ability to eat and drink though.",
						"Owlbears are not picky eaters and wind up devouring all sorts of nastiness: carrion, furry creatures, fey river stones, feathery things, nut shells, fish bones, and shadow-fused bone. As such, any bezoar has a {@chance 50|50% chance|Bezoar|The bezoar is not cursed.|The bezoar is cursed.} of being cursed. You can't remove a cursed bezoar before its full duration (when you will regurgitate it as normal) unless you are first targeted by a {@spell remove curse} spell. However, if the bezoar is not removed before your next short or long rest after the spell's casting, the curse returns. The curse ends automatically once the bezoar is regurgitated.",

											"type": "list",

												"The most essential ingredient of scarlet mead is brazen saffron, or the stigma and styles (or threads) of the ashy crocus. Just before the flowers bloom, the petals will loosen, and before sunrise on that day, the threads must be collected. It is vital that this be performed in the dark, avoiding any exposure to the sun or to exceptional heat as the threads will self-ignite, a normal part of its life cycle. {@i (The ashen crocus originates from beyond the World Tree and does not grow well at all on Midgard, requiring the heat of the deepest desert to ensure its vitality. It is possible to maintain smalt batches in less blistering climes, but the upkeep is great. Though not easy to find, it is still often easier to purchase the spice, but you must stay vigüant of the provenance. Samples of sufficient quality wit! typically come as a Singte thread sealed within an opaque glass ampule or within a specially hardened wax. You must put great trust in your purveyor!)}",
												"Add equal parts pure water, preferably glacial melt, and honey. The best honey is from the early spring, where crocuses are plentiful\u2014any crocus variety will do for this\u2014while other honey tends to produce successfully only half the time. Bring the mixture to a boil in an area devoid of natural light. Add an unbroken ampule of brazen saffron: the heat will eventually shatter the glass (or melt the wax), allowing the saffron to mix. The decoction will need to simmer for at least a week; add additional water as needed to maintain volume. You will know it is done when it looks like liquid fire, taking on the appearance of the saffron itself.",
												"Once ready, add to a charred cask for fermentation\u2014ensuring the saffron thread remains with the batch. Just before sealing, you must add scrapings from the \"flesh\" of some elemental creature of the flame, such as from a salamander or from certain mephits. (The dormant spores carried on the creature from their home beyond the World Tree thrive on heat.) The casks should be kept underground in areas of \"uncomfortable heat\" for at least a year, though timings may vary depending on the average ambient temperatures, when it is ready for imbibing."
