Through narration blocks, variants, and actual {@i narrative}, the {@i Companion} should make running WDMM easier for you and more satisfying for your players.

As the months went by, it became clear that I had bitten off more than I could chew. Inevitably, the {@i Companion} felt like an anchor around my neck; I wanted to work on other projects (and did, which only contributed to dragging this out). I consistently felt like I was letting people down, that I was failing to live up to my side of the bargain. Every few weeks, or even a few days, I would get a message from someone asking if I \"intended to finish\" the {@i Companion}, or when the next chapter would be released. I distinctly remember someone commenting on {@i WDMM IX}, \"It was an ambitious project...\" when I still had yet to deliver the next chapter. You can actually still read that comment on the DMs Guild sales page right now. Well, who's laughing now, Francisco? Who's laughin' now?",
										"These emotions hounded me day and night. I would come up with a new idea, or work on a short story, and think, \"You still need to finish the {@i Companion}.\" I could never escape these reminders. Not while I was relaxing, not while I was working out, not even between beers at the bar. Try as I might, I couldn't shake this shadow. I felt like a disappointment\u2014yet every time I posted another chapter, I would be {@i flooded} with support, praise, and even gratitude. I cannot even begin to explain how {@i vital} this was; and because of this unfettered support\u2014{@i your} support\u2014I was able to finish this behemoth of a project. Your patience and kindness cannot be described by mere words, and I will be eternally grateful for every person that supported me on this long and fulfilling journey."

Nay, the fans demand blood, they demand entertainment, and so Halaster expects the party to best Netherskull, who was previously an optional boss. To facilitate this, a sealed, magical door separates Levels 15 and 16, which can only be opened by the bone keys that were previously found in Areas 19 and 30B. Now the keys are carried by Netherskull or left in Area 39C. With this change, the doors to Netherskull's lair must be open when the party has experienced enough of the Obstacle Course. This discretion is left to you and facilitated by Halaster. If the party reaches Area 39C too early, you can have the doors locked, if you so wish."
