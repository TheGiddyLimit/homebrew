								"Memoria is a forgotten ruin mostly vanished into the lowland bogs north of Redtower. Its obscurity is ironic: Once, it was a settlement dedicated to Mnemosyne, goddess of memory, who has, likewise, suffered an unhappy fate. Centuries ago, a mysterious cult of benign necromancers founded Memoria after fleeing elven authority and condemnation in Kammae, settling in the White Forest to take advantage of the area's potent ley lines. These necromancers did not defile the dead. They utilized necromancy to interact with their ancestors, hoping to create a utopia of peaceful co-existence for the living and dead with the past and present side-by-side.",
								"To achieve this vision, the Memorians devised a relic called the {@item light of Memoria|WL50} to create a bridge to the afterlife and light the way for their ancestors' spirits to cross into the mortal world. Avoiding bloodshed, the Memorians empowered the relic with communal sacrifice of many years of their lives. When at last they enacted the ritual, however, something went wrong. Instead of their ancestors' spirits peacefully transitioning, they brought forward an army of twisted specters, wraiths, and shadows which overwhelmed Memoria.",
								"The surviving Memorians retreated to a nearby shadow gate, but the undead followed. To prevent their mistakes from endangering others, the Memorians used the {@item light of Memoria|WL50|light} to sever the gate's connection to the shadow roads and sealed the undead\u2014and themselves\u2014in a pocket dimension called the Oubliette. Memoria and the cult of Mnemosyne who built it fell out of reckoning. The dormant gate became an eerie local curiosity, and the {@item light of Memoria|WL50|light} disappeared, buried beneath the elements."

Dameka and her companions reside in the White Forest, preying on adventurers drawn to the Scarlet Citadel and occasionally performing odd jobs for {@creature Gellert the Gruesome|KPSC}. She has never met {@creature Gellert the Gruesome|KPSC|Gellert} and works primarily through his intermediaries. One such intermediary, {@creature Cagoth-ze|KPSC} (see the Hapless Apprentice sidebar on page 5), sent her in search of {@creature Tymon|WL50} after the young apprentice didn't return from his task.",

Eventually, she pockets the {@item light of Memoria|WL50|light} and the {@creature bandit|MM|bandits} spread out, likely flushing out the PCs. If found or if the PCs interrupt them, Dameka is relieved for an end to the boredom. She leads the attack, gleeful for the potential of better loot than Tymon's leftovers. If Dameka is killed, the other {@creature bandit|MM|bandits} flee into the forest and leave the {@item light of Memoria|WL50|light} behind."

A terrible shrieking erupts all around you as the archway warps and goes dark, echoing the notes of triumphant grief in your mind before you feel cold, incorporeal talons tear into you."
