Centuries ago, a mysterious cult of benign necromancers founded Memoria after fleeing elven authority and condemnation in Kammae, settling in the White Forest to take advantage of the area's potent ley lines. These necromancers did not defile the dead. They utilized necromancy to interact with their ancestors, hoping to create a utopia of peaceful co-existence for the living and dead with the past and present side-by-side.",

Avoiding bloodshed, the Memorians empowered the relic with communal sacrifice of many years of their lives. When at last they enacted the ritual, however, something went wrong. Instead of their ancestors' spirits peacefully transitioning, they brought forward an army of twisted specters, wraiths, and shadows which overwhelmed Memoria.",

To prevent their mistakes from endangering others, the Memorians used the {@item light of Memoria|WL50|light} to sever the gate's connection to the shadow roads and sealed the undead\u2014and themselves\u2014in a pocket dimension called the Oubliette. Memoria and the cult of Mnemosyne who built it fell out of reckoning.
