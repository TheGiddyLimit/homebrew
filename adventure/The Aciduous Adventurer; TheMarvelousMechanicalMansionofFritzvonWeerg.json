										"Her fascination with his talents led her to commission Fritz to craft a unique gift for her niece. He happily obliged. She also requested they have dinner to discuss her ideas for the present. He obliged again. Dinner became a standing, weekly event. When he finally finished the present, they parted ways. Several months passed before she returned with a new request. She wondered, if after spending years crafting small trinkets, the mad maker had ever thought to try something larger. A life-sized puppet, perhaps.",

The two eventually fell in love, despite her family's protests that it was her duty to woo and wed Lord Strahd von Zarovich. Dorfniya respected her family's wishes, but she was also terribly aware that the new Lord of Barovia had no interest in her.",
										"The day of Dorfniya's next journey to the land of Barovia neared, and a fear grew in Fritz. Pidlwick II was not ready. Instilling the jester's range of emotion and intelligence into a toy required research beyond a tinkerer's knowledge and despite Fritz's attempts, he found no solution in texts on the anatomical nor the arcane.
