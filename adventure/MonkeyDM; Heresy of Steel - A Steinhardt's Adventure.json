The Radiant Church has been desperate to cleanse what they consider a den of evil from the city and is willing to go to extreme lengths to see the market destroyed.

Unfortunately, the mission went awry, leading to heavy losses among Thistlemane's men. Though they managed to trap the {@creature Devouring Belua|SGttEH|belua} in the sewers, they lost track of it.

The once plush seats bear the imprints of countless travelers, the upholstery threadbare in places but still offering some semblance of comfort. Though the air inside the train is thick with the smell of coal and old leather, the windows remain tightly sealed, their glass fogged and smeared from years of travel.

My mission is to delve into these ancient ruins, piecing together their history and secrets. This journey will force me to question the truths I've long held and confront the reality that the knowledge I uncover could either save Luyarnha or hasten its downfall. Can the wisdom of a civilization long gone light our way forward, or will it only reveal our inevitable demise?"
