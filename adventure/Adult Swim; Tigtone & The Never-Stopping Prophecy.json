And now I pass that complicated knowledge on to you! Although Tigtone is a master of sword and slashery, I think his greatest asset is his questaddled mind and his uniquely Tigtone-ian approach to questing\u2014something I may be able to help you emulate with what I'm calling...",

If there are no stakes then he makes darn sure that it at least feels like there are! In other words, no matter what the task (whether it's defeating a cave demon or pouring a bowl of soup) if you treat it as if the stakes are high, then everything you do will be exciting! In more other words: Fake it 'till you stake it! This goes for the game master when writing quests, or the party members as they go through the quest!",

Will the person starve to death and comeback as a hungry ghost to torment your stomach? What amazing things will happen if you succeed? Will the soup be so hot it melts their face and they become a villain whose name is Soup-or-trooper? That's pretty amazing because now you have someone to fight with!",
