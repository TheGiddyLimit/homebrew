												"A few months ago, Tharian and his daughter Anaya arrived in Minarrh as missionary healers and joined the local temple. When they moved into their quarters on the temple grounds, Tharian began to hear whispers in his mind as he walked the hallways. The mysterious voice told him of a secret door in the temple, which led to a hidden crypt. There he found an obsidian urn, inlaid with red and gold and marked with strange runes. The voice spoke to Tharian, telling him that it would guide him to cleanse the town of evil and protect the true believers through faithful prayer.",
												"When he laid hands on the urn, the voice grew in power and began to sway him to do more and more acts of \"devotion,\" including bringing the urn from the crypt to a space below the dais in the main sanctum, reciting Abyssal incantations by night, and encouraging the villages to further their devotion by spending more time in the temple.",
												"Through the demon's influence, Tharian convinced most of the local council of elders to meet with him in the temple, bringing them close enough to Xarashtar's urn for the demon to place them under his control through magic similar to a {@spell Mass Suggestion|XPHB} spell. The council gave Tharian full control over the temple's rites and rituals\u2014replacing the role of the elder who refused to attend the meeting\u2014and thus allowing Tharian to further sway the villagers with his fervent sermons and frequent demonstrations of faith."

When he noticed her presence, Tharian, under Xarashtar's control, imprisoned Anaya in her room, as the demon knew that if he could keep her there for more than 24 hours, she would be afflicted by the malady and perish before revealing the truth.",

Mannan immediately went to the local thieves' guild and promised them a large sum if they would help him free her and secure their passage to his home in the forest, where he lives with his aunt Lysxia, an archdruid who pledged her fealty to a goddess of the forest and is bound to her grove there. The thieves' guild spirited the young lovers away, where Lysxia cured Anaya and hid them within her grove, protected by powerful nature magic."
