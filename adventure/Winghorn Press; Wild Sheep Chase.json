								"There is a sound of clattering hooves, surprised yelps and a frantic bleating, Before the party can react, a sheep bounds towards them. The beast appears to be a regular sheep in every way - fluffy white coat, black face, curled horns - but it is carrying and elaborate scroll in its mouth.",

								"A wax seal purports that it is a {@item spell scroll|dmg|scroll of} {@spell speak with animals|phb|speak with animals (modified)}. If a character says this out loud - to explain to other party members, for example - the sheep appears to nod and bleat enthusiastically.",
								"Should they use the scroll (simply reading it aloud is enough to activate the spell within), all of them hear the sheep's baaing instantly morphs into cultured, elven-accented Common, albeit with a slight hint of a bleat.",
								"After establishing that the player can understand what it's saying, the sheep introduces itself as {@b Finethir Shinebright}, a wizard in dire need of aid. If the players are willing to listen, he explains that he recognises them as adventurers and that he is in dire need of their aid.",

								"While he prefers violence and intimidation, he is also willing to offer bribes and promises of magical favours if that looks like the best option.",

										"Despite his flaws, however, he is generally good-hearted. Assuming he notices them and it doesn't inconvenience him too much he will try to help others where possible, though he will loudly complain of their inability to grasp concepts as simple as poly-planal transweave theory.",

A master of transmutation, he would regularly be called upon to carry out grand tasks such as clearing blocked roads by turning massive boulders into rabbits.Two years as a sheep have taught him very little about humility, but a lot about grass. If he returns to his natural form, Shinebright is a willow-thin high elf with straw-coloured hair and an extremely long nose."

If they're feeling mercenary, he reminds the party that in his true form he is a powerful and wealthy wizard and promises great rewards.

										"One fateful night he ended from his meditative trance to find his apprentice, Ahmed Noke, standing over him, clutching the wand. Shinebright demanded to know what the boy was doing, but the only noise he could produce was an angry 'baaaaah'.",
										"The wizard became a virtual prisoner in his own garden. He was forced to graze on nothing but grass and buttercups while hungry wolves and other beasts - actually polymorphed guards - looked on.",
										"Last night he felt hope for the first time in many months when Noke left his home without closing the door. Shinebright snuck in, made his way to an old bookshelf and stole the Scroll of Speak to Animals. He then rushed into town with the scroll clenched between his teeth, and was searching desperately for the aura of magic that would indicate someone able to activate the spell when he found the party.",
										"In order to turn back into his original form he needs another dose of {@spell true polymorph}. Which means he needs access to his old wand.",

It is about 20ft above the ground and is fully enclosed with a wall formed from twisting branches. You can see evenly spaced, window-sized gaps, as well as what appears to be a door at the point closest to the garden platform.",

										"Noke once hero-worshipped Shinebright and served as his apprentice for many years. However, as time dragged on and on there was never any change in their relationship.",
										"Decades passed and still the master transmuter treated him like a child, expected to cook, clean and recite answers by rote. When Noke pressed him on it, Shinebright would explain that his was how he had been taught, and didn't seem to register Noke's claims that, as a human, he couldn't spare a century to serve out an apprenticeship.",
										"At the same time, Noke began to realise that much of Shinebright's acclaim came not from his own abilities - extensive as they were - but from the Wand of True Polymorph he wielded.",
										"Eventually he cracked, and turned on his former master before setting himself up as a master wizard. However, a combination of guilt and suddenly unstoppered ambition spelled bad news for his mental state.",
										"He is paranoid that someone will attack him as he attacked Shinebright and rarely sleeps. This paranoia has led him to invest in a troop of guards, many of whom he has transmuted into stronger, more bestial forms."

								"When the party arrives at the compound, there is a trio of {@creature ape|mm|apes} either sleeping or playing with an oversized pair of dice on the lawn, with iron greatswords stuck into the ground next to them. A {@creature brown bear|mm} is in the outhouse, taking care of business.",
								"The door to the central platform is almost always locked, requiring a DC14 Strength ({@skill Athletics}) to break down or a DC12 {@item thieves' tools|phb} check to pick. Inside, the area is divided up in to three sections. One contains a combination library and lab, one a sitting room and one dining room/kitchen. Untidy bookshelves line much of the outer walls, and worktables are covered with stacks of ink-spattered notes and complicated anatomical diagrams of various beasts and monsters.",
								"The tallest platform functions as a bedroom for {@creature Ahmed Noke|wsc|Noke}, containing little beyond a wardrobe, a large wooden bed and a cluttered dressing table.",
								"The huts contain one or two beds each, a few of which are oversized, as well as the general detritus of the common men who occupy them.",
								"Noke is in the central platform, working furiously on new spells. If he notices the party as they approach he will order them to \"Return the sheep - in return I will not destroy you all.\" If they talk, he will reveal his reasons for hating Shinebright and boast disjointedly of his own achievements. He will also ask if they killed 'my man, Guz' and be visibly upset if they have. Should they refuse to return Shinebright he will order his men to attack.",
								"The most important part of any fight that breaks out is Noke, who is offensively weak but can buff his allies dramatically. Once the brown bear emerges from the outhouse he will cast {@spell enlarge/reduce} on it to increase its damage. He will supplement his minions' attacks with {@spell ray of frost} but will focus on keeping up concentration.",
								"The apes will act intelligently, and as they are wielding greatswords, their Fist attack is replaced by a Slash that deals 10 ({@damage 2d6+3}) slashing damage. They aren't likely to fight to the death and will flee once they fall below half health.",
								"Once it is clear that the fight is lost, or a player simply gets too close to him, Noke will cast {@spell expeditious retreat} and flee into the central platform, locking the door behind him. He will move to his bedroom as fast as he can, and casts {@spell true polymorph} on the largest thing he can find - his bed.",
								"Three rounds after he runs away he bursts from the roof of his bedroom riding the {@creature bed dragon wyrmling|wsc}, a beast that looks like a dragon carved from wood, with billowing bedsheets for wings and a tail that ends in a soft pillow. If the party are in the main living area he will crash through the ceiling and attack.",
								"The Wyrmling is not that smart and will use its Splinter Breath as often as possible, simply trying to attack the closest target when it is not available. It will, however, prioritise enemies that use fire against it. While riding the wyrmling, Noke will simply use ray of frost to slow down any party members trying to retreat.",
								"Should the Wyrmling be lost\u2013either to damage or because Noke loses concentration\u2013it will turn back into a thoroughly beaten-up old bed. Desperate and unwilling to let his old master win, a babbling Noke will then attempt to use the wand on himself, intending to transmute his form into that of some monstrous creature.",
								"However, the over-used wand will crackle, fizz and malfunction with a loud bang, turning Noke into a {@creature gibbering mouther} - a misshapen pile of flesh that bellows incoherently from dozens of mouths. The sad creature will attack mindlessly until completely destroyed.",

										"Noke is naturally paranoid and Shinebright's recent escape hasn't exactly improved his outlook. This makes luring him away from the safety of his tower an extremely difficult task, though not an impossible one.",
										"Noke's lust for fame and power slightly outweighs his fear of being unseated, for the time being at least. This means that a very, very skilled set of liars with a sufficiently devious plan and a good helping of luck may be able to tempt him with the offer of a particularly prestigious, lucrative contract.",
										"Even so, when Noke leaves he will take all of his remaining bodyguards with him and will be extremely quick to suspect the party of betrayal if there is any hint of a double-cross. He will, of course, have his wand to hand at all times. Should he be given enough time to cast it, Noke will use a charge of true polymorph to transmute some nearby item into a wyrmling that uses roughly the same stats as the {@creature bed dragon wyrmling|wsc}.",

At the sight of his former apprentice's ruined corpse, Shinebright may even undergo some realisation of how poorly he treated his former apprentice and turn somber despite his triumph.",
								"Even if he is made aware of the dangers associated with his old wand, Shinebright will still be willing to risk his life in order to be turned back into an elf. However, he is also open to persuasion if the party try to talk him out of it. A compelling argument and a DC 15 Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) will be enough to make the former wizard reconsider his options.",

The party is free to honour his final wish and leave the tower more-or-less intact, or loot to their hearts' content.

If the players wish they can also take the entire tower complex as their own, though this may cause trouble when the local nobles try to pay Noke a visit and find him missing...",
