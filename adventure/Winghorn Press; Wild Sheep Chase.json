If they fail by more than five, in addition to the above consequences the wand explodes violently, dealing {@dice 1d12} force damage to all creatures within 10 ft for each charge remaining in the wand.

Shinebright snuck in, made his way to an old bookshelf and stole the Scroll of Speak to Animals. He then rushed into town with the scroll clenched between his teeth, and was searching desperately for the aura of magic that would indicate someone able to activate the spell when he found the party.",

When Noke pressed him on it, Shinebright would explain that his was how he had been taught, and didn't seem to register Noke's claims that, as a human, he couldn't spare a century to serve out an apprenticeship.",
										"At the same time, Noke began to realise that much of Shinebright's acclaim came not from his own abilities - extensive as they were - but from the Wand of True Polymorph he wielded.",
										"Eventually he cracked, and turned on his former master before setting himself up as a master wizard. However, a combination of guilt and suddenly unstoppered ambition spelled bad news for his mental state.",

								"The door to the central platform is almost always locked, requiring a DC14 Strength ({@skill Athletics}) to break down or a DC12 {@item thieves' tools|phb} check to pick. Inside, the area is divided up in to three sections. One contains a combination library and lab, one a sitting room and one dining room/kitchen. Untidy bookshelves line much of the outer walls, and worktables are covered with stacks of ink-spattered notes and complicated anatomical diagrams of various beasts and monsters.",

If he notices the party as they approach he will order them to \"Return the sheep - in return I will not destroy you all.\" If they talk, he will reveal his reasons for hating Shinebright and boast disjointedly of his own achievements. He will also ask if they killed 'my man, Guz' and be visibly upset if they have. Should they refuse to return Shinebright he will order his men to attack.",
								"The most important part of any fight that breaks out is Noke, who is offensively weak but can buff his allies dramatically. Once the brown bear emerges from the outhouse he will cast {@spell enlarge/reduce} on it to increase its damage. He will supplement his minions' attacks with {@spell ray of frost} but will focus on keeping up concentration.",
								"The apes will act intelligently, and as they are wielding greatswords, their Fist attack is replaced by a Slash that deals 10 ({@damage 2d6+3}) slashing damage. They aren't likely to fight to the death and will flee once they fall below half health.",
								"Once it is clear that the fight is lost, or a player simply gets too close to him, Noke will cast {@spell expeditious retreat} and flee into the central platform, locking the door behind him. He will move to his bedroom as fast as he can, and casts {@spell true polymorph} on the largest thing he can find - his bed.",
								"Three rounds after he runs away he bursts from the roof of his bedroom riding the {@creature bed dragon wyrmling|wsc}, a beast that looks like a dragon carved from wood, with billowing bedsheets for wings and a tail that ends in a soft pillow. If the party are in the main living area he will crash through the ceiling and attack.",
								"The Wyrmling is not that smart and will use its Splinter Breath as often as possible, simply trying to attack the closest target when it is not available. It will, however, prioritise enemies that use fire against it. While riding the wyrmling, Noke will simply use ray of frost to slow down any party members trying to retreat.",
								"Should the Wyrmling be lost\u2013either to damage or because Noke loses concentration\u2013it will turn back into a thoroughly beaten-up old bed. Desperate and unwilling to let his old master win, a babbling Noke will then attempt to use the wand on himself, intending to transmute his form into that of some monstrous creature.",
								"However, the over-used wand will crackle, fizz and malfunction with a loud bang, turning Noke into a {@creature gibbering mouther} - a misshapen pile of flesh that bellows incoherently from dozens of mouths. The sad creature will attack mindlessly until completely destroyed.",

This means that a very, very skilled set of liars with a sufficiently devious plan and a good helping of luck may be able to tempt him with the offer of a particularly prestigious, lucrative contract.",
										"Even so, when Noke leaves he will take all of his remaining bodyguards with him and will be extremely quick to suspect the party of betrayal if there is any hint of a double-cross. He will, of course, have his wand to hand at all times. Should he be given enough time to cast it, Noke will use a charge of true polymorph to transmute some nearby item into a wyrmling that uses roughly the same stats as the {@creature bed dragon wyrmling|wsc}.",

However, he is also open to persuasion if the party try to talk him out of it.

								"{@b If the party decides to go ahead with the spell and it succeeds}, Shinebright congratulates the party heartily. He will have to be reminded of anything he actually promised them while he was still a sheep, and cannot actually pay any financial reward, as Noke was virtually bankrupt and had sold most items to pay for research materials and guards.",
								"He will, however, be willing to perform transmutations of up to 5th level for them, charging just enough to cover thecomponents. He will also take in any polymorphed guards who fled, promising to work towards returning them to their natural shapes.",
								"{@b If the party decides to go ahead with the spell and it fails}, Shinebright dies permanently. The party is free to honour his final wish and leave the tower more-or-less intact, or loot to their hearts' content. The tower is surprisingly empty of anything of benefit to non-transmuters, however, with valuables restricted to expensive lab equipment and arcane paraphernalia estimated to be worth around 1,000gp. If the players wish they can also take the entire tower complex as their own, though this may cause trouble when the local nobles try to pay Noke a visit and find him missing...",
								"{@b If the party refuse to perform the spell}, Shinebright accepts but will not give up his hopes entirely. He will take back his old home and work towards a way to remove his curse. In any case, he heads to the bedroom and slips on one of his old robes, which he wears until he is transformed back to his natural shape. Though he will be upset with them, Shinebright will acknowledge that he owes the party a large debt.",
								"In any case, any adventurers that help Shinebright to deal with Noke each recieve 500xp.",

										"A stealthy party may be able to steal the wand while Noke sleeps or a combination of lucky roles and inventive tactics may allow a player to disarm the wizard.",
										"Should this happen, don't force the story back towards the 'ideal path', but allow it to develop naturally.",
										"One thing that you must do, however, is try to provide at least a hint of the dangers associated with the modified wand before the players try and use it. Possibly it sparks unnaturally when a character touches it, or Noke himself may feel honourbound to warn them."
