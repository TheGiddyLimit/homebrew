						"The creature is cloaked in dark rags that hang off their hunched form, two massive lanterns dangling from fleshy protrusions off their back. Their arms and legs are gangly and long, as though they walk on stilts as they lumber forward on all fours. Their face is expressionless and pale, with hollow black pools for eyes. As their mouth opens, their jaw unhinges to reveal a gaping maw filled with spiked, hooked teeth. The creature's screech is harrowing as lamps glow brighter and motes of arcane energy flit about them.",
						"Before the cataclysm that claimed Drakkenheim, lamplighters would traverse the city's streets at dusk, ensuring all the lanterns along the main thoroughfares were lit. Once, those lanterns were guiding lights to those making their way home at the end of the day. Now, the contamination that spreads through Drakkenheim has transformed the former lamplighters into twisted abominations. Their forms have merged with the lanterns they once kept lit, letting them lure creatures in the ruins toward their comforting lights\u2014then devour those creatures while they bask in the glow.",
						"In their contaminated madness, lamplighters view other creatures as pests desiring to put out their lanterns, and so they have resolved to snuff out those creatures instead.

These creatures are territorial to the streets they worked in life, and they will return to that territory once healed, continuing to protect their precious lights against intruders.",

The ancient imperial walls of Drakkenheim still stand, separating the Inner City and Outer City. However, those walls and their gates are home to numerous hostile gargoyles which descend from their perches to attack anyone who dares to trespass within the city. This makes excursions intended to plunder the treasures of Drakkenheim both difficult and dangerous.",

Though such routes might offer safer ways to get inside Drakkenheim, no one is so far known to have found one. However, a recently discovered old smuggler's map shows three secret passages that connect the sewer systems of the Outer and Inner Cities. Unfortunately, it's anyone's guess as to whether the map is genuine, let alone whether some collapse, monster's rampage, or other calamity has blocked the hidden tunnels since the map was made. Whether acting on their own or at the behest of others, it falls to the characters to enter the sewers to verify the veracity of the map and determine which of its routes are traversable\u2014even as they take on the deadly challenges beneath the city.",
