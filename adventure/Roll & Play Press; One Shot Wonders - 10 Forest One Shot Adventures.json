Powerful mages conjure incredible constructs and terrifying entities. Beings from other realms stray into the world, bringing miracles and mischief with them. Around every bend is a new wonder to behold.",

Ties to spirits and the divine typically have a strong hold in this region, particularly Himaya, the jovial god of hearth-and-home and his impassive partner, Ramad, the god of death.",
								"Heading south, those living in the shadow of the smouldering Mkali Peaks are naturally vigilant and often live in fortified settlements, built during previous periods of conflict. In contrast, the dangers of travel in the Wychwood Marshes are sometimes less obvious. There are limited main roads through this rugged landscape, so residents rely on their knowledge of the environment to guide them.",
								"Mirabilis's central region is the Mellow Valley, where fertile soil nurtures areas of dense woodland and thriving agricultural communities. While the Valley offers safety and security, more adventurous souls are often drawn to coastal towns, unable to resist the siren's call of exploration and new experiences offered by life at sea.",
								"The southernmost region of Mirabilis is the Kupika Desert. Residents of the settlements in this area are famed for providing warm hospitality for those who have ventured through the unforgiving sand dunes.",
								"{@b Government}",
								"Mirabilis is led by an elected High Council of nine experts in their respective fields. There is widespread approval for these rulers, especially in the capital city of Laagehoven, the nexus of governmental power. While the current Council is considered firm but fair, history tells of some nefarious High Councillors who tried to use their power for selfish or sinister purposes.",
								"In smaller cities and large towns, it is common to find a mayor presiding over local affairs and enforcing the laws of the land. In the far reaches of Mirabilis, the state's authority is less robust. Discontent is found in pockets throughout the land, but there is no widespread support for rebellion.",
