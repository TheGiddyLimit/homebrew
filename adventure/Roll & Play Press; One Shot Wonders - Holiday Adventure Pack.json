Their thick fur hides powerful muscles, and each of their fingers ends in a retractable claw. Respect is hard to gain from a canisar, but they will defend their friends with tenacity and devotion.",
				"Canisars are covered in coarse fur that can vary between deep brown, grey, white, orange or black, which often comes with facial stripes or ringed markings. Most canisars live in woodland burrows, hidden beneath thick vegetation, mud or snow. Others roam the surface world, integrating into wider society while maintaining ties to their original burrows. Canisar culture is deeply ancestral, guided by reverence for family and lineage. Each canisar travels with stories and relics of their ancestors, and gives gifts to their friends and family throughout the year during different canisar festivals."

Their outer skin is made of thick bark that toughens with age, and beneath lies a network of green, sap-filled muscle. Twigs and berries sprout unpredictably, with the brightest clusters gathered around their heads. Their leaves and bark vary in colour, and are as diverse as the lands they live in.",
				"Hederans have extraordinary lifespans, with some reaching over a thousand years of age. Every two centuries or so, a hederan enters a rare blooming phase when the flowers on its body release pollen and a single silver seed forms upon its back. The seed must be planted within a week, or it will wither away, but from it a new hederan sapling will grow.",
				"Once planted by their parent, a hederan forms a deep bond with the soil of its homeland. They serve as guardians of winter forests, and maintain the balance of nature. Solitary by nature, they can live for centuries without meeting another of their kind, and no one knows how many exist across the world."

New snowborn have appeared and vanished over the years since their origin, yet the pattern of their life and rebirth remains a mystery even to them. Each fleeting snowborn lives for up to 20 years.",

Their dark-red noses can emit a gentle glow, often used for reading maps in dim light or signalling danger to their allies. Tarandus fur ranges from deep brown to pure white, shifting with age, climate or diet. They usually wear simple outfits, though more ornate garments and armour may be loaned to individuals by their herd in honour of taking on a specific role or responsibility.",
				"Their settlements are filled with map-halls and navigation schools, where trained explorers record the land, stars and seas with care. Some tarandus dedicate their lives to perfecting the art of map making, while others roam the world as scouts, guides or couriers, ensuring that their knowledge of routes and geography remains current.",
				"Tarandus herds are large and communal, sharing duties such as child-rearing and foraging. They maintain strong ties between herds through regular gatherings where new maps and discoveries are exchanged. As most tarandus are used to the safety and rhythm of herd life, those who travel alone often join adventuring groups as temporary companions."

								"Guardians of flourishing alpine forests, great fir drakes live peacefully among their saplings. Each day, the iridescent drakes use powerful magic to replenish their forest's soil and promote the growth of their beloved fir trees. Over the centuries, villagers and townsfolk have learned to live in peace with these largely benevolent beings.",
								"People who live near a great fir drake's lair can visit its forest home and leave the drake small shiny tokens under trees they wish to cut down. If the people return the next day to find the tokens have been gathered and taken, they know the great fir drake has given its blessing for those tree to be felled. In thanks, villagers decorate the trees with lights to resemble the drake. Those who fail to leave an offering for the drake's hoard and cut down its fir trees enrage the legendary creature, and should prepare to face its thrashing, needle-covered tail.",

Beyond that, little is known about their creation, though elemental magic was clearly involved. New snowborn have appeared and vanished over the years since their origin, yet the pattern of their life and rebirth remains a mystery even to them. Each fleeting snowborn lives for up to 20 years.",

Despite their coal eyes and carrot noses, they perceive the world as keenly as any other species. Snowborn enjoy using clothing as self-expression, like a jaunty hat or colourful scarf.",

								"All tarandus possess antlers that rise roughly a foot above their heads. Their dark-red noses can emit a gentle glow, often used for reading maps in dim light or signalling danger to their allies. Tarandus fur ranges from deep brown to pure white, shifting with age, climate or diet. They usually wear simple outfits, though more ornate garments and armour may be loaned to individuals by their herd in honour of taking on a specific role or responsibility.",
								"Their settlements are filled with map-halls and navigation schools, where trained explorers record the land, stars and seas with care. Some tarandus dedicate their lives to perfecting the art of map making, while others roam the world as scouts, guides or couriers, ensuring that their knowledge of routes and geography remains current.",
								"Tarandus herds are large and communal, sharing duties such as child-rearing and foraging. They maintain strong ties between herds through regular gatherings where new maps and discoveries are exchanged. As most tarandus are used to the safety and rhythm of herd life, those who travel alone often join adventuring groups as temporary companions.",

Their outer skin is made of thick bark that toughens with age, and beneath lies a network of green, sap-filled muscle. Twigs and berries sprout unpredictably, with the brightest clusters gathered around their heads. Their leaves and bark vary in colour, and are as diverse as the lands they live in.",
								"Hederans have extraordinary lifespans, with some reaching over a thousand years of age. Every two centuries or so, a hederan enters a rare blooming phase when the flowers on its body release pollen and a single silver seed forms upon its back. The seed must be planted within a week, or it will wither away, but from it a new hederan sapling will grow.",
								"Once planted by their parent, a hederan forms a deep bond with the soil of its homeland. They serve as guardians of winter forests, and maintain the balance of nature. Solitary by nature, they can live for centuries without meeting another of their kind, and no one knows how many exist across the world.",

Their thick fur hides powerful muscles, and each of their fingers ends in a retractable claw. Respect is hard to gain from a canisar, but they will defend their friends with tenacity and devotion.",
								"Canisars are covered in coarse fur that can vary between deep brown, grey, white, orange or black, which often comes with facial stripes or ringed markings. Most canisars live in woodland burrows, hidden beneath thick vegetation, mud or snow. Others roam the surface world, integrating into wider society while maintaining ties to their original burrows. Canisar culture is deeply ancestral, guided by reverence for family and lineage. Each canisar travels with stories and relics of their ancestors, and gives gifts to their friends and family throughout the year during different canisar festivals.",
