The two have always been happy, even after the death of Jooge's wife, Giselle, a few years ago-except that Jooge has no head for money and an excessive desire to experiment with new barbering techniques. One day, Jooge gave a haircut to a wandering {@creature Korred|vgm} named Bezoar. That strange fey creature became his regular customer, always coming to Jooge for cuts.",
								"Jooge was able to earn a bit of extra money by selling art objects made from Bezoar's hair cuttings, which the korred's magical nature transformed into the same high-quality steel as Jooge's scissors. Still, it wasn't nearly enough for him to be able to afford the {@creature flail snail|vgm} he saw offered for sale from a passing caravan. Jooge suspected correctly that the flail snail's colorful secretions could be used to make brilliant hair dyes, so he borrowed money from {@creature darkling|vgm} moneylenders to be able to afford the wondrous creature.",

The barbershop in this adventure is a \"traditional\" barbershop where haircuts, hairstyling, and a variety of surgical and dental operations are all performed."

When they couldn't, the moneylenders sold that debt to a strange woman-actually a dreadful {@creature annis hag|vgm} named Errevastica in disguise. The possessor of a malevolent magic item called the evil comb, the hag had long had her eye on Bezoar, and saw Jooge as a way to take control of the korred. The hag had become the leader of a group of xvarts by disguising herself as a beautiful female specimen that came to be known as \"Xvartette.\" Visiting Jooge, the hag quickly took control of him and used him to capture the korred.",

										"By brushing Bezoar's hair with the evil comb, Errevastica turned the korred's luxurious locks into evil, living, tentacle-like hair that now does her bidding. Furthermore, the hag knew that this particular korred had a secret magic beyond the natural magic of its kind. Not only does its cut hair transform into the material of the tool or implement that cut it, that hair transforms into a living creature when cut or torn by another living creature's teeth, claws, or hands! Since capturing Bezoar and imprisoning the korred under the watchful gaze of the xvarts, the hag has allowed the xvarts to tear apart clumps of his hair. Those clumps are transformed into new xvarts, rapidly increasing their numbers as fast as the korred's hair can grow.",
										"In a masterstroke of malevolence, the hag then forced Jooge to pull out two clumps of the korred's hair-one touched by the evil comb and one untouched. Those two clumps transformed into two new versions of Jooge: an evil version who is the hag's staunch ally, and a good version who was brainwashed to remove all memory of the hag.",
										"Now, while the original Jooge rots in the hag's dungeons below the barbershop, good Jooge runs the shop by day, using it as a cover for the hag's nefarious activities. Evil Jooge runs the shop by night, using it to capture unsuspecting prey. Some of the shop's victims are eaten by the hag or sacrificed by the xvarts in their dungeon below the shop. Others are used by evil  Jooge in his diabolical barbering experiments, and then destroyed or brainwashed and set free.",
										"Saddened by the mysterious changes in her father, yet thankfully unaware of all the evil goings-on below the shop, Jooge's daughter, Mops, spends most of the day alone in her room or playing in the garden. Her only friend is a {@creature boggle|vgm}, which is devoted to the young girl but lives in fear of Errevastica.",

Afraid to  rebel openly, he continues to ritually sacrifice whichever of evil Jooge's unsuccessful clients are not incinerated by the blow-dryer or eaten by the annis hag. In a pouch under his kilt he carries 75 gp, 300 cp, and three rubies worth 150 gp each."

								"This massive machine, which pulses visibly and radiates an aura of power, is evil Jooge's greatest invention. It taps into extradimensional forces to reach a dimension of pure color, where hues are the expression of primal forces beyond mortal understanding. The cavern walls around the ominous iron device are streaked with kaleidoscopic patterns and rainbow shades.",
								"It takes two creatures to successfully operate the {@i Prismatic Coloring Machine}: one to work the controls, and one to sit in the chair and have its hair done. Roll a d8 and determine the result below for the creature in the chair. (If evil Jooge is operating the machine, he can roll twice and use whichever result he wants.) Additionally, if the creature operating the machine is not a trained barber, it must succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check or the creature having its hair done has disadvantage on saving throws against the machine's effects.",
								"{@i {@b 1-Red}}. The creature must attempt a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 35 (10d6) fire damage. On a successful save, the creature's hair permanently transforms into fire. The creature gains resistance to fire damage and vulnerability to cold damage, and its fiery, glowing hair imposes permanent disadvantage on its Dexterity (Stealth) checks. Additionally, if the creature's hair is shoulder length or longer, it can use an action to shake its hair and cast {@spell burning hands} (no components required). Once the creature uses this feature, it cannot do so again until it finishes a short rest.",
								"{@i {@b 2-Orange}}. The creature must attempt a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 35 (10d6) acid damage. On a successful save, the creature's hair permanently transforms into an ooze. The creature gains resistance to acid damage. Additionally, if the creature's hair is shoulder length or longer, it can use a bonus action to make a melee attack against a target within 5 feet of it. On a hit, the attack deals 3 (ld6) plus Strength modifier bludgeoning damage and 3 (ld6) acid damage. If the creature's hair reaches the small of its back or is longer, this damage increases to 7 (2d6) plus Strength modifier bludgeoning damage and 7 (2d6) acid damage.",
								"The ooze hair is partly self-willed, and it might eat small organic objects-or creatures-that it can reach while its host is sleeping. Additionally, if the host creature dies, its consciousness enters the ooze hair. If the creature's body is not destroyed, the creature reincarnates 24 hours later as a {@creature gelatinous cube} or {@creature ochre jelly} (creature's choice; see the {@i Monster Manual} for both creatures). The reincarnated ooze has the original creature's memories, as well as its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores.",
								"{@i {@b 3-Yellow}}. The creature must attempt a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 35 (10d6) lightning damage. On a successful save, the creature's hair permanently transforms into a mass of electricity. The creature gains resistance to lightning damage, but its glowing, sparking hair imposes permanent disadvantage on its Dexterity (Stealth) checks. Additionally, the creature can use an action to shake its hair and cast {@spell shocking grasp} (no components required). Once the creature uses this feature, it can't do so again until it finishes a short rest.",
								"If the creature's hair reaches the small of its back or is longer, it can instead use an action to cast {@spell lightning bolt} (no components required). Once the creature uses this feature, it can't do so again until it finishes a long rest.",
								"{@i {@b 4-Green}}. The creature must attempt a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 35 (10d6) poison damage. On a successful save, the creature's skin turns green and scaly as it transforms permanently into a yuan-ti of your choice (typically a {@creature yuan-ti pureblood}; see the {@i Monster Manual}). If this transformation is imposed on a character, he or she must also succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or become permanently neutral evil.",
								"{@i {@b 5-Blue}}. The creature must attempt a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 35 (10d6) cold damage. On a successful save, the creature's hair permanently transforms into a mass of translucent ice crystals that are freezing cold to the touch. The creature gains resistance to cold damage. Additionally, if the creature's hair is shoulder length or longer, it can use an action to shake its hair and cast {@spell ice knife|xge} (no components required; see Xanathar's Guide to Everything). Once the creature uses this feature, it cannot do so again until it finishes a short rest.",
								"If the creature's hair reaches the small of its back or is longer, it can instead use an action to cast {@spell Snilloc's snowball swarm|xge} (no components required; see {@i Xanathar's Guide to Everything}). Once the creature uses this feature, it can't do so again until it finishes a long rest.",
								"{@i {@b 6-Indigo}}. The creature must attempt a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it turns to stone and is permanently petrified. Whether or not the creature turns to stone, its hair is transformed into a mass of glittering gems. This gem hair retains the flexibility and softness of normal hair until it is  cut, at which point it hardens. If all the creature's hair is cut, the resulting gems are worth 1d6 x 100 gp for short hair; 1d6 x 500 gp for shoulder-length hair; or 1d6 x 1,000 gp for hair that extends to the small of its back or is longer. If the creature is not petrified (or if it is returned to normal with {@spell greater restoration} or similar magic), its new hair grows back in as gems, allowing it to be repeatedly cut and sold at a frequency determined by the DM.",
								"{@i {@b 7-Violet}}. The creature must attempt a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it is permanently blinded. Whether or not the creature is blinded, its hair becomes a gateway to another plane of existence (the DM determines which plane). The size of the gateway, and what can fit through it, depends on the style and length of the creature's hair. Strange monsters might emerge through the creature's hair, and the creature and its allies might be able to enter the hair gate to explore the other plane.",
								"{@i {@b 8-Special}}. The target is hit by two colors. Roll twice more, rerolling any result of 8.",
								"Undoing Effects. The effects imposed by the {@i Prismatic Coloring Machine} can be undone only by a {@spell wish} spell (though creatures blinded or petrified by the machine can have those conditions removed by {@spell lesser restoration} and {@spell greater restoration}, as normal). With the exception of creatures affected by the machine's indigo setting, any affected creature that removes its hair by cutting, fire, acid, or any other means remains under the effects imposed by the machine.",
								"The {@i Prismatic Coloring Machine} is unstable. Each time it is used within a 24-hour period, there's a 10 percent cumulative chance that it explodes, hitting every creature within 60 feet of it with the effect of a {@spell prismatic spray} spell."

Errevastica is never in her true form, instead maintaining the illusion of being Xvartette, a 10-foot-tall, purple-skinned, female xvart of rare beauty (at least as far as the other xvarts are concerned). The hag always holds the {@i evil comb}, which she uses to groom Bezoar's ever-growing hair.",

Using the korred's hair to generate more of themselves, they hope eventually to create an army (led by Xvartette) capable of conquering all other races. They have no idea of the annis hag's true form, and would likely flee in panic if they saw it-as happens if Errevastica reverts to her true form after being killed in combat.",
								"Errevastica looks forward to seeing evil spread in Silverymoon-and to feast on the citizens and children of the city. Her xvarts have so far been engaging only in acts of stealthy robbery aboveground, but when her army is large enough, she plans to send it forth to engage in ever-greater acts of malice and murder. She encourages evil Jooge's experiments but keeps one eye on him, wary that he might become too powerful.",

It has the same magical effects as the smaller {@i evil comb} that evil Jooge created (see {@area 3A|3A.
