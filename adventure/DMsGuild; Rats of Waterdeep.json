She traced this 'Lady of Plagues' to an apothecary on the docks: a front for the druid's plague laboratory. Here she learned that her enemy was trialing the virus on criminals and murderers: the same foes the Rat King brawled with each night. Rather than fight her, Catarina reached out to the Lady of Plagues, and found a kindred spirit called Maladie Song.",

As the Rat King hunted anew for the Lady of Plagues, Catarina's father conducted his own investigations through the district's seedier taverns. He discovered that the Xanathar crime boss had stolen and unleashed Maladie's plague, and was using the outbreak to smuggle slaves into the city through the docks. The old captain arranged a covert meeting with the port authorities, but before he could act on it, the Xanathar's minions murdered him and pinned the crime on his own daughter, the Rat King.",
