								"Epic-level D&D is, well, epic. By the time characters are approaching the level cap they become capable of more and more incredible feats, and though 5th edition has scaled things down somewhat the party still begins to function on a level far removed from that of normal men and women.",

								"In short, it's something that every gamer should get to play around with at least once.",

								"At the same time, the DM will need to be a little more prepared than usual. Running a game at this level requires you to be able to think on your feet, as characters will be capable of feats that can suddenly take the adventure in an entirely unexpected direction. Even the greatest DMs in the world can be a little flummoxed when the Wizard decides that an Arcane Gate sounds like a better idea than actually fighting the dragon blocking their path.",

At the very moment of their death, these titanic heroes are plucked from their own time by a powerful angel and tasked with saving the world - and possibly much more besides - one last time.",

She has launched a plan that she claims will save the material plane from its insidious tendrils, but exactly how effective this will be and how catastrophic its side effects is yet to become clear...",

They were summoned here around a day ago and there have been fairly regular incursions from Mindflayers and other creatures of the Far Realms since then.",
