And Defroksanz made sure to make Quabus one of the most formidable dungeons in all of Omeria. The first level of Quabus was its prison. Defroksanz's minions would capture commoners across The Summer Land and inter them there. Next, came the death trap second level, Violent Delights. Defroksanz and his associates would watch their prisoners try to escape the deadly obstacle course, watching them on viewing screens. Finally, the third level acted as Defroksanz's research and development center.  There, the dragon expended its sorcerous energies to unlock the mysteries of the Cosmos.",

The dungeon was rediscovered by one of Defroksanz's descendants, Skuvan the Firesoul Skuvan cleared a path to the old scrying temple on Violent Delights. However, neither he nor any of his minions dared go below the second layer.",

The spirit of the dungeon's former owner now searches the ruins of his old laboratories for a way to return to life through lichdom.

Dambudzo was obsessed with Loikiel, the Archtransmuter Conquerer who nearly destroyed all of Omeria in the 7th century. Having fled her homeland after being chased away by the witchhunters, she was kidnapped by Defroksanz and his minions. Proving her worth, she convinced the dragon to give her a position as a researcher. After a year of impressive service, Defroksanz promoted Dambudzo to the director of arcane research and expanded Quabus so she could expand her studies.",

The potion gave her eternal life, but it also changed her into a frightful monster. Plus, the transformation drove her insane.

Similarly, effects that banish creatures to another plane of existence do not work. These restrictions apply to magic items and artifacts as well However, spells that allow movement between The Ethereal such as the {@spell etherealness} spell still work.

However, spells cast within those spaces are subjected to the same restrictions as the rest of the dungeon. Finally, the dungeon, its contents, and any creature currently inside the dungeon cannot be detected by divination spells or magical effects used outside the dungeon. Spells such as {@spell locate object} or {@spell scrying} simply fail. The same goes for magic items that duplicate those effects or innate tracking features such as an invisible stalker's Faultless Tracker feature.
