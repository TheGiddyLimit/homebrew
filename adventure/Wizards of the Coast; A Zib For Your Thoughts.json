Alternatively, it can be disabled with one successful casting of {@spell dispel magic} (DC 13) targeting the coils. If the coils are disabled, it disables the coil discharge elements as well as the explosion dynamic element. The emitter is still active, receiving some power from the matrix. Creatures that attempt this are subject to the coil discharge constant element if they end their turn next to the power matrix."

It can be spotted with a successful DC 10 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check if someone is looking for something else notable in the lab. This is securely locked, requiring two successful DC 20 Dexterity checks with {@item thieves' tools|phb}, two successful DC 16 Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) checks, or 20 points of damage with a magic weapon to break open. Once opened, a switch can be thrown to shut down the matrix, disabling all elements of the trap."
