				"Whether on well-trodden roads in civilized lands or in remote, half-forgotten places there exist taverns which cater specifically to travelers. These roadside establishments often provide a welcome respite from yet another night sleeping on the ground. They are often converted farmhouses with easy access to gardens, farmer's markets, and places to find wild game. Sometimes such a place will act like a community center or post office for the scattered inhabitants of the region."
