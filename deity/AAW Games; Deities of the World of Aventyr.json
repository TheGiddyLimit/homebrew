				"{@b Introduction}",
				"The Axiomatic General is the god of those who use the self-evident and unquestionable power of law to further a cause. Most frequently this is during war, where neither the unhelpful morality of good and evil nor the confusion and disorder of chaos allow for clear decisions to be made and victory achieved.",
				"The Axiomatic General appears wherever clear-thinking, considered tactics, and balanced plans are being prepared or followed. While the field of war is the usual site for these activities, the Axiomatic General has been known to appear during complicated but emotionless court cases, and sometimes even when the cold, detached clarity of true monkish enlightenment is reached. The Axiomatic General is neither male nor female, instead being a creature devoid of physically distracting bias. It can appear as a female or male of any humanoid species, whichever form is most likely to aid with clarity of decision making.",
				"{@b Dogma}",
				"The Axiomatic General and its followers wish to bring the clarity of law to those places that currently live in emotional turmoil, and to demonstrate to all the axiomatic nature of law when applied to war, legal frameworks, and personal actions. It expects it believers to instigate and adhere to meaningful laws while at the same time exposing and amending those which are ludicrous, outlandish, convoluted, unenforceable, or contrary. The Overseer of War abhors any decision or process that allows an individual to take unfair advantage of another, either through methods such as emotional blackmail, the abuse of personal power, or as a result of chance. It encourages its followers to engage in long-term ordered \"wars\" rather than short-and-sharp fights\u2014the chaos of battle is well known, but by carefully considering one's options, testing one's theories, and then following through with a well-conceived plan, one can make their way to victory in an ordered manner. If all around them are clear about their intentions, one can see their actions are as fair and just as possible, and that trade and public prosperity, the courts, and the growth of society as a whole can continue during even the greatest of conflicts. The Lord of All Wars promotes careful consideration in all matters and expects its followers to be able to provide self-evident truths for all their actions. Haste, guesswork, and self-indulgence lead to reliance on emotion and base, uncontrolled actions. It disapproves of reliance on government or any religious institution that fosters blind trust or, even worse, unprovable belief, explaining that those with sound judgement, mental discipline, and an unshakeable grasp of sensible, irrefutable laws can overcome the inauthentic evidence and invalid arguments of the emotional and chaotic masses.",
				"{@b History}",
				"Once a mortal humanoid, the Axiomatic General ascended to become deified, although it is unclear what exactly it once was as virtually all races have a legendary historical figure that has risen from the mortal ranks to those of the divine after following the path of a great warrior who tirelessly supported its deity. What is evident is that the Overseer of War became more powerful than this original deity and ended up judging it at the culmination of a long conflict. The Lord of All War's final verdict and victory provided the energy and evidence needed for the warrior to rise to godhood itself. The Axiomatic General tends to appear in history (as the simple warrior of its humanoid type) when the race's pre-eminent lawful deity first wages war against more than one non-lawful foe, whether they be good, evil, or chaotic. It goes by many titles (a few of which appear above) but always has the ability to make clear, concise, and entirely accurate decisions even in the heat and fog of combat. Tales invariably tell of the Overseer of War having to uphold the lawful aims and ambitions of another deity's followers when the god or goddess itself proves to be weak and fallible. Then the Axiomatic General steps in to save those same worshipers before judging the god in question and finding it wanting. After this it takes the fight to the enemy, turns the tide of the war with unquestionable judgement, and becomes a deity in its own right. After this the Lord of All Wars is always found leading those who know its words to be the truth through conflict, disagreement, and dispute\u2014a reliable route to absolute, undeniable victory.",
				"{@b Relationships}",
				"The Overseer of Warl is entirely dismissive of any and all other deities that do not in some part embrace lawful beliefs. While those that promote chaos feel its full wrath, the Axiomatic General constantly seeks to disprove the tenets of neutral good and neutral evil deities because of their reliance on sentimental or self-centered emotions. It tolerates lawful good and lawful evil gods as long as their lawful nature is at the forefront of their actions, and is just as likely to support a lawfully-minded archon in a conflict against an evil devil as it is a lawfully-minded devil that wages war against an overly-good archon; ultimately, the balance of law is what is important.",
				"The Axiomatic General is opposed by all those who promote personal choice, uncontrolled actions, and \"belief\"\u2014it is guaranteed to come into conflict with deities that support and nurture bards and barbarians, and frequently with those that nurture wild sorcerers. Because it is so closely linked with conclusive and categorical truth, the Lord of All Wars sometimes finds itself on the side of sages, experts, philosophers and academics that devote their lives to uncovering a lost or hidden truth, whether military, legal, commercial, or magical.",
				"{@b Appearance}",
				"The Axiomatic General usually appears as a healthy, vibrant member of the appropriate race and can be either female or male (or neither). Its clothing is always practical for the situation but is clearly designed to instil confidence and invariably a bright white. The god's symbol, the decorated iron rod, is sewn into the space above the heart and mimicked by the weapon it wields. The Overseer of War always carries a {@i +3 axiomatic brilliant energy light mace}, the look and effect of which is in line with the main domain of the senior cleric in the vicinity as follows:",

				"Legends dictate that the Axiomatic General occasionally appears as a fully advanced, adamantine-coated marut, but the last occasion this was recorded was many generations ago.",
				"{@b Providence}",
				"Followers and clergy of the Lord of All Wars know that clarity of planning, deeper understanding of the way forward, or insight into a problem that has been gained after careful thought and consideration has come from their deity. This knowledge doesn't appear suddenly but is the reward for taking time and exploring all possibilities. The Oversee of War thinks highly of those who consider their options before acting decisively, as well as of those who follow through with long-term plans without faltering.",
				"Any sign of plans failing, confusion reigning, or participants not understanding their role is seen as a sign that the Axiomatic General is displeased and expects greater discipline and forethought.",
				"{@b Servants}",
				"The Axiomatic General rewards those who organize well and keep to agreed plans, no matter how long this may take. These machinations often take many generations in the case of shorter-lived humanoids such as goblinoids and humans, or the entire life of the longest-living elves. Servants must be prepared to sacrifice the immediate for the longer term, understand that they may lose those around them today for the betterment of a lawful population tomorrow, and recognize that the needs of a lawful future outweigh any considerations here and now.",
				"The Overseer of War grants particular favor to those who constantly uphold the law\u2014inevitables are viewed with esteem alongside formians and other hive-minded creatures. Followers that devote themselves to a lifetime of achieving a long-term lawful aim regularly receive insight and clarity from their god. Humanoids that either spend a significant portion of their time gaining greater insight into a particular path or are able to rapidly judge the features and benefits of a number of possibilities before quickly making the correct decision often gain a divine hint or two.",
				"{@b The Church of the Axiomatic General}",
				"Sites of worship to the Lord of All Wars serve one purpose: to ensure that correct decisions are made to further indisputable truth. They range in size from an officer's table in their tent, a simple sand tablet on which a cleric explains a truth, or in a lawyer's or sage's rooms, to the chambers of a country's most magnificent courtroom, the order flags at the front line of the latest battle in a war, or the grandest library within the Klavek Kingdom's most spectacular cathedral to the Axiomatic General. Churches to this god are all simple, plain affairs that remove mental distraction and clutter at the same time as allowing axioms and tenets spoken by the Overseer of War to be spread effectively and efficiently.",
				"Worship of the Axiomatic General is frequently silent as followers consider practical issues at hand as well as long-term problems that require a more considered solution. Followers frequently engage in debates, most of which are serious but enjoyable affairs\u2014there is no time for frivolous thought when the Lord of All War's tenets are involved\u2014although there is no sense of \"victory or defeat\" in these sessions (the aim is to reach the truest, most accurate solution to a question, and everybody learns something.) When necessary, churches of the Overseer of War provide a neutral meeting point between warring factions of good and evil, although only the most experienced and senior of clergy attempt to mediate between chaotic elements. The Axiomatic General has shown that the wisest course for followers of law is to work together to overcome chaos through any means possible before resolving philosophical and personal lawful differences using contemplation and debate.",
				"The clergy of the Overseer of War organize themselves in a clear and obvious hierarchy in the same way that any modern military, business, or courtroom would do. Similarly, religious and educational centers that follow the Axiomatic General have a plain structure in place that shows who has best demonstrated an understanding of the god's aims and objectives. No matter where or how the Lord of All War is followed, its churches are defined by their grasp of unequivocal truths, of unimpeachable laws, unbeatable tactics, and unquestionable enlightenment. Churches that exhibit knowledge over belief and can demonstrate undeniable evidence for these truths have the greatest standing, no matter what their size. Worshipers rise up the ranks in the same way: anyone who can establish irrefutable knowledge and information is given ever greater responsibilities. At the same time, mistakes aren't considered failure if the individuals concerned can show they did all they could to establish clarity and a considered answer. All they have to do is recognize that further investigation has produced better knowledge and make sure they don't repeat the mistake. As the Lord of All Wars is happy to develop plans over many generations, errors that can be rectified bear little consequence.",
				"Churches worshiping the Axiomatic General are openly found in the center of lawful societies and towards the outskirts of those populations with no preference for law or chaos, but are seemingly absent from chaotic cultures. The Overseer of War prefers his followers to surround such cultures and gradually move inwards until the chaos is crushed out of them\u2014a process that takes as long as is necessary, designed to ensure no worshiper is tricked into joining chaos from within.",
				"Services to the Axiomatic General are ordered affairs, comprising either contemplation of the truth or respectful presentation of findings and subsequent decision-making they influence. In all situations there is ample opportunity for everyone who wants to speak to do so, although followers recognize the need to act swiftly during war situations and develop a truncated, precise style of presenting their findings.",
				"{@b Worshipers}",
				"The Axiomatic General is primarily worshiped by military officers but also draws in judges, lawyers, barristers, sages, monks, and those who would advance society in an ordered and structured way. Those who indulge in chaotic thoughts and acts are ignored at all times.",
				"{@b Clergy}",
				"The clergy of the Overseer of War are not necessarily clerics, although if they aren't they are only allowed to represent the god within their own sphere of expertise and influence (for example, military officers can only lead services and discussions about military matters). Any member of the clergy who is a cleric is required to lead a service in an overarching capacity even if the content is decided by the senior subject expert. In all situations the most experience cleric leads a service, with assistance as appropriate from other members of the congregation.",
				"The Axiomatic General does not support paladins, despite their martial outlook. Their tendency towards good leads them to not always consider the balanced needs of a lawful life, which in turn means their judgment isn't always going to be the best it can be in some situations.",
				"{@b Temples and Shrines}",
				"Buildings devoted to the Lord of All Wars are functional, unadorned, designed to serve all aspects of the god's tenets, yet clearly focused on one domain more than others (whatever that may be). It isn't unusual for there to be four temples next to each other\u2014one for each aspect of devotion with followers visiting whichever is most appropriate for their needs.",
				"All sites of worship have one item in common: a magical lead box with an amazing lock that holds a copy of the four holy texts of the Axiomatic General (The Four Planes of Certain Truth) plus one additional book of specific thoughts on the area of expertise of the congregation. These boxes are identical as adornment or elaboration is forbidden as an unnecessary distraction, and are always at the center of any service of worship or decision-making process. Whenever the box is locked after its final use for the day, the text within each book is updated via divine intervention if a more accurate and truthful version of any piece of information has been discovered and when new facts have been uncovered.",
				"Each place of worship also contains the thought processes of anyone who has worked to uncover indisputable truths, as well as the evidence that demonstrates that truth. Whenever someone is uncovering a new truth, their work-in-progress materials are stored here as well.",
				"{@b Holy Texts}",
				"The Four Planes of Certain Truth contain the pertinent and unequivocal statements confirmed by the Axiomatic General. When stored in their magical box they are updated via divine intervention when it is locked at the end of the day. No decision is made without this box being present, even if it isn't used. Clerics of the Overseer of War receive notification of changes as part of their meditation; all clerics and service leaders are encouraged to learn the texts by heart (as interpretation isn't required).",
				"Each book bears a simple cover, binding, and little decoration other than an iron rod over a stylized letter that identifies its contents. Other documents stored at temples and shrines have these two symbols plus the initials of the author and the date of publication. When any document is superseded, the date of its relegation from cannon is stamped on the cover and the original symbols scored through.",

Chapters give details on what to do before, during, and after meditation, as well as how to realize enlightenment has been reached. They also describe how our contemplation can be lessened by the actions of others, but how these digressions can be overcome and enlightenment eventually reached."

				"{@b Holidays}",
				"The Axiomatic General is not celebrated at any specific festivals. Instead when the law prevails during any of the god's areas of interest, followers offer a prayer of thanks no more than 30 minutes after the event. If gratitude is shown later than this, it probably means the follower was distracted from the task in hand and has acted in a chaotic way to make the thanks fit in. Better to acknowledge the effect of the Overseer of War with one's body and mind than take yourself away from a pressing matter and make two situations chaotic."

				"{@b Introduction}",
				"Balir is considered to be first among dwarves, yet least among gods - a mortal hero granted divinity through his great actions and heroic sacrifices.",
				"{@b History}",
				"Balir's mortal life began as a dweorg, a remnant of the once great race from which all dwarves stemmed. He was dissatisfied; dwarves had become a lesser race, overcome by the drow, among others. His life was punctuated by constant struggle and heroic feats that are the things of legend: he re-mastered the lost arts of metalworking once known by his ancestors; he defended his homeland single-handedly against creatures of the Underworld; and he built himself a flawless suit of unbreakable armor. Inside this shell he was an unstoppable force, and Balir took back thousands of miles of once-dwarven lands. He rose higher than any before making the fatal flaw of offering his hand in peace to the drow.",
				"The story goes that the drow cast a curse of burning into his unbreakable armor, sealing the dwarf inside and setting it ablaze forever. But in this moment the gods saw Balir as the greatest martyr of his people and granted him a spark of divinity; he awoke as a god, still within the armor that had become his tomb, and departed the mortal realm.",
				"Having risen from the ranks of mortals, Balir has been forced to prove himself to the gods over and over again, showing them he is worthy. His feats as a god are no less than his feats as a mortal, although they take place in realms far beyond man's comprehension. It is from one of these divine toils that he claimed his mighty hammer, Soul Forger - a weapon clearly claimed from a creature many times larger than Balir himself.",
				"Even as he found himself a god, Balir kept his destroyed mortal form as a sign of his penance. Instead of divine flesh, he constructed a metal body for himself to replace the one he lost. This new skin is without the flaw of mercy that destroyed him as a mortal. And although Balir's scarred face is unmistakably dwarven, his body is anything but. Cast of white mithral and black iron, he appears more machine than man. Now, even with his drow-cursed armor destroyed, he still blazes with the murderous fire; in his chest, he carries a spark from which the sun was born. When he does not appear in his divine form, Balir assumes the guise of a young dwarf, typically bearing scars on his face and arms from flame.",
				"{@b Churches, Clergy, and Worshippers}",
				"Churches to Balir are at once humble and magnificent. Their areas of worship are simple and unadorned, although always practical, in a manner befitting dwarven life itself. Whether the smallest shrine or grandest cathedral, sites dedicated to Balir always stand near a place of work, of toil, and of creation. In them, they are guided by Balir's ancient knowledge and secrets to produce machines, mechanical goods, and works of active art unlike anywhere else in the world. Balir's clergy are predominantly dwarven, although some humans do acclaim to his faith as well. Where they can, they dress in mithral and crimson - styling themselves after their god. Poorer members of the faith dress instead in white and yellow. Worshippers almost always offer constructed items as their offering. If they do resort to just money, it's always directed toward a newly-qualified crafter, or a promising apprentice.",
				"{@b Holy Text}",
				"The {@i Life of Balir} is unlike any standard book of holy teachings. Instead, this tome is almost three thousand pages long and details the thousand trials and tribulations of Balir's life, written in such a way that it is more like a dwarven self-help book than divine instruction. Some versions have additional volumes discussing the merits of each action Balir took, although these are known to be opinion, not fact. The original text is unchanged from when it was penned by Balir's own son, after the dwarf's ascension to godhood."

Its motives are totally unpredictable, though it strikes swiftly and without warning when it is suited to do so.

When wound or unwound underwater, these magical cords play hymns of the Current's religion (in a tongue those that hear them can understand).

				"Hivaka was the last daughter of five children born to a minor drow house, House Ruim, in the city of Xdot. Her mother, Laelstra, was the Matron's personal seeress. Hivaka possessed only the slightest of her mother's magical abilities, mastering cantrips at an early age, but progressing no further. Being the youngest daughter, barely older than her only brother, and her sisters already being groomed for succession to various positions within the House, Hivaka found herself being used as leverage but almost everyone around her.",
				"Hivaka's father, Elkerd, was first son of House Kilduis, allies of House Ruim. Among Elkerd's vices was gambling\u2014he never minded losing, as long as fun was had by all. The problems began when he started using House Kildius' assets to cover his wagers. When he was financially cut off from House Kilduis, he took the step of offering his youngest daughter, Hivaka, to the winner of a game of orbben. When Elkerd lost to Imfein of House Rilyntyl, rival of House Kilduis, Hivaka was taken from her home by force. Laelstra protested, but there were too many reliable witnesses to the wager for her challenges to hold sway over her Matron. Thus, Hivaka was taken into slavery by House Rilyntyl. Laelstra attempted to buy Hivaka from Imfein, but was rebuffed, as having a bargaining chip against House Kilduis' ally was was worth much more than gold.",
				"Aside from the hard labor she and many others were forced to endure, Hivaka was treated well\u2014as well as a slave could be treated, anyway. She took her enforced servitude in stride, seeing as how she had almost never held any power of significance in her life. However, she harbored a hatred for her father, not understanding how a parent could blithely hand over their child's life to another simply to cover a bet.",
				"The guards from House Imfein did not treat her any better or any worse than any of the other slaves. Neither did they prohibit her mother from visiting her occasionally during the evening, as long as no escape attempts were made. They did, however, restrain her from braining her father with her work hammer the one and only time he approached her during a shift of breaking up rocks. If not for the guards, Elkerd would have died violently, but possibly not quickly.",
				"Hivaka was a slave of House Imfein for almost a full year before Laelstra recruited a large following and put a plan into action that would free Hivak: she and her cohort would attack the Imfein guards at the slave pens during the night and Hivak would escape in the confusion while wearing the battle-dress of a House Imfein sorceress.",
				"The assault appeared to be a success as chaos reigned in the slave pens, however, Laelstra had not anticipated two things: first, there were more guards than anticipated, causing longer holdups and more casualties as the attacking mob progressed. More guards also meant that an alarm could be sounded, bringing reinforcements, which compounded the existing issues with the rescue.",
				"The second issue was that Hivaka had determined that no matter where she was in drow society, she would be enslaved. Either to another house or within her own, where she would be used as a pawn in countless numbers of schemes by her Matron and her own family. As the youngest daughter, she held the lowest standing. Because of this, she was determined not to return to her home.",
				"Once in possession of the Imfein battle dress, Hivaka pulled the attached hood over her head and began leading slaves away, using her implied authority, along with some well placed and spectacular looking cantrips, to move them without interference. She had nearly one hundred slaves with her when they left the Xdot border.",
				"Leading them on through the night, Hivaka found a narrow cave entrance that led into a larger cavern inside. Using the last of her available magicks, Hivaka attempted to cover the mouth of the cave with an illusion showing solid rock. The image was far more effective than Hivak knew because she and her group had attracted the attention of Leacim, the only known male drow deity.",
				"A trickster among the more serious drow goddesses, Leacim took this opportunity to thumb his nose as his sisters and to have fun, watching at the drow patrols searched the area over and over, never seeing past his illusions.",
				"The rescued slaves began worshipping Hivaka as a savior. She resisted their praise, saying that she was simply another slave, like them. Leacim\u2014knowing that these slaves needed someone to look up to, invested a small amount of his power in Hivaka, raising her above the mortals, but not so high as the divine: he made her a demigoddess.",
				"Those under her protection turned their new home into a town, called Nhlilolin, which has become a haven for the outcasts of the Underworld.",
				"{@b Appearance}",
				"Hivaka is short, for a drow, but heavily muscled from her time as a slave. Her light gray hair is kept short for a drow female, the ends reaching her jawline. Her eyes are blue, relatively rare in the Underworld, and if you look into them, you will find nothing but a steely resolve.",
				"Hivaka keeps her clothes simple, preferring pants and shirts that have pockets. The more pockets, the better. She is never anywhere without the hammer that she used to break the chains of the other slaves before leading them off into the night. Every morning or after any combat, she repairs the wooden handle with the {@i mending} cantrip.",
				"{@b Church of Hivaka}",
				"Hivaka, as a very recent demigoddess does not have a church, but those that were rescued from imprisonment literally sing her praises every day. She downplays her role as a savior or someone to be worshipped. She does have her devoted followers and, thanks to Leacim, she is able to grant them a small number of spells. She has not gained any paladins, though.",
				"{@b Worshippers and Clergy}",
				"Those who escaped with Hivaka are her greatest worshippers, but any who have escaped bondage freely speak her name with reverence. There is no set clery in Nhilolin, but some apostles go out into the Underworld (and a few to the Upperworld) and speak against slavery, striving to free those that are held down, if only through word if not deed.",
				"Some of these preachers will gather the like-minded with them and attempt to free those taken by slavers. These zealots do not care if they live or die, as long as those imprisoned go free.",
				"{@b Holy Text}",
				"{@i The Journey:} The only text that Hivaka doesn't simply shake her head at is {@i The Journey}. This collection of parchments is the story of not only Hivaka leading the slaves of House Imfein to freedom, but every person who has escaped from an overlord is welcome to add their story to The Journey. So far, almost three hundred stories have been put into the collection.",
				"A second \"holy text\" has begun circulating throughout Nhilolin and the Underworld, speaking of Hivaka in the holiest of languages, greatly exaggerating her abilities, and almost, but not quite, painting her as the goddess who will eventually overthrow the mightiest of slavers, Naraneus herself. Hivaka has tried to explain that the book, {@i The Light of Hivaka and the Way Forward}, brings attention to her and the town, which is mentioned by name in the book, and could lead to them all being recaptured. This explanation has failed, so far."

Little is known to her followers of her true origins, only that she has proven to be an active and loyal spiritual force within the lives of those who never looked away from the older forms of worship.",
				"Ja Qua exists within a sub-dimension connected to the mainlands of the Seelie Court, and has fostered a deep relationship with the fey of her lands, looking upon them with the same love and care as her human followers.

				"{@b Appearance}",

The first being that of a monstrously large and physically powerful jaguar, golden tawny in color with spots that appear to shift and move before one's eyes. Crowned with a rim of bony protrusions across her brow and snout, there is no mistaking Ja Qua in her feline form as the self-appointed Queen of her lands. Her second form is one of far more subtlety, one of an attractive woman, typically still keeping the tawny color of her pelt within her long hair. The color of her eyes in human form is said to be indescribable, as no true color exists within nature to compare them to, and her voice will both seduce and petrify you with fear in the same instant.",

				"Those tribal warriors deemed worthy are put through a ritualistic challenge to earn Ja Qua's Blessing, the gift of lycanthropy. Those who survive the process of transformation, and are not driven mad by the ritualistic pain they must go through to prove their worth find themselves in a position of honor amongst the tribes and temples, utilized as guardians and hunters, protecting both the faith and an ancient way of life. Dressed in only a loincloth these warriors tend to embrace the custom of adorning themselves with colorful trinkets and baubles to mark victories over adversaries, or glorious hunts.",
				"Those of great enough faith, but not physical stamina to serve the tribes as warriors tend the temples and altars of Ja Qua as her loyal clerics. Over time those of the deepest devotion begin to acquire certain feline traits, though they never achieve the full embrace of Ja Qua as the temple warriors do.",
				"{@b Holy Text}",
				"Scattered throughout the jungle are many lost ruins of forgotten tribes, within which are wall carvings and bas-reliefs depicting the teachings of various points in the history of the church of Ja Qua.

				"A skald of some renown, Theo Dralman was quested by the Grand University of Mohkba to enter the dark jungle and learn all he could of the spirits to which the native people prayed, and how the Klavek Kingdom could use this information to its own end. That was many years ago, and many of the legends spoken amongst the tribes that have encountered Dralman would lead one to believe that his goals have changed, and his search for knowledge has become something far more personal. Most of the legends speak of a man carrying a great many scars, as if he had been mauled to the edge of death, only to be spared and shown a new path. There exist a few rare copies of his incomplete work, taken to the coastal towns by couriers and those on safari...the Dralman Documents they have become known as. All public possession of these documents within the borders of Klavekian controlled lands is considered treasonous and punishable by seizure of properties and goods, as well as incarceration"

Once a treasured god of cunning and wisdom, he was left bereft in the void of the cosmos\u2014when Leacim stared into the void, something from the far beyond stared back. Now slightly deranged and without an identity, the god capered throughout the universe with a will and desire at the whim of his growing insanity.",
				"Eventually, the divine energies wrought on Aventyr during the Forging of the Dvergr caught Leacim's attention, drawing him to the periphery of the world to witness the rise of the progenitors their fall into the draaki. It was the elven deities, however, that most interested the god of misfortune\u2014over hundreds of years, he subtly infiltrated their pantheon and species, attributing fanatical devotees in the very flesh before spreading them across both Upper- and Underworld. He appeared inexplicably among the elven pantheon, fully adopting the drow form and gathering followers both before and after their exodus from Edhellond.",
				"The most famous of these followers is Hivak, the Savior of the Masses. Leacim took notice when she and her fellow slaves took flight from Xdot. He imparted the aspiring dark elf with some of his divine essence, forever transforming her into a demigoddess.",
				"Leacim continues to take an active (albeit underhanded) role in the continued existence of the drow. He travels through the Underworld, briefly touching the souls of dark elves and morphing their alignments towards chaos, neutrality or even goodness if it suits his mood. The lone raider D'thul, a cannibalistic sorcerer-barbarian in the Fungi Forest near Holoth, is one such drow. Those on the surface often see their lives subtly influenced by the trickster god, and Leacim leads them to roles of dubious natures and unexpected rewards.",
				"{@b Special}",
				"Leacim takes delight in angering the other drow gods at every opportunity; his followers may substitute Leacim as the required diety for any item, class, feat or spell that has a drow deity requirement and may select the Drow domain if they have access to domains. Moreover, he often creates his own agents of change\u2014players that wish to play a drow of good alignment in a place that would otherwise prohibit that choice may choose Leacim as their deity to avoid that caveat.",
				"{@b Appearance}",
				"The trickster god has numerous guises but he most commonly appears as an affably dressed male half-drow with an alluring grin or a blonde human girl, regardless of form, both have piercing blue eyes. Leacim's clothing is generally fashionable and appropriate for the environment, though it is sometimes slightly tattered and seemingly in a state of disrepair. He casually saunters seemingly without a care in the world, a scimitar on his side and black-lacquered shortbow across his back, in female form he carries only a single knife as a weapon which always returns to him when thrown.",
				"{@b Shrines to the Trickster}",
				"Leacim doesn't have proper churches\u2014effigies and the like are hidden in plain sight or are places of secret pilgrimage. These shrines are often made to look like they belong to other deities, and only show their true forms when the correct prayers are uttered. Followers that fail a DC 28 Knowledge (religion) check find their god distempered with them after praying at one of these shrines, though they remain unsure as to why (regardless of any divination spells they cast).",
				"{@b Holy Text}",
				"{@i Leacim's Lexicon} is a treasured tome among thieves' guilds, hidden drow enclaves and the trickster god's followers.

				"This otherworldly god is much like the hoyrall once were\u2014a massive hive mind. More than a physical being, as the insectoids came to dominate the planet of the alien god's origin, Zagnexis manifested as the congealed consciousness of their dead. While the other intelligent lifeforms on that world fought valiantly, with a deific being directing the racial hive mind of the hoyrall, they quickly came to rule over all that the insect god could perceive.",
				"Until the Great Schism. The progenitors, cast down from their once mythic forms into the lowly race now known as the draaki, made a desperate cry to the cosmos and it was Zagnexis that answered their plea. Mustering the unimaginable power granted from the complete devotion of an entire race of creatures, the insect god transported his entire physical for into Aventyr\u2014Zagn, along with tens of thousands of hoyrall\u2014directly across the universe and into the Dracoprime's skull, killing the draconic monstrosity instantly.",
				"For some generations, Exis continued to direct its children on Aventyr, growing a massive army within the fortress-hives of the hoyrall in preparation for an all-out assault to conquer both the surface and the Underworld. Were it not for the intervention of the colloid during The Confluence, it surely would have succeeded. The other alien entity seized upon Exis conduit to its children, breaking the hive mind of the hoyrall and sending its physical counterpart, Zagn, careening into the oceans of Aventyr to wreck havoc upon everything it meets.",
				"Since then, Exis has retained what connections it can to Aventyr, granting powers to its clerics and oracles but little more. The alien god wants nothing more than to expand and procreate, increasing its deific power by generating a second world of followers. Exis is avaricious and without regard for the general balance of natural powers; it will stop at nothing to re-establish its hold over both Zagn and the hoyrall before consuming all of Aventyr.",
				"{@b Appearance}",
				"Exis is a spectral insect composed of dozens of different arthropods, its countless limbs, heads, eyes and antennae constantly morphing into new shapes or variations. Zagn is an enormous, multi-headed (and multi-mouthed) segmented worm with thousands upon thousands of legs that span a body measured by miles.",
				"{@b Church of Zagnexis}",
				"Temples, churches and shrines devoted to the alien god are commonly found throughout the fortress-hives of the hoyrall and honeycombed into Upperworld mountains, but most are in terrible states of disrepair. The unrest following The Confluence led to the dissolution of hoyrall society, and the sites of worship to the god that once bound them all together were quickly targeted by dissenters and ne'er-do-wells. New churches to Zagnexis are well-appointed and carefully kept, tiled with the carapace of insects in exquisite mosaics that depict the journey of the hoyrall.",
				"{@b Holy Text}",
				"There is no written or oral tradition to the worship of Zagnexis; lesser followers are taught the rites of worship through nonverbal communication (through limbs or antennae), and acolytes meld their minds with greater priests in ritual-driven meldings of the minds. Only this devout form of communication is fit for the transmission of the holiest information known to the worshippers of the insect god."

				"{@b History}",
				"The moment the universe was born, the miraculous burst of light and life was the unconscious dream of Mercuria's mother in another dimension. Mercuria began much as an infant does and how the universe did, small and without knowledge or wisdom and in her case, no one to instruct her. Much of her life and that of Aventyr's came to be due to luck, a strange force Mercuria found within herself and motes (some hidden in music) scattered throughout the universe. As she grew and matured, Lady Luck found that she could control the outcome of events, especially those of a chaotic and free nature simply by willing it so, and it wasn't long before those in perilous and astounding situations would begin to call upon her for help. There's a reason why the word \"godsend\" is synonymous with luck.",
				"{@b Churches, Clergy, Worship}",
				"There are no proper churches or temples dedicated to the Clover of Creation, but shrines to Mercuria can be found throughout Aventyr, especially in the wilderness and in and around dangerous ruins or catacombs. It is said that one faithful to Lady Luck who prays at a shrine will receive her blessing for the rest of the day (reroll natural 1s).",
				"{@b Holy Text}",
				"There are no holy texts proper for Mercuria as she is too flighty and chaotic to be tied to such things as the order and words of humanoidkind. That said, there have been moments of divine musical inspiration by a select few prodigal composers in Aventyr which brought about songs which, when performed by a maestro, bring luck to all whose ears are blessed with the miraculous melody (Advantage on all Rolls for the rest of the day). When these same songs are performed by lesser-known musicians, a similar effect occurs but only for a short while.",
