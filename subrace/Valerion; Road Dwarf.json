However, centuries of adaption to traveling the winding roads stretching across the lands has created a distinct subset of dwarf. Road dwarves, whether living as wandering mercantile clans or exiles banished from their homeland, use their natural charms and swift journeying to build their fortune and make a name for themselves.",
