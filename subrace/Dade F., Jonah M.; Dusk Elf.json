					"The ancestors of the drow subrace brought back to existence through the death of Lolth, the drow goddess of assassins, chaos, darkness, drow, evil and spiders and rise of Faen, elven god of change, retribution, and change. There aren't many dusk elves in existence, with most descending from chosen drow transformed by Faen or his champion, Saryn. Dusk elves are survivors, constantly looking foward and mingling with many around them. Dusk elves value adaptibility and social ability, constantly looking for more stimulation from their environment. Dusk elves tend to have skin in hues of dark blues and purples while the extremities, like fingers and ear tips, fade into lighter oranges, pinks, and whites, like the setting sun. Their hair tends to have gradients akin to the setting sun at dusk, but can also be entirely white, blond, ginger, light purple, or even pink. Their eyes can be any natural colors as well as purples, reds, pinks, and grays.",
