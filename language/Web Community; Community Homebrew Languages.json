This cant also has codewords for many common words to do with their work, and can be used - in the same way thieves' cant is used - to deliver veiled messages and communicate basic instructions. See p.96 of the Player's Handbook for more info on how this cant can be used between two speakers.",

This would raise to DC15 for understanding something slightly harder, like a rendez vous with condition attached (\"meet at the Cathedral and bring an axe\"), and DC20 for anything more complex. They are unable to write a coherent coded message."
