Cats are famous for their ability to land feet-first. A cat that falls more than a few feet will right itself in the air, landing on its feet and rarely suffering any harm, even after falling from great heights. Legend speaks of a wizard who tied two cats together, back-to-back, causing them to rapidly spin in the air to generate power for their rituals."

There are common breeds known for herding livestock, guarding against intruders, pulling carts and sleds, killing rats, tracking by scent, and various forms of hunting. They tend to be happiest when they can do the task they were bred for."

					"These crustaceans differ from crabs because their shelled bodies are elongated, defined by muscular tails and claws. Lobsters are scavengers, searching for food by walking along the ocean floor, and escaping from danger by using their powerful tails to propel them backwards with great speed.",
					"{@b {@i Long-Lived.}}  Unlike most animals, lobsters do not seem to grow weaker with age. They never stop growing through their lives, shedding their old shell as they outgrow it each year. In the deepest reaches of the ocean, there are rumored to be lobsters that have lived for centuries and grown to the size of horses.",
					"{@b {@i Coastal Foods.}}  As with crabs, many humanoid cultures eat lobsters, finding abundant meat in their claws and tails. Where lobsters are plentiful and easy to catch, they are considered a food suitable only for the poor and the upper classes disdain them. Canny coastal merchants, however, have learned to pass lobsters off as a delicacy in inland cities, commanding high prices from discerning gourmands.",
					"{@b {@i Aquatic Pets.}}  Merfolk and aquatic elves disdain to eat lobsters at all, instead raising them as pets. It is said that elf-raised lobster breeds are more affectionate and playful, while the merfolk's preferred breeds are aggressive hunters of aquatic pests. Both types are bred for more striking blue and yellow colors than their wild cousins. They are surprisingly appreciative of belly-rubs. Surface-dwellers may still be put off by their relatively quiet demeanors and lack of fur; their cuteness is undoubtedly in the eye of the beholder."

A threatened opossum will enter a state that is a remarkably convincing imitation of death. The opossum loses consciousness, goes stiff, and even produces a scent akin to that of a dead animal. Experienced hunters exploit this state, simply picking a stunned opossum up by its tail for later use. They return to consciousness on their own, no worse for wear, after about an hour. Younger, less experienced opossums may enter this state whenever something startles them.",

This gives them a reputation as dirty creatures, but they are quite fastidious in their own way. They are known for their distinctive habit of washing food in water before they eat it.",
					"Raccoons' \"masked\" appearance gives them a reputation as thieves, but what makes the reputation stick is their talent for stealing things. Raccoons are very clever, capable of solving complex problems and even passing the solutions on to other raccoons. This is frustrating to humanoids trying to keep the animals out of their garbage, but useful in an adventuring partner. In fact, many thieves and rogues find a like-minded companion in a raccoon.",
					"{@b {@i Raccoon Clans.}}  Raccoons living in the same area band together in small, temporary clans. They team up to defend their range against outsiders and predators, and to execute heists they couldn't pull off alone. No one's garbage is safe when raccoons join forces.",
					"{@b {@i Canine Rivalry.}}  Raccoons consider dogs their eternal foes. When a dog stands between raccoons and what they want, they go out of their way to vex and embarrass it.",
					"{@b {@i Natural Rebels.}}  Raccoons are strong-willed and independent. Humanoids who try to domesticate raccoons find they don't take orders, and resent attempts to teach them \"tricks.\" Those with raccoon companions find they have better luck viewing the raccoon as less of a pet, and more of a partner in crime."

The spirit then made enough arrows to fill a dozen quivers using materials from the forest.

Squirrels have a keen sense for where something has been buried, and a strong compulsion to dig it up again and see what it is. As a result, some treasure hunters adopt them as mascots.",

Skilled elven rangers often cultivate spy networks among squirrels in order to gather news of comings and goings in the forest."

They most often use their tails as traps, hanging them down from treetop perches and entangling any unwelcome trespassers. It is said that as a feluros' wisdom grows, so does the length of this tail.

They are just as likely to challenge a foe in a battle of wits as they are to hunt them. Any creature to best a feluros has earned its right into the guarded domain, and any creature that attempts to flee will be hunted mercilessly. In their time as guardians, a feluros occasionally finds a creature who they consider a superior, and are inclined to join them."

However, a truly attentive listener may be able to gain insight from the loftus' incisive questions.",

In fact, all loftus can exert control over the air around them. This magical breeze takes them wherever they like, and can even carry the loftus across planar boundaries. A loftus can use this control over wind in other ways as well, such as to move objects or protect itself."

					"Awakened mugs live to serve, a truth so literal that they wouldn't exist without it. Conceived by a wizard whose ingenuity was matched only by his laziness, animated mugs possess a spark of intelligence and autonomy that allow them to provide appropriate libations when needed, even without explicit instructions.",
					"Ironically, with that intelligence come some complications. Awakened mugs become restless when shut up in a cupboard or backpack, and tend to act out if not used regularly. They much prefer to wander freely, or wobble along behind their owner during a journey. Fortunately, they come when called\u2014or, indeed, when they expect their master to be thirsty, whether they've been called or not.",
					"{@b {@i Self-Filling.}}  The awakened mug can magically fill itself with various liquids when asked, or when the mug feels like it. The mug can bring its contents to a boil, nearly freeze it, or completely alter its flavor. Flavor alteration sounds like quite the cash cow for tavern owners, who all quickly learn they don't actually get to pick the flavors. Awakened mugs often develop strange, almost fey senses of humor. With masters who can appreciate such humor, a strong friendship quickly forms.",
					"{@b {@i Mixological Memory.}}  Perhaps the most useful ability of the animated mug is its memory. The mug can recall any drink that has ever been poured into it, and recreate that drink when it refills itself. The mug can't recreate the supernatural elements of magic potions\u2014that would truly be nonsense. But, it can fix you a Cosmopolitan the way you had it that one time, while you were hiding from pit fiends in a cave in the lower planes, and that might be just as impressive.",
					"{@b {@i Feud.}}  Awakened mugs have an entirely irrational hostility toward other animated objects. They will take any opportunity to spill their contents on rugs of smothering, animated suits of armor, and any other objects they perceive as rivals. Their complete lack of actual combat ability makes their aggressive endeavors quite the slapstick show for bar patrons."

Luckily for the most vain of adventurers, Ladro the Avaricious has decided to put the instructions and ingredients for this ritual on the market: for more than a pretty copper, naturally. Each fetchen is entirely unique, and entirely tied to its creator's existence.",
					"{@b {@i Tethered by Fate.}}  A fetchen's existence is no more than an extension of its creator. It cannot act or think without some semblance of direction, and dies the instant its master is slain. As a part of the ritual, detailed below, the very life force of its maker is a vital ingredient.",
					"{@b {@i Incomplete Design.}}  To the dismay of some adventurers, the fetchen can't replicate its creator's face, and its visage is devoid of features. It is unable to communicate using anything more than gestures, and lacks complete intelligence. A number of refunds have been attempted after rather embarrassing actions were performed by a fetchen.",
					"{@b {@i Ladro's Homunkit.}}  The instructions for creating a fetchen are detailed extensively in the \"kit\" produced by Ladro. 1 cubic foot of clay-like matter, provided by the kit, must be infused with the blood of a humanoid with at least 10 hit points. The process of creating the fetchen reduces the creator's hit point maximum by 1 hit die, and the fetchen gains health equal to the maximum amount that die can roll (or 4 hit points, whichever is higher). This health is returned to its creator if the fetchen is killed.",
					"The material must then be placed into a waterskin, a clay or leather egg, or a glass container. After two weeks, the fetchen grows to the size of the chamber (ranging from \u2014 foot to 2 feet tall). It then emerges from the egg, wearing clothing identical to the clothing its master wore when creating it. If the clothing grants the creator an AC bonus, the fetchen also gains that bonus (up to +4). Their statistics are also based on their creator, gaining the following ability scores, assigned from highest to lowest, in the same order as their creator's ability scores ranked from highest to lowest: 14, 12, 10, 10, 8, 6.",
					"The fetchen's speed equals half of their creator's speed, and they gain any senses their creator currently has. The homunkit also provides an assortment of tiny weapons, each one capable of dealing 1d4 damage: a shortsword, a handaxe, a warhammer, and a shortbow (with a range of 10/25 feet)."

Following this path, however, gradually drives goodness out of the bard's soul as they come to embrace the thisschord's songs. When they have truly mastered the music of malice, an infernal lyre appears for them, fashioned in the depths of the abyss, and a new thisschord is born."

Wizards' parasites are well versed in avoiding their host's notice. As they consume knowledge from a host, they are careful to eat any memory the host has of finding the parasite. Long-term hosts of the creature become increasingly absent-minded, ironically causing the parasites to lose interest in them. Wizards' parasites cannot always rely on this ability, though, which leads them to carve out a nice hiding spot before siphoning thoughts. They swell with the knowledge they consume, however, and a well-fed wizard's parasite may become conspicuous.",

Hosts who welcome the parasite may even find a symbiotic relationship, gaining the remnants of devoured thoughts and memories during times of need.",
					"Immortal Reservoirs? No one is certain how long a wizard's parasite can live, if such unnatural creatures can even be said to have a lifespan. Some wizards have preserved parasites that they claim have survived for millennia, and which they believe contain fragments of knowledge from sages lost to history. No reliable method has yet been found to extract information from the creature's swollen gut, however.",
					"Spawn of the Deceiver? A minority of sages believe that these parasites were created by an ancient god of secrets and lies, in order to destroy knowledge and confound the studious. If that were the case, the parasites' creator must truly be pleased with the work they have done."

					"On certain remote islands, a subspecies of owlbear has gradually shrunk to the size of halflings. Capturing them for the pet trade was one of the largest mistakes poachers have made, as they've spread across domains as an oddly invasive predator. Like the larger owlbears that terrorize larger forests, these creatures have the heads of owls and the bodies of bears, though in this case the owl's head retains more familiar proportions. Their grumpy dispositions are more severe than those of either owls or bears.",
					"{@b {@i Social Sleuths.}}  Pygmy owlbears tolerate each other better than their full-sized cousins. They often live and hunt in groups of six to twelve, barreling through the brush after prey like children chasing a ball. Because they are social, a miniature owlbear raised from a chick can imprint on a humanoid and accept them as part of their sleuth. Pound-for-pound, they can still be every bit as ill-tempered as regular owlbears, but with persistence and some healing magic one can discover that pygmy owlbears are quite cuddly.",
					"{@b {@i Naive, but Bold.}}  Living on islands that have not heard humanoid footfalls for ages, pygmy owlbears' understanding of humanoids lacks a developed instinct. They are used to being the largest animals in their environment, and anything larger than themselves is seen either as a spectacle or a challenge. However, facing a full armada of these small creatures can prove to be an unexpected danger."

					"A feared hunter of remote savannas, these tatzelwurms are smaller and swifter than their mountain-dwelling cousins. Taking features from both hunting snakes and cheetahs, they can run down and launch themselves at almost any prey. They prefer to kill quickly with a single bite, rarely hunting game that might notice them or fight back. Most frighteningly, savanna tatzelwurms are nearly silent, even when moving at full speed. Their cry, when they make a sound, is a piercing hiss.",
					"{@b {@i Transient Attachments.}}  Savanna tatzelwurms are territorial, annually coming together to mate and raise young before separating again. In their solitary periods they can form connections with members of other species who they do not consider threats. It is uncommon for savanna tatzelwurms to hunt humanoids, and some may even befriend one if the promise of consistent prey is made. Expert hunters may spend years watching a tatzelwurm, learning from a master of its craft, and some barbarian tribes hold up savanna tatzelwurms as their totem. Young hunters may prove themselves by seeking out a tatzelwurm and surviving the encounter.",
					"{@b {@i Threads of History.}}  Many scholars have entertained possible ways that these creatures came to be. The most common assumption ties them to crafty wizards that grafted animals together, forming dangerous hunters on a whim. Others have examined their scale formation and shedding, noting exceptional similarities between tatzelwurms and dragons. This connection is reinforced by the authority these creatures have over their homes, and the fear they incite in the hearts of those that live near them."

Even so, tarnishers enjoy stockpiling as much iron as they can to eat later. A tarnisher den may be piled with scrap that can feed its inhabitants for years. No matter how much they have in reserve, however, tarnishers never stop gathering more.",

Smaller, friendlier, and less ravenous than their cousins, these creatures have an easier time coexisting with humanoids. Some people even find them charming, and enjoy a tarnisher's enthusiasm for a snack of scrap metal. Tarnishers raised from hatchlings can be kept as pets, and even feral ones are friendly to anyone who feeds them. With a bag of ball bearings, one can pass a pleasant afternoon in a back alley feeding the neighborhood tarnishers."

Such severed appendages readily reattach to their owner, or to any other gummybear ooze they come in contact with. Those who keep gummybear oozes around, for whatever reason, sometimes take advantage of this quality by switching the heads or limbs of different specimens, creating a \"customized\" ooze to follow them on adventures.",

Though most gummybear oozes are about 2 feet high, they can aggregate to a truly terrifying scale. Although merging gummybear oozes slowly redistribute themselves into a single bear-shape, a newly-merged ooze can retain features from its smaller members, such as multiple heads or a proliferation of arms."

					"The bloom crawler is an unusual plant that bears an uncanny resemblance to a toad. They are strong and hardy creatures that often choose to ignore fights they're capable of winning. Left to itself, a bloom crawler uses its power of locomotion to follow the sun, always staying where the light is most direct. They trample meandering trails through their forests, and unwary travelers may find themselves following a bloom crawler in circles, mistakenly assuming they've found a game trail. ",
					"{@b {@i Diverse Diet.}}  Bloom crawlers get nearly all of their energy from sunlight, but as they follow the sun they also graze indiscriminately, swallowing grass and soil alike. They use viney tendrils to smack bugs out of the air around them, devouring anything that sticks to the vines. Oddly, they can't digest the seeds of fruit or other vegetation, and instead carry them alongside its own seeds.",
					"{@b {@i Vegetative Defenses.}}  Being energetic piles of vegetation, bloom crawlers sometimes must defend themselves against creatures that would nibble on them. Instead of using the force of its full body, or its toothy maw, a bloom crawler uses its vine tendrils to rapidly whip enemies. It can also spit its seeds with great force, which is useful in propagating its species but also serves as a weapon that dissuades most threats.",
					"{@b {@i Animal Helpers.}}  Although they can fend off most large herbivores, bloom crawlers often find themselves overwhelmed by insects they simply can't manage. Bloom crawlers encourage birds to visit their leaves to help eat the bugs that vex them, creating a partnership that benefits both. More intelligent creatures have learned to take advantage of this need, learning that the bloom crawler will follow any creature that helps it clean its leaves. Some communities of wood elves have used this trick to gather bloom crawlers into semi-domesticated herds."

They feed primarily on small animals such as birds, but they will try to eat larger prey such as deer or even humanoids. The presence of a partially-devoured carcass underneath an innocuous-looking vine is a clear warning.",

When it remains motionless, a vine-snake is all but indistinguishable from an inanimate plant. Any creature close enough to examine it closely has likely missed its chance to escape.",
					"{@b {@i Fanged Tendrils.}}  Like any vine, a vine-snake grows a number of tendrils to wrap around nearby objects. Unlike most vines, the vine-snake's tendrils each end with a snake's head. When excited, the vine's tendrils can dart out as quickly as any snake. The snake heads' many eyes, ears, and noses make the vine snake surprisingly perceptive. They almost always detect an approaching creature in time to still themselves and resume their disguise.",
					"{@b {@i Cumbersome Slithering.}}  The saving grace of a vine-snake, for those hoping to escape one, is that they have trouble disengaging from a hiding place, much less crawling quickly over the ground. They make up for this in most cases with their fast-acting poison, which renders the chase moot."

Like your typical domestic pet, the hand axe will always return to its master and protect them to the bitter end. Best of all, it already knows how to play dead."

A renine is the spirit of an exceptionally loyal creature that was separated from its master and died before finding them again. The unfinished search binds the renine to the realm of the living, forever tied to its master. A renine appears as a ghostly image of the creature it was in life, albeit translucent and often floating above the ground. If obstructed in its search, the renine can fight with the ferocity and determination of a living creature. More often, though, renines are incorporeal and elusive, perceptible only by the sound of a distant whimper.",

If a renine does not know where to look for its missing master, it may follow someone who reminds it of its master. Such pairings are temporary, however, and the renine never gives up its search.",
					"When a renine finds its master alive, it tries to rejoin them and accompany them once again. A welcomed renine will never spend even a moment away from its old friend, persisting until its master's final breath. Once that happens, the renine then passes to the next world along with the master's spirit. If the master is dead when the renine finds them, the renine instead becomes an eternal guardian of their resting place.",
					"{@b {@i Rejection.}}  The most horrible fate for a renine is to find its old master and be turned away. When this happens, the renines spirit completely changes to one of fear, hatred, and retribution. First, it will attack its old master and any of their allies or companions. Thereafter it becomes a scourge to the old master's kind, wandering the night and assaulting the living with eternal cries, forever mourning its rejection."
