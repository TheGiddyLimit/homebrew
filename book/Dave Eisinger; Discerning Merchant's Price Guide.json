								"The Discerning Merchant's Price Guide is a tool primarily for Dungeon Masters, although players may find it useful as well, particularly in magic-heavy campaigns. It is an organizational tool for magic items in D&D Fifth Edition (but does not include artifacts, sentient items, or items that only differ in flavor). It groups magic items together into tables: melee weapons, armor, staffs, rings, and so on, similarly to how items were laid out in 3.5e. This should help DMs know exactly where to look and what their options are for handing out a given item.",

								"How much a magic item merchant charges for their wares generally depends on their experience and their location. Savvy merchants will better know how to buy low and sell high, and also know exactly how competitive they have to be given their surrounding market.",
								"Most PCs will inevitably wish to barter with merchants for a better deal, whether buying or selling items. Refer to the Merchant Shrewdness tables on the previous page for determining the DC for any skill checks PCs make when trying to get a better deal.",
								"For a {@b successful skill check}, move the merchant's prices down by one shrewdness level\u2014the merchant's selling prices will drop, and their buying prices will rise. For example, suppose the merchant in question is an average purveyor of magic goods in a large city, and so are selling goods at base price and buying them at 80% of base price. A successful skill check would shift them to selling goods at 95% of base price, and buying them at 90% of base price. If a successful skill check would push the price beyond the bounds of the table\u2014for example, by receiving a discount from an already naïve merchant\u2014just add or subtract an additional 10% as appropriate.",
								"Most of the time, {@b failing a check} simply means no benefit is gained. However, perhaps informed by the merchant's mood, you may wish to apply a penalty for skill checks that fail by 5 or more\u2014perhaps the merchant charges them prices from the next category of shrewdness up, or in extreme cases might even refuse to do further business with them (although this last should probably be reserved for threats of violence or repeat offenses).",
								"Lastly... {@b if all this sounds way too complicated}, don't bother with any of it. Just use the Quick Price Modifiers table on page 3, or ignore math entirely and make it up on the fly. Remember that all these tables are here to be helpful, so just ignore whatever isn't actually helping you run a better game.",

Customers primarily visit by appointment, unless they don't mind the 10-minute wait it takes for a runner to obtain permission for surprise visitors.",

She rambles from rumor to rumor without pause, asking if the visitors have heard of the cow named Annabetsy that killed a green dragon, or that Cade Bigheart has been poisoning his ale and that's why Aiolos Vassos is sick, or that Eira Ekela is absolutely a ghoul and not a dwarf and that she {@i eats people}. Scandalous.",

More generally, Azza is very friendly probably {@b too friendly}. When telling customers about her wares, {@b she frequently refers to a rival merchant}, a traveling gnome named Farrick Nucklestabble who is clearly her nemesis. Sure, he always has better stock, but good luck finding him.",

She is of {@b Average} shrewdness, but her good mood makes her a bit more willing to bargain, so any relevant skill checks against her are made at {@b DC 13}. She is additionally on the lookout for {@b new income opportunities}, since business can sometimes be slow here if the PCs have something applicable, bartering is only against DC 8.",
