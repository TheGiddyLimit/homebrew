The work inside is a handwritten manuscript, filled with footnotes, revisions, and corrections. The book contains a history of all significant events for the last two hundred years\u2014and this history can be edited. A careless scratch can erase the founding of a kingdom and a quick note can change the outcome of a war. Revising history creates a new, branching timeline in which that change applies.",
				"The ripple effect of unintended consequences is significant, and changes always come with severe, unwelcome consequences: the early death of an evil king creates a power vacuum that allows a new tyrant to rise; preventing a plague leads to overpopulation and famine.",
				"If you make a revision in the timeline using this book, you remember the original timeline and the change you've made, but struggle to separate the two. Your Intelligence score is permanently reduced by 2 and can't be restored by any means.",

						"{@link We're back.|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOkSvLqkafU} Thanks to your support, {@i ARCADIA} 4 is in your hands, and we're working on the magazine indefinitely. I truly mean it when I say that we wouldn't be here without you. So on behalf of all of us at MCDM, thank you!",
						"You're probably wondering, \"What does the future hold for {@i ARCADIA}?\" After {@loader ARCADIA 3|book/MCDM Productions; Arcadia Issue 3.json} was published, we launched a survey on Patreon about {@i ARCADIA} and MCDM in general and learned a lot of information. Over 2,500 people responded. Thanks again.",
						"Much of what you told us simply confirmed what we knew to be true: many of you are Game Masters looking for high-utility articles that will help you create encounters, adventures, and worlds. I think what did surprise us was that more than 90% of you are GMs, and almost 70% of you are forever GMs, the kind of person who never takes on the role of a player character (by choice or by circumstance). We had no idea that the numbers were that high.",
						"One of the other numbers that initially took us by surprise was the types of {@i ARCADIA} articles that readers find most useful. New creatures outpaced every other option, followed by magic items, encounters, locations, and spells in that order. Given how many GMs read {@i ARCADIA}, it was incredible to me that adventures didn't crack the top 5. But when I looked at what did make the most popular list, I realized why. Our GMs prefer to build their own worlds and create unique stories with the players. You want the building blocks to make adventures and don't always want a near-complete story handed to you.",
						"The more we break down the building blocks, the more useful our readers find the article. Drop-in encounters, which build adventures, aren't as popular as new creatures, which are used to build encounters. The more basic the piece of material, we found, the easier it is for you to use in your campaigns.",
						"So what changes are in store for {@i ARCADIA} moving forward? For the next several issues, it may not seem like a lot. For one thing, articles for many of near-future issues were commissioned before we conducted the survey, in order to bring you content in a timely manner. We also want to keep including articles with new subclasses, ancestries, and other player character options because we hope to grow and diversify {@i ARCADIA's} audience.",
						"However, within articles that provide player options, you'll also find useful tools for the GM. Remember the \"Titan Heart\" article by {@link Gabe Hicks|https://twitter.com/GabeJamesGames} in {@loader ARCADIA 1|book/MCDM Productions; Arcadia Issue 1.json}? It included a sorcerer subclass, new spells, an NPC stat block, and a retainer. More like that is coming your way.",
						"We also won't stop publishing adventures any time soon, but there won't be one in every issue of {@i ARCADIA} like there was for issues 1, 2, and 3. We're going to mix it up by providing encounters, creatures, and the other building blocks of adventures. That's why this issue features a new location with creatures and magic items in {@link Cat Evans's|https://twitter.com/perpetualgloom} \"The Chained Library,\" even more creatures and magic items in {@link Willy Abeel's|https://twitter.com/TheWillyboo} article that serves as a sequel to his mounted combat piece in {@loader ARCADIA 1|book/MCDM Productions; Arcadia Issue 1.json}, and a bunch of drop in encounters from {@link Derek Ruiz|https://twitter.com/ElvenTower}. When we have adventures in the future, they'll be easy to strip for parts or present a unique concept, like rules and an adventure for level-0 characters or a module meant for a party of goblin heroes!",

The library's agents, who go out into the world to acquire new books, can also serve as adversaries looking for a book the characters possess or are seeking. Especially bold (or reckless) characters might try to steal a powerful book from the library. This article presents the library's lore, plot hooks, stat blocks, and some of the magic items kept within its vaults.",
						"The Chained Library is a great fortress built into the black rock cliffs far from civilization. Spellbooks of liches and necromancers and ancient tomes of infernal secrets line the library's prison-shelves, guarded by blind celestials.",
						"The library predates every known kingdom and even some of the younger gods. There are as many stories about its origin as there are sages to tell them. The Chained Library's own version, sealed in a marble vault in the deepest depths of the archive, attributes its founding to Archmage Valistus. It is written that Valistus' apprentice, Ravelin, gave himself over to the study of dark magic. Valistus intervened, sealing away his apprentice's spellbooks and research, along with all the tomes and scrolls he used to guide his studies. Valistus summoned and bound celestial creatures of unwavering morals to guard them. In time, other mages and scholars presented Valistus with dangerous texts that could damn the world.",
						"Now, the Chained Library sends out agents to find and claim more dangerous books. The library's judgement is strict and their agents persistent: once the librarians determine that a book must be taken into their secure storage, they work tirelessly to obtain it, regardless of how it's being used; a book of necromancy used to cure a plague is still an evil book, and must be shut away. Occasionally a visitor who proves their wisdom and moral character might be allowed to peruse a tome or two, under supervision, but knowledge taken into the library is effectively lost forever. However, the library never destroys a text: knowledge is sacred, and any information might serve a purpose in the future.",

A creature who fails the save must also roll one Hit Die. Its hit point maximum is permanently reduced by the amount on the die, and its Hit Dice are permanently reduced by one. The rot spreads daily, spreading up the arms, over the body, and eventually up to the creature's face. The thief must repeat the save at dawn each day, whether they succeed or fail. The {@spell greater restoration} spell restores the creature's hit point maximum and total number of Hit Dice, but the thief must keep making saving throws each day until they return the book to its correct place in the library.
