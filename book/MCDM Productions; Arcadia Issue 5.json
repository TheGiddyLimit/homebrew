						"The Circle of the Gilded's rules about finding and embedding gems into your body are intentionally worded so that a druid with this subclass doesn't need to spend time finding and incorporating the gems they want to use into their body. The rules take pressure off the GM to provide specific gems so that a player can use their character's features. A druid also doesn't need to buy these gems. This is similar to the way a wizard adds two spells to their spellbook whenever they gain a level for free, or how a ranger meets an animal companion after entering a specific subclass. Those two spells cost no time or money, and the ranger pays nothing and spends no time on the initial recruitment of their beast friend. The same goes for the druid. You might decide your druid slowly incorporates their gems into their body overtime, performs a ritual while resting, or undergoes a surgical procedure. These gems might be family heirlooms you inherit, stones grown in a magic garden, or treasures you found during downtime between adventures. Work with your GM to determine the narrative. Similarly, swapping out one gem for another doesn't require the GM to reward the druid with the new stone they want to use."

While magic exists to detect scrying\u2014and even to prevent it in the first place\u2014the scryed-upon ultimately has few options. Detecting a scrying sensor has little value; you do not learn who is watching you or why, only that you are not alone.",
				"Hence I found this spell of particular interest. While fairly vindictive, it provides a nimble mage with the option to strike down a scrying sensor if they can see it. Breaking the connection is extremely disorientating for your unwelcome observer, and makes for rather effective deterrence. Furthermore, even though this spell was first designed to sever magical connections, it severs a creature's synapses pretty well too, making it a dangerous ace to keep up your sleeve."

				"Born to wealthy nobles who owned several emerald mines, there was never a moment in his upbringing where he felt lack or need. He bragged about how he walked around with uncut gems in his pockets in his days at the academy. When he came of age and his parents decided to teach him how to manage the mines, he was initially horrified. They exploited their miners for little pay and forced them to work in dangerous conditions under strict contracts that prevented departure. Everything suddenly clicked into place for Garin. As it dawned on him that this exploitation was the reason for his wealth...he embraced it.",
				"But unlike his parents, whose zeal for hard capital was secular, Garin looked at his inheritance and saw it as his divine duty to {@deity Pta'u|Unknown|Ar5} to expand, grow, and consume. He would never be satisfied. He convinced his workers that their labor in his service was a path to the divine. Their hard work, sweat, and tears would lead to countless rewards in the next life... and countless rewards in this life for Garin.",
				"A prosperity preacher of the highest order, Garin keeps a close counsel of powerful, mercenary-minded adventurers and commands a loyal following of brainwashed cult-like laborers who literally die to hand him a freshly mined gem. Garin can be found most often managing his various enterprises, but as of late he has felt the itch of adventure and has taken to traveling in search of more resources (both material and humanoid) to exploit.",
				"Garin never faces down an enemy without a well-prepared battlefield or plenty of minions. His primary strategy is to keep as much cannon fodder between him and his foes while simultaneously bolstering his legions and himself. He makes good use of his Prophet Motive feature to keep buffs on his allies and himself while using spells like {@spell guardian of faith} and {@spell spirit guardians} to control the battlefield to his liking. He is a coward at heart and will leave his minions to die if he sees the tides turning against him."

						"I think about diamonds a lot\u2014fantasy diamonds. In the real world, these engagement stones are worth a lot of cash, but in fifth edition, these rocks bring people back from the dead. I want to create a world where diamonds are mined to scarcity and hoarded by the wealthy. Adventurers plan and execute heists to steal the gems, maybe to help the oppressed or to sell on the black market, and eventually make an enemy of the diamond-mongering aristocracy, secretly led by a corrupt ancient gold dragon! Yes, the nobles have soldiers, diamond golems, and more to battle the heroes, but they also have enough wealth that they might simply be able to pay those greedy adventurers off. Will the characters sell out?",
						"I think about this campaign idea because it honestly seems to me the way things would go in a world where diamonds are the key to resurrection (cynical as that worldview may be). It is human nature to cheat death at all costs. By drawing on that universal truth, we can create stories for our games that feel authentic and grounded in reality, even though we all know that diamonds can't actually revive the dead. To make an entire world, I took a single element of the game, and a small one\u2014a spell component, and developed it further than the existing rule. I asked, \"What happens if diamonds are a key part of performing miracles?\"",
						"In a high fantasy game with complex systems, there are thousands of questions that lead to incredible stories if you try to answer them with sincerity. If bards, clerics, druids, paladins, and rangers can all cast {@spell lesser restoration}, how could disease ever be a problem? Dragons are super powerful and love treasure, so why wouldn't they get out of their caves more often and plunder, plunder, plunder? If wizardry can be taught, do (possibly predatory) banks loan money to farmers so their kids can go to wizard college?",
						"There are no wrong answers to these questions, but the most authentic responses often lead to the most interesting and relatable stories and creations. Maybe your next campaign world has magic-resistant diseases, active bandit dragons, and too many wizards and not enough farmers! Sounds like a fun place to play.",
						"The three articles in this issue of {@i ARCADIA} take some big questions and follow them to interesting and authentic conclusions. Leon Barillaro mused, \"If most curses can be easily removed by a 3rd-level spell, then eventually someone would make curses built to last. How do those work?\" Carlos Cisco thought, \"If some adventurers are only in it for the gold, then greed is one of their core values. How might that theme express itself in some subclasses?\" And finally, Sam Mannell asked, \"Since many wizards can travel the planes, what other spells might they see or be inspired to create?\" Those simple thoughts brought you articles filled with new curses, subclasses, monsters, and spells.",
						"I encourage you to do the same in your games. We have good fun making memes or laughing with friends about what might happen if you get some demon ichor in an open wound...but what WOULD happen? The questions may seem silly at times, but the assumptions can unlock awesome new stories.",

But before he has the chance to meet the charming Belle, a 5th-level cleric comes along and offers Beast a chance to return to normalcy\u2014for a small fee, of course. Beast goes back to womanizing the very next day. He can afford it.",
						"In fifth edition, the {@spell remove curse} spell sucks away the delicious narrative potential that stories have been taking advantage of since the invention of stories.

But for many worshippers, avarice often comes from misinterpretation of the texts or tennents. When prosperity preachers finally realize what they've wrought, they're far too comfortable with or have fully extolled greed as virtue.",
								"Avarice commonly manifests in merchants or those that worship gods of trade, but it is hardly bound to commerce. Priests of the dead may insist on steep funeral costs, lest the fallen linger in this realm. A devout sailor may grip the oceans in terror, becoming a dread pirate lord upon discovering the riches gleaned off the backs of others\u2014but their crew, their family, is the most well fed and paid on the high seas. A priest dedicated to a god of knowledge may hoard troves of texts until they pass, leaving a legendary library in their wake. There are even stories throughout the planes of a \"Church of Greed\"\u2014a temple that worships no god in its pursuit of the divine, but rather the very concept of avarice itself.",
								"Not every cleric of avarice is \"evil,\" or even \"not very nice.\" Voracity can lead to ambition, which, with the right tempering, can become a form of highly directed altruism. Imagine the gnome friar who bestows daily blessings of fortune to the local miners, who in turn bring a small tithe at the end of the profitable day. Or the dwarven forge cleric who offers to consult priests of plenty in fine gem work in a mutually profitable relationship. Even the odd dungeon-crashing adventurer can transform their passion for stray animal adoption into a fully funded shelter for wayward monsters.",

After a life of opulence, he should want for nothing, yet all he does is want. His path of avarice started early and only deepened.",
								"Born to wealthy nobles who owned several emerald mines, there was never a moment in his upbringing where he felt lack or need. He bragged about how he walked around with uncut gems in his pockets in his days at the academy. When he came of age and his parents decided to teach him how to manage the mines, he was initially horrified. They exploited their miners for little pay and forced them to work in dangerous conditions under strict contracts that prevented departure. Everything suddenly clicked into place for Garin. As it dawned on him that this exploitation was the reason for his wealth...he embraced it.",
								"But unlike his parents, whose zeal for hard capital was secular, Garin looked at his inheritance and saw it as his divine duty to {@deity Pta'u|Unknown|Ar5} to expand, grow, and consume. He would never be satisfied. He convinced his workers that their labor in his service was a path to the divine. Their hard work, sweat, and tears would lead to countless rewards in the next life... and countless rewards in this life for Garin.",
								"A prosperity preacher of the highest order, Garin keeps a close counsel of powerful, mercenary-minded adventurers and commands a loyal following of brainwashed cult-like laborers who literally die to hand him a freshly mined gem. Garin can be found most often managing his various enterprises, but as of late he has felt the itch of adventure and has taken to traveling in search of more resources (both material and humanoid) to exploit.",
								"Garin never faces down an enemy without a well-prepared battlefield or plenty of minions. His primary strategy is to keep as much cannon fodder between him and his foes while simultaneously bolstering his legions and himself. He makes good use of his Prophet Motive feature to keep buffs on his allies and himself while using spells like {@spell guardian of faith} and {@spell spirit guardians} to control the battlefield to his liking. He is a coward at heart and will leave his minions to die if he sees the tides turning against him.",

								"There is nothing quite like the neckprickling sensation of a {@spell scrying} sensor watching over you. While magic exists to detect scrying\u2014and even to prevent it in the first place\u2014the scryed-upon ultimately has few options. Detecting a scrying sensor has little value; you do not learn who is watching you or why, only that you are not alone.",
								"Hence I found this spell of particular interest. While fairly vindictive, it provides a nimble mage with the option to strike down a scrying sensor if they can see it. Breaking the connection is extremely disorientating for your unwelcome observer, and makes for rather effective deterrence. Furthermore, even though this spell was first designed to sever magical connections, it severs a creature's synapses pretty well too, making it a dangerous ace to keep up your sleeve.",
