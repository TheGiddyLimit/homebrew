The oldest and wisest hags, grandmothers, play this deception so well that they inspire awe in their local communities and aspiring warlocks beg for their patronage. Some sorcerers are born from a hag bloodline and struggle to find acceptance from communities that fear their \"grannies.\" Bards tell stories of wicked witches in the woods, terrifying children and adults alike.",

								"The wise woman in the woods with a gleam of mischief in her eye. The ancient crone who roams the streets, talking to alleycats. The kindly widow with the frightening smile. Hags embody humanity's fears of manipulation, getting lost, and, worst of all, growing old. Solitary and crafty, hags typically keep only animal familiars as companions. On occasion, however, hags come together in groups of three or more to form covens, greatly increasing their power and spellcasting ability. As rife with disagreement as they are affection, hags in a coven constantly vie for control over each other.",
								"All hags share a few key commonalities, regardless of their variety. Most come from the Feywild and possess the faerie fixation with deals. Hags always twist the odds of these pacts in their favor. Rare is the hag without a grand plan, and rarer still is one that resists the natural temptation to prey upon human nature, bending mortals' worst impulses for the hag's amusement. Green hags particularly love to toy with mortal emotions. Night hags are partial to terrifying mortals to death, and sea hags relish destruction in all forms.",
								"The subclasses introduced in this article were developed around the legend of the hag, though any fairy-tale trickster could be used in their place. Perhaps a bard is inspired by the Big Bad Wolf, maybe a warlock seeks out Reynard the Fox, or perchance a sorcerer is descended from dreaded Queen Mab. The hag's legend looms large, but the world of faerie is vast and rife with tales to explore."

								"You can use any sharp blade to butcher a creature for spell component parts, but your best chance of getting an aboleth eye out of a socket in one piece is to use a harvesting kit. At the GM's discretion, whenever an ancestry, background, class, or feat allows you to gain proficiency with a set of tools, you can choose a harvesting kit instead of the other tool options.",
								"A harvesting kit contains ten vials, two tweezers, three harvesting knives (small, medium and large), and pieces of burlap fabric. The kit costs 20 gp. When you harvest components from a creature's remains with a harvesting kit, make a Dexterity check, adding your proficiency bonus if you are proficient with the kit. You also can harvest components from monsters without a harvesting kit using any sharpened blade, but checks to do so are made with disadvantage.",
								"The difficulty of removing a component depends on the monster's type and the component you're harvesting, as shown on the tables later in this article. You make one check to harvest all of one type of component a creature has to offer. For example, you only need to make one successful DC 17 Dexterity check with your harvesting kit to harvest all three eyes from an aboleth. Alternatively, at the GM's discretion, checks can be made for every component.",
								"The time it takes to harvest a component is based on the check's DC, as shown on the Harvesting Time table below.",
								"On a successful harvesting check, you obtain the desired component. On a failed check, you can repeat the check with disadvantage as many times as you wish. However, if you fail a check by 5 or more, the part is destroyed.",
								"Each creature has a specific number of usable components that you can harvest. For instance, planetars have more than thirty feathers in their wings, but only thirty that are of the right size and quality to be used as components. Finding and identifying these feathers is part of the harvesting process.",

								"Locals are accustomed to Emerald's disguise, believing it's all play to enhance the mystique of her magical shop and draw in customers. With newcomers, Emerald leans into the mystical with a low sultry voice, dramatic hand gestures casting the {@spell minor illusion} cantrip, and mysterious riddles or rhymes that leave customers intrigued until she laughs, smiles warmly, and greets them with open arms.",
								"The truth is that the makeup is an essential part of leading the Magia Hand. The current Emerald is not the first Emerald to run the guild. The first Emerald was appointed roughly two hundred years ago. The current Emerald is the ninth woman to lead. She has completely earned the trust and respect of the Guides.",
								"The identity of the leader is a secret from all but the Guides, who choose a new Emerald from the membership when the leader retires. It is always a human woman with dark hair, and the magical makeup is gifted to her.",
								"The special makeup comes from centuries of tradition and arcana in its creation, similar to a family recipe passed down through the generations. Each Emerald is trained by the previous Emerald on how to create and apply it. The makeup can't be dispelled, it's waterproof, and only Emerald can apply or remove it. Her old identity is completely erased from record, with all agreeing to forget her old life, and she becomes the new owner of the Exchange.",
								"The current Emerald entered the Magia Hand at 10 years old, an orphan recruited as an extraordinarily skilled cutpurse on the streets. It was the previous Emerald who caught her hand in her pocket and brought her into the organization. While the current Emerald loved the familial relationship that she formed with the other members of the Magia Hand, she wants to get away as far as possible from her time living unclean and hungry on the street. That goal drives her ambition and avarice.",

Her natural charm gave her an edge in adopting the Emerald name and persona. She's an extrovert who truly loves being the center of attention. Quick to smile and an outrageous flirt, Emerald enjoys a good joke and loves to make a pun whenever possible.",
										"Underneath her charm, Emerald is ruthless. She shares her true name with no one and ensured that no record in the Magia Hand documents who she was. She puts her own interests\u2014wealth and a love of expensive food and drink\u2014above all others. While she has never killed anyone, she wouldn't hesitate if there was no alternative.",
										"Emerald is an expert thief, though if asked she reacts with shock and deflects and denies the accusation. She revels in the risk of breaking into well-guarded locations and stealing treasures without leaving a trace. She lends her skills to Magia Hand expeditions if the payoff is good enough. When the guild is stretched thin or in need of extra hands, she hires adventurers.",

If you want to use Emerald as a villain, once the players have undertaken two quests for her or they find out secret information about her or the Magia Hand, use the \"Green With Envy\" adventure hook to make Emerald the characters' enemy."

The dungeon is a ruined lizardfolk city, one unexpectedly far more advanced in magic than recorded in history. The characters must find or make an entrance in the tavern basement and retrieve the item. The client, which Emerald never reveals, is the Magia Hand.
