						"We make a lot of monsters at MCDM. New monsters have appeared in the pages of {@i ARCADIA}, as well as in {@loader Strongholds & Followers|collection/MCDM Productions; Strongholds and Followers.json} and the recently-released {@loader Kingdoms & Warfare|book/MCDM Productions; Kingdoms & Warfare.json}. We also make miniatures of all kinds of creatures, from {@link Trudy the ruby wyrmling|https://shop.mcdmproductions.com/collections/miniatures/products/ruby-wyrmling-mini} to {@link Relg, the Lord in Corpulect|https://shop.mcdmproductions.com/collections/miniatures/products/relg-mini}. Our upcoming projects are brimming with fantastical creatures, and lately we've been spending even more time thinking about fantasy creatures great and small. First up is {@i The Beastmaster and Companions}, which includes new rules for player character pets and a class, the beastmaster, that adventures with one of these faithful companions. We're also working on our next big hardcover: a book of creatures that won't just supplement the core monster book, but can also replace it.",
						"Why do we want to create these fantastic creatures? The obvious answer is that they're core to a game that is built around fighting monsters. But if we dig just a little deeper, we're forced to ask why we love a game that revolves around imaginary critters.",
						"First of all, monsters inspire us to tell stories. They do things no creature in the real world can, and they have fascinating lore\u2014whether they originate from centuries of folklore and myth or they're brand-new creations. Such beings make memorable allies and enemies. The mere existence of dragons, unicorns, and xorns makes us ask, \"What else is out there?\"",
						"I think the first mechanical piece of the game that many GMs homebrew is a monster, because they want to add a creature to their story that doesn't exist anywhere else. It may just be a kobold with 100 more hit points than usual or an ogre with a tarrasque's Reflective Carapace trait, but that monster becomes unique. The GM and players will remember the encounter with the creature that was theirs alone for years to come.",
						"Another question fantastic beasts make us ask is, \"If these things about a monster are true, what else is true about this creature? What effects does the existence of this creature have on the world?\" For instance, a GM might know that metallic dragons eat gemstones and decide that because powerful creatures devour precious stones, the world has very few left. In fact, owning a gemstone makes you a target for hungry dragons who devoured most of what the earth has to offer and are searching for a last morsel.",
						"{@i ARCADIA 8} is an ode to monsters. While this issue isn't packed with new stat blocks, it does revolve around badass creatures. {@link Jessica Marcrum's|https://twitter.com/Miss_Jess03} \"Subclasses of the Hag\" turns one of the game's favorite creatures into warlock patrons, bard inspirations, and sorcerer progenitors. Dark deals and endless torments define hags. Why should the GM get to have all the fun? With this article, players can take the reins and tell their own hag-centered stories.",
						"\"Monstrous Components\" from {@link V.J. Harris|https://twitter.com/victhhe} is inspired by the lore and mechanics of monsters. Have you ever asked, \"Do material spell components really matter?\" Well, now they do. Get out those harvesting kits and start removing that dead aboleth's eyes, because those peepers are going to turn your spells into finishing moves.",
						"{@link Bianca Bickford's|https://twitter.com/BiancaBickford} \"The Emerald Exchange\" has one of the most fearsome monsters of all: a human with power and wealth who will do anything to keep both, including betray her friends. After all, wouldn't the allure of gathering as many powerful magic items as possible turn some heroes into the very monsters they battle?",

								"Well, yeah! Hear me out. :D",
								"Hey everybody, Matt Colville here! A lot of folks compare {@i ARCADIA} to the classic gaming magazines of yore, and this brings us great joy. At the same time, we're always thinking about ways to capture that same spirit (without severely impacting our schedule).",
								"Something I miss from those 1980s gaming magazines were ads! That may seem strange, but I literally miss them. As a consumer!",
								"For one thing, ads in gaming mags were usually cool. Or fun! You know, these are all small companies, creator owned, making nerd stuff for nerds and so even when I didn't particularly care about the product, it was still cool to see all these different games and accessories. It felt like you were part of a bigger community, not just of players and GMs, but of creators.",
								"Back then, ads in magazines were one of the only ways to learn about new products. Especially if the product came from a smaller company. Frankly, I feel the same way now! There are a ton of companies making cool products that even I don't know anything about, because the internet is huge and it's often impossible for a small company to get its product in front of the right audience.",
								"Since these companies were incredibly tiny and creative owned, owned by nerds, the ads often had personality, which I love.",
								"So, me, I never saw those ads as annoying. I miss them! I still see ads! They just suck. You do a bunch of research on suitcases, pull the trigger on a good suitcase you can afford, and now you see nothing but suitcase ads! Great, thanks. Perfect.",
								"It's amazing how much data these companies have about us, and yet how terrible online ads are. I was on a RPG discussion site and I noticed a banner ad for {@link Gaming Paper|https://gamingpaper.com/} which looked like exactly the kind of thing I needed and would use at my table. So I clicked on the ad! I bought some Gaming Paper, and I've been using it ever since.",
								"It is literally the only time I can remember where I clicked on an ad on a website. Because it's the only time I can remember where the ad was something I actually wanted!",
								"Given all this, we decided to try an experiment. We reached out to some creators we know and asked if they wanted to put an ad in {@i ARCADIA}. Our goal with ads is not to generate revenue (although they will do a little of that) but to put cool products in front of you, that we think you might like, but might not have heard of.",
								"These ads are curated. An ad appearing in {@i ARCADIA} is not an endorsement of the company or the product, but we do our research and want to make sure any ad in {@i ARCADIA} has a reasonable chance of being something we, as consumers, would buy. That's the criteria.",
								"It may seem hard to believe in this cynical world, but we really are introducing ads to {@i ARCADIA} primarily because we think it's neat. It's fun to see other gaming products you didn't know about, and we think it has the potential to be a lot more useful to you, the consumer, than the ads you normally see online, which I find to be pretty useless.",
								"Now, if you notice the ads in here, and they annoy you, please tell us! {@i ARCADIA} is always an experiment. If there's a great hue and cry against them, we'll rethink this whole thing.",
								"But we think they're neat! :D"

The oldest and wisest hags, grandmothers, play this deception so well that they inspire awe in their local communities and aspiring warlocks beg for their patronage. Some sorcerers are born from a hag bloodline and struggle to find acceptance from communities that fear their \"grannies.\" Bards tell stories of wicked witches in the woods, terrifying children and adults alike."

								"The wise woman in the woods with a gleam of mischief in her eye. The ancient crone who roams the streets, talking to alleycats. The kindly widow with the frightening smile. Hags embody humanity's fears of manipulation, getting lost, and, worst of all, growing old. Solitary and crafty, hags typically keep only animal familiars as companions. On occasion, however, hags come together in groups of three or more to form covens, greatly increasing their power and spellcasting ability. As rife with disagreement as they are affection, hags in a coven constantly vie for control over each other.",
								"All hags share a few key commonalities, regardless of their variety. Most come from the Feywild and possess the faerie fixation with deals. Hags always twist the odds of these pacts in their favor. Rare is the hag without a grand plan, and rarer still is one that resists the natural temptation to prey upon human nature, bending mortals' worst impulses for the hag's amusement. {@creature Green Hag||Green hags} particularly love to toy with mortal emotions. {@creature Night hag||Night hags} are partial to terrifying mortals to death, and {@creature sea hag||sea hags} relish destruction in all forms.",
								"The subclasses introduced in this article were developed around the legend of the hag, though any fairy-tale trickster could be used in their place. Perhaps a bard is inspired by the Big Bad Wolf, maybe a warlock seeks out Reynard the Fox, or perchance a sorcerer is descended from dreaded Queen Mab. The hag's legend looms large, but the world of faerie is vast and rife with tales to explore."

Quick to punish her warlocks for acting against her interests, a hag patron is opinionated and dedicated to molding her \"grandchildren.\" Warlocks who have an entire coven mentoring them typically also have to work around inter-coven politics, with each hag using the warlock to gain advantage over the other hags.",

For instance, grandmother sea hags fill watery caves with slime and rot, while grandmother green hags prefer dense marshes, forests, and swamps filled with animals to serve as her minions. Grandmother night hags live anywhere they find dreamers, twisting the very shadows to horrify their prey.",

She has a commission to retrieve a {@item portable hole} buried deep in a dungeon, but the location's entrance lies below a seedy tavern. The dungeon is a ruined lizardfolk city, one unexpectedly far more advanced in magic than recorded in history. The characters must find or make an entrance in the tavern basement and retrieve the item. The client, which Emerald never reveals, is the Magia Hand. They want the hole so they can easily transport stolen items. When the portable hole is returned, Emerald pays the characters 3,000 gp each."
