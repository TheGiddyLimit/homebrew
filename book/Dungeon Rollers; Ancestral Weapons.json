						"A noble blade wielded in the blood wars, an axe used to protect the great city of Mirabar from orc invasions, or a powerful staff passed down through the aeons. Ancestral weapons, heirlooms, are iconic within roleplaying. These weapons embody a character's family, story, and their history. These weapons are as important to many characters as their race, class, or background, to these people the opportunity to carry these items in their adventures is the true reward.",
						"Many of the legendary items within the Dungeons and Dragons universe could be classified as an ancestral weapon, such as the Blackstaff, wielded by the Archmage of Waterdeep. This powerful staff was originally wielded by Khelben Arunsun, and has been passed down through the ages, with seven generations now having wielded this powerful artifact. The holder of this staff becomes known by the same name as the weapon, Blackstaff, and becomes master of the Blackstaff Tower. Currently wielded by Vajra Safahr, this weapon is as important in the history books as whoever bears this powerful talisman. It is recognised by those near and far as a symbol of strength.",

From dealing thunder damage when you strike an opponent to giving the wielder the power of flight.

								"The rules for upgrading allow for three separate ways to develop an ancestral weapon. The first is for the player to choose their upgrades, deciding what suits their character better. The second option is that the Dungeon Master decides on the upgrades, building the item on a predetermined path based on its history. Third, a DM may choose the options based on a character's actions. All of these options are equally as effective and depends on the group and players within as to which style suits you best.",

All ancestral weapons are magical, even when no upgrades are unlocked. Whilst not being sentient weapons, the powers are at the whim of the ancestors who wielded it.

Despite its humble appearance, it exuded an extraordinary presence, that could deeply touch the soul of any who beheld it. When you are lost, the Homing Tree could find you, and would set you back on track. For those with a strong heart, The Homing Tree was a portal to wherever you most needed to be.",
										"Having existed for generations upon generation, nobody questioned when a few of its emerald green leaves started to turn a sickly yellow, or that it's rich floral scent started to have a sour undertone. When powers from the Shadowfell leaked into the Windswept Forest, the rottenness of the mirrored plane began to infect the tree from its roots. Triggered by an elemental build up a blinding fork of lightning struck its core, and shattered the tree to shards and splinters.",
										"The Staff of the Homing Tree, is the embodiment of this disillusioned Tree - it is bitter, broken, and lost. The Homing Staff finds you, and it can be a welcome companion or it can have a profound effect on its owner- for better or worse. A strike from The Homing Staff might cause little more than short sharp hit, or it might get beneath your skin like a charged current, and make you wonder where you are, who you are, or what the world might be like without you in it."

Stood atop the ramparts of its main gate, Ulric raised his blade high as the dragon assaulted with its lightning breath. The Windblade absorbed the damage and allowed Ulric time to cast his powerful incantation, sundering the dragon's mighty hide. Its bones now lay as a monument to the power of the weapon.",
