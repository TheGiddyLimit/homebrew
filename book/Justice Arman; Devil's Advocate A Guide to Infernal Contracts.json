Nevertheless, the world's greatest roleplaying game survived this moral panic, and fiends have been an important part of the hobby ever since. Just last year, {@book Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes|MTF} delved into the eternal struggle between devils and demons known as the Blood War, and this September will see the release of a hellscape-themed adventure, {@adventure Baldur's Gate: Descent into Avernus|BGDiA}.",

						"The first example of infernal law predates the Nine Hells themselves. As an angel, Asmodeus convinced the gods that their creations would only heed divine law if there were something to dissuade them from disobedience. Mortal creatures would then have the choice between upholding the word of the gods and Asmodeus's harsh alternative - punishment. After much deliberation, a lengthy decree was drafted by Asmodeus and agreed upon by the gods. It was called the Pact Primeval, the First Contract.",
						"The Pact Primeval granted Asmodeus and his allies dominion over the then-abandoned realm of Baator, which would eventually become the Nine Hells. It also established a procedure for the punishment of the wicked souls destined for its layers. However, over time, the gods found that a decreasing number of souls reached the Upper Planes because Asmodeus and his devils were deliberately tempting them. When the gods disputed the First Contract, claiming that Asmodeus had violated its terms, he dispassionately replied, \"Read the fine print.\" In addition to the Pact Primeval located in the Nine Hells, there are two other copies of the contract. One is housed on Mount Celestia, the Seven Heavens of Goodness and Law. The other is located on the clockwork plane of law, Mechanus."

						"At first glance, the contracts written by devils bear striking similarities to their mortal counterparts. There are numerous parallels between infernal law and the legal system administered on the Material Plane. Arbitration, precedent, and the concept of the accused standing trial before a jury are all found in both the Nine Hells and various settlements in the Forgotten Realms. A popular Candlekeep theory holds that the first legislators were ancient devils in disguise. By sowing familiarity with their proceedings, these early fiends had more success procuring souls from future generations. Some scholars even believe that the charismatic Mephistopheles was one of Faerun's first lawyers.",
						"However, conflating mortal and infernal law is a dangerous supposition. Devils have no moral code, and they only abide by {@i corpus juris infernis} (\"the body of infernal law\") and the archdevil that commands them. To the contract administrator, the ultimate goal is the procurement of the soul at its lowest possible cost. When a bearded devil jabs a rusty metal quill into the back of the creature serving as its inkwell, a soul is not special. It's not a unique ticket to the afterlife. Instead, it's a lifeless transaction. A quota to be met in hopes of future promotion. Fodder for a dusty hellfire engine that ran out of juice in Avernus. How could they possibly empathize with a signee? Devils are ruthless negotiators that only respect the letter of the law.",
						"While some differences are obvious - killing is permitted in the Nine Hells, for example, so long as it's justifiable in the Diabolical Courts of Phlegethos - the true threat lies in more subtle departures from mortal law. For example, when two livinig creatures exchange goods, there is generally the assumption of competency, i.e., both sides must be mentally capable of understanding their agreement in order to consent. Although.consent must be present in an infernal contract, there is no requirement of competency. This fact creates a fine line that many devils gleefully walk, extending handshakes to nostalgic nobles on their deathbeds or offering lengthy scrolls to grief-stricken widows who can hardly process new information."

In addition, trading life-years presents an opportunity for lesser fiends to chip away at mortals who may present an ongoing threat.",
										"A creature that enters into an agreement based on life-years surrenders a portion of its remaining mortality to a fiend. This way, those with longer life spans (i.e., dwarves, elves, and giants) cannot benefit from an ancestral advantage. If the signee is fortunate, their life is cut short by a number of years equal to the number of life-years considered. However, the majority of life-year agreements stipulate that the signee must serve a fiend for that amount of time post mortem. In these cases, the drafter typically acts as an agent of an archdevil.",
										"Upon death, the signee reports to the layer of the Nine Hells corresponding to the domain of the benefactor. The signee may perform menial tasks or hard labor as a slave, conduct or receive torture, or be enlisted as a soldier in the Blood War. Once this time is up, the soul is free to proceed t9 its original, intended destination unless the signee enters into additional agreements during that period.

						"These 6 infernal symbols can be placed to embellish your finished contract. They have no established meaning, though you can use that to your advantage. Perhaps they present a possible way to escape the ironclad agreement, such as the devil's true name or something they value. They could provide a link to a specific location or NPC by serving as the insignia of an infernal biker gang with six-wheeled contraptions. Maybe they are there to intimidate your characters by signifying that there will always be a degree of uncertainty to these types of agreements.",
