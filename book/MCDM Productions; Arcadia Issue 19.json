The following day, armed envoys from several kingdoms arrived to recruit Cato by force. The groups clashed, igniting a yearslong war. None entered the tower during the conflict, claiming the building was cursed.",

								"One of the hallmarks of epic fantasy stories is that the main characters are changed by their experiences, both good and bad. From discovering the love and support of a found family (like the kids in {@i Avatar: The Last Airbender}) to enduring intense stress and trauma (like Sam and Frodo in {@i The Lord of the Rings}), characters grow, develop, and emerge transformed. In fantasy roleplaying games, adventurers see horrors and confront monsters that set them apart from most NPCs and bind them together as a group. They share the weight of responsibility and know the high price of failure.",
								"In a way, these stories are heightened versions of our own comparatively humdrum existence\u2014as we \"adventure\" through life, we find that, gradually, we've changed and no longer fit where we used to. Perhaps this parallel is one of the reasons we're drawn to explore this theme through roleplay. It's a gentler alternative to the existential dread of reflecting on how our real-world responsibilities and traumas have changed us. Through our characters, we can subconsciously process our own changes and feel empowered to achieve our goals despite adversity, because we can press onward with support from our party (and much-needed long rests).",
								"We have a certain level of control in a game, too\u2014we can decide whether our character suffers nightmares after being swallowed by a purple worm, whether they merely shrug it off as yet another bizarre day, or a bit of both. Plus, even the worst challenges in RPGs (actually, {@i especially} the worst challenges) are rewarded with XP, so there's a built-in upside as part of the game. Sure, we used ourselves as bait and fought a dragon made of nightmares that manifested our greatest fears, put us to sleep, and made us attack each other, but at least our party leveled up and got cool new powers, right?{@sup {@footnote 1|See \"The Nightmare Dragon\" by Alex Clippinger in {@link ARCADIA 15|https://shop.mcdmproductions.com/collections/arcadia/products/arcadia-complete-bundle-issues-1-30}. It's a fun time. For the players. Probably not for the characters, though.}} The joy of roleplaying is that we can safely engage with our character's emotions as much as we want, choosing when to lean into the intensity and when to pull back if things get too grim. We can grow alongside our characters, but at our own pace.",
								"Each of this month's articles offers characters the chance to confront their flaws, fears, and mistakes as they press forward on their journeys. That sounds ominous and heavy\u2014but while dealing with a cursed weapon or a TPK might be A Bad Time for the party, it can be great fun for players who enjoy putting their characters through the wringer. And we get to balance the heaviness with as much silliness and humor as we want. Case in point: the characters slowly turning into beets and facing the prospect of being devoured by a hag is at least as absurd as it is horrifying. Oh, and that's {@i after} they all died.",
								"So if you accidentally TPK your party, {@link Justice Ramin Arman|https://twitter.com/justicearman} and {@link Anthony Joyce-Rivera|https://twitter.com/AJoyce_Rivera} have your back with \"Break in Case of TPK\"! (Or you might be tempted to purposefully kill your party so you can use one of these encounters.) {@link Jacky Leung|https://twitter.com/DeathByMage} presents three storied magic items with unexpected drawbacks in \"Cursed Treasures,\" as well as guidance for creating your own cursed items\u2014perhaps ones specifically tailored to the characters' weaknesses. And {@link Amber Litke|https://twitter.com/quantum_synergy} and {@link Sadie Lowry|https://twitter.com/incandescaent} are back with \"Divine Trials: Shadows of the Moon,\" a mini-dungeon where the characters must overcome not an external force of evil, but the darkness and fear within themselves.",
								"My gaming groups love to be silly and joke around, but we also love exploring the characters and seeing them grow, both in the ways we planned and in ways we never expected (which is one of the great joys of collaborative storytelling). Our characters laugh, cry, strategize, stress out, aid and comfort each other, and forge bonds through their experiences\u2014and, at the same time, so do we."

For each consecutive minute spent peering through the amulet, you can see 1 hour into the future (maximum 24 hours). The events you see unfold are only a possible future, which the amulet provides no context for aside from what you witness. Within a number of hours equal to the time you looked into the future, you can benefit from this foresight by making one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw with advantage within the area. Once used, this property can't be used again for 7 days, unless you expend a spell slot of 9th level to use it again."

								"The moon is the most mysterious of celestial bodies. For myriad cultures across the world, the moon can represent healing, the realm between consciousness and unconsciousness, inner knowledge, and even the life cycle of mortals, waxing and waning alongside them as they make their way through the world. To some, the moon is eerie, elusive, and enigmatic. To others, it's tranquil, protective, and revitalizing.",
								"Yet an ever-present question follows the moon in its eternal cycles: What lies on its unseen dark side?",
								"That mystery has long captivated mortalkind, and causes people to fill the moon's shadowed side with tales of terrors. These stories reflect the introspective question: What lies within a person's dark side, beyond their shining exterior? And when that ever-hidden side is finally revealed, what horrors will be seen to lurk and fester in each of us?",

										"Over centuries, a deity of wisdom grew increasingly frustrated with how those who have the potential for great acts of goodness can also cause great harm. With increased influence, power, and opportunities to change the world, a flawed hero has a greater chance to hurt others. The wisdom deity thus joined hands with a moon deity, and together they created the moon trial, tasking the moon deity's angel Artimitei to be its divine arbiter. Under her direction, heroes would see and face their faults under the light of the moon, with the hopes of heading off their worst inclinations as they approached ever-greater renown.",
										"As GM, you can create new lore for the moon trial as you see fit. Artimitei (room three) and Falathin (room one) are Celestial agents who might have additional connections to your campaign. Likewise, the moon trial can be made to manifest anywhere that heroes are in need of the lessons it can teach. Its entrance point typically appears as a curved archway in a place touched by both light and shadow: a mossy stone in the midst of the woods, a crumbling brick wall in a ruined village, a cavern entrance slick with water and fungi, and so forth. The moon trial's door always looks mysterious and eerie, as if hiding much in the unseen spaces beyond."

Characters who circumnavigate (read: cheat) the trials by skipping them, such as with the {@spell dimension door} spell, or by killing NPCs in non-combat challenges, find themselves redirected to the beginning of the challenge they sought to avoid with everything as it was when they first entered the room. This shouldn't dissuade creative and unconventional problem solving\u2014 thinking outside the box is encouraged, but cheating has consequences.",
										"If necessary, a disembodied divine voice tells heroes that their character is being tested, not their skullduggery, or gives a more direct warning.

										"The challenges of the moon trial require you as the GM to lean on the weaknesses of the characters. Prior to running the moon trial, think about whether any of the following are faults of any of the characters: cowardice, greed, recklessness, or wrath. If a character has more than one fault (many do!), pick the most prominent or problematic to address in the moon trial. Depending on the players, it might be prudent to discuss their characters' faults and whether they agree with your interpretation of them. This trial is much more satisfying with player buy-in.",
										"If a character's faults don't include one of the four faults noted above, you can choose whichever fault feels closest for the character, perhaps by having a conversation with the player. For example, you might select greed for a character whose fault is envy, either by spinning their envy as an avaricious desire for the things others have, or by adjusting the greed-based sections of the trial to lean into a rapacity for those things. Alternatively, if no suggested fault feels close enough, you can use the challenges as a guideline to create a customized experience that better fits the characters, both narratively and mechanically."
