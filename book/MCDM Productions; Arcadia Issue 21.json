								"This month's issue of {@i ARCADIA} is accompanied by a new resource: {@link a guide to using safety tools in your games|https://mcdm.gg/SafetyToolkit}. Some individual {@i ARCADIA} articles already include links to safety tools\u2014systems to help everyone at the table have a good time and handle potentially disturbing or upsetting themes with care\u2014but James and I thought it'd be nice to have a resource of our own for the MCDM community.",
								"We reached out to {@i ARCADIA} consultant and author {@link Sally Tamarkin|https://twitter.com/sallyt}, as well as gaming and psychology experts {@link Colette Brown, LMSW|https://twitter.com/DrKowert} and {@link Sarah Hayes, PsyD|https://twitter.com/drhayspsyd}, to create a \"toolkit\" of TTRPG safety tools, with guidance for using them with your group. One of my favorite tools is a checklist with topics for everyone to mark with their comfort level, so we made one of those, too! You can find both in the Resources section at the end of this issue (and future issues, too).",
								"Like everything else we make, we want the options and suggestions in this safety toolkit to be easy to add to your game, whether you're playing with friends of two decades or people who have only just met each other. And, like everything else we make, you don't have to use them, but we hope you'll check them out and see if there's something you want to try out.",
								"Honestly, I was hesitant when I first considered using safety tools for a casual one-shot. \"Do I {@i have} to go to the trouble?\" I thought to myself. \"Will the players be freaked out by this or mind that I'm asking them to fill this checklist out before our single game session?\" In the end, I approached it as casually as I could: \"Hey, I'm not planning on any super scary themes or mentions of [particularly heavy topic], but it's a good idea for us to do this anyway.\" And it was fine. In fact, it made me feel more confident about GMing for people I didn't know very well!",
								"Moreover, if you {@i are} planning on spooky themes, horror elements, or particularly heavy topics, these tools are incredibly useful for making your game scary in all the {@i right} ways. It's easy to think of safety tools as restrictions\u2014don't mention this, don't touch that\u2014but like any good framework, establishing boundaries creates empowerment and the confidence to explore. And {@i that} power, that freedom, that trust is what lets us tell the most intense, creepy, and heartrending stories.",
								"This October's {@i ARCADIA} articles are all delightfully {@s spoopy} spooky in their own ways. \"Hunting a Myth\" by {@link Celeste Conowitch|https://twitter.com/cconowitch} presents four cryptids, along with guidance for weaving cryptids into your stories. Death Worm, yes please (but also oh no). \"The Fiendish Regulars\" by {@link Banana Chan|https://twitter.com/bananachangames} brings comedic horror to your game with three \"normal\" NPCs who each have a unique relationship with the local ruler, despot, or BBEG. And last but not least, \"Puzzling Out the Devil\" by {@link Sharang Biswas|https://twitter.com/SharangBiswas} is a love story wrapped in a curse wrapped in four enigmas\u2014that is, puzzles!",
								"So go forth and dive into the words within these pages. They beckon you\u2014join us in this lush, shadowed, wicked corner of {@i ARCADIA}.",

						"The loose definition of a cryptid is a creature some claim exists but is never proven to exist. Cryptids are creatures of legend, but they aren't part of established mythologies and they don't follow archetypes the way other fantastic critters do. Fantasy creatures like dragons and unicorns feature in stories across the globe, and each culture's version of these creatures shares traits with the others. Conversely, stories about encounters with a cryptid vary from telling to telling, with witnesses attributing different sizes, behaviors, and characteristics to the same creature. In addition, a cryptid is tied to a single people and place. You can point on a map to places where cryptids have been seen, such as Loch Ness, the Pine Barrens of New Jersey, and the woods of the Pacific Northwest, but you can't point to the reported source of unicorns.",

The devil agreed to help, but demanded the Skormans' new baby, Johann, when he \"ripened.\" Eirik, expecting ample time to find a way out of the deal, agreed.",

The fiend quickly possessed Johann and attacked Laxman, but the apprentice was able to use knowledge gained from studying under Rukhmani to temporarily incapacitate the devil.
