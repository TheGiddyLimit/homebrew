								"This month's issue of {@i ARCADIA} is accompanied by a new resource: {@link a guide to using safety tools in your games|https://mcdm.gg/SafetyToolkit}. Some individual {@i ARCADIA} articles already include links to safety tools\u2014systems to help everyone at the table have a good time and handle potentially disturbing or upsetting themes with care\u2014but James and I thought it'd be nice to have a resource of our own for the MCDM community.",
								"We reached out to {@i ARCADIA} consultant and author {@link Sally Tamarkin|https://twitter.com/sallyt}, as well as gaming and psychology experts {@link Colette Brown, LMSW|https://twitter.com/DrKowert} and {@link Sarah Hayes, PsyD|https://twitter.com/drhayspsyd}, to create a \"toolkit\" of TTRPG safety tools, with guidance for using them with your group. One of my favorite tools is a checklist with topics for everyone to mark with their comfort level, so we made one of those, too! You can find both in the Resources section at the end of this issue (and future issues, too).",
								"Like everything else we make, we want the options and suggestions in this safety toolkit to be easy to add to your game, whether you're playing with friends of two decades or people who have only just met each other. And, like everything else we make, you don't have to use them, but we hope you'll check them out and see if there's something you want to try out.",
								"Honestly, I was hesitant when I first considered using safety tools for a casual one-shot. \"Do I {@i have} to go to the trouble?\" I thought to myself. \"Will the players be freaked out by this or mind that I'm asking them to fill this checklist out before our single game session?\" In the end, I approached it as casually as I could: \"Hey, I'm not planning on any super scary themes or mentions of [particularly heavy topic], but it's a good idea for us to do this anyway.\" And it was fine. In fact, it made me feel more confident about GMing for people I didn't know very well!",
								"Moreover, if you {@i are} planning on spooky themes, horror elements, or particularly heavy topics, these tools are incredibly useful for making your game scary in all the {@i right} ways. It's easy to think of safety tools as restrictions\u2014don't mention this, don't touch that\u2014but like any good framework, establishing boundaries creates empowerment and the confidence to explore. And {@i that} power, that freedom, that trust is what lets us tell the most intense, creepy, and heartrending stories.",
								"This October's {@i ARCADIA} articles are all delightfully {@s spoopy} spooky in their own ways. \"Hunting a Myth\" by {@link Celeste Conowitch|https://twitter.com/cconowitch} presents four cryptids, along with guidance for weaving cryptids into your stories. Death Worm, yes please (but also oh no). \"The Fiendish Regulars\" by {@link Banana Chan|https://twitter.com/bananachangames} brings comedic horror to your game with three \"normal\" NPCs who each have a unique relationship with the local ruler, despot, or BBEG. And last but not least, \"Puzzling Out the Devil\" by {@link Sharang Biswas|https://twitter.com/SharangBiswas} is a love story wrapped in a curse wrapped in four enigmas\u2014that is, puzzles!",
								"So go forth and dive into the words within these pages. They beckon you\u2014join us in this lush, shadowed, wicked corner of {@i ARCADIA}.",

						"The loose definition of a cryptid is a creature some claim exists but is never proven to exist. Cryptids are creatures of legend, but they aren't part of established mythologies and they don't follow archetypes the way other fantastic critters do. Fantasy creatures like dragons and unicorns feature in stories across the globe, and each culture's version of these creatures shares traits with the others. Conversely, stories about encounters with a cryptid vary from telling to telling, with witnesses attributing different sizes, behaviors, and characteristics to the same creature. In addition, a cryptid is tied to a single people and place. You can point on a map to places where cryptids have been seen, such as Loch Ness, the Pine Barrens of New Jersey, and the woods of the Pacific Northwest, but you can't point to the reported source of unicorns.",
						"In the game, cryptids are specific and rare enough (or cunning enough) to baffle scientists, clerics, or mages who wish to catalog them. Commoners in game worlds know dragons exist, but they might question the existence of {@creature Mothman|Arcadia21}, which makes hunting such a creature even more exciting. A cryptid's very existence defies explanation and forces folks to examine the trust they place in societal institutions, because governments, scholars, and other authorities repudiate that such creatures are real. And questions centered on truth, doubt, faith, and societal norms have a role in every genre.",

It's good practice to try to be aware of what you are and aren't including in your game!",
										"Other times, we want to feel powerful in the face of real-world oppression. For some players, confronting real-world inequalities can be meaningful and validating. (I've {@link written about that|https://nerves.games/2022/06/16/power-fantasies-in-rpgs-by-sharang-biswas/} for {@i Nerve}.) Still other players seek out games as a means to explore questions of identity and society. Sometimes, we {@i want} to seek out parallels to the real world in order to better understand our relationships to real-world issues.",
										"\"Puzzling Out The Devil\" includes themes of queer people hiding the truth about their sexuality. Queerness is not the central theme of this adventure, but it is an important one. It motivates NPCs, giving shape to their desires, to their backstories, to their personalities. I deliberately included such themes to allow the stories created at the gaming table to have more nuance, for characters to be more well rounded. Additionally, I'm a gay artist. I want my artwork to reflect issues I find important, and to ask my audiences to confront the fact that these issues exist.",
										"Discuss with your players that such themes exist in this adventure. Don't be afraid of \"getting it wrong.\" As I wrote for Camdon Wright's thoughtful RPG {@link One Child's Heart|https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/320505/One-Childs-Heart}, everyone makes mistakes when playing characters from communities outside their own, and \"what's important is to remember that identities are important, to be aware of your own biases, to recognize one's own mistakes and ignorances, and basically, to treat people as people.\"",
										"It might be helpful to use various calibration tools (sometimes called \"safety tools\") when running this adventure. In addtion to the MCDM Tabletop Safety Toolkit, Kienna Shaw and Lauren Bryant-Monk have produced an excellent compilation of popular tools called the {@link Tabletop Safety Toolkit|https://i.4pcdn.org/tg/1583202183294.pdf}. If your table is uncomfortable discussing or including such issues in your game, that's fine! I've included ways you can modify the adventure, and you're absolutely free to make any other changes you see fit."
