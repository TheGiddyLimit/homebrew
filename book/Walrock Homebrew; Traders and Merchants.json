Smelling profits on the wind, he ventures ever forward, seeking riches and glory for his clan.",

Each merchant has their own motivations for and methods of pursuing free enterprise, and for every merchant just trying to get by, there's at least one more with fervant dreams of someday. somehow, making it big and retiring to comfort and fortune.",

For example, a guidebook for local desert could confer advantage on a {@skill Survival} check to find food in that region, or a {@skill Nature} check to tell if a type of cactus is poisonous. Likewise, a guidebook detailing the anatomy and culture of dragons might grant advantage on {@skill Arcana} or {@skill History} checks concerning them, or even {@skill Persuasion} checks dealing sufficiently with the dragon's culture. These books are always tied to an area or a creature type within an area, and become less useful the further one travels from its intended region."

Likewise, a guidebook detailing the anatomy and culture of dragons might grant advantage on {@skill Arcana} or {@skill History} checks concerning them, or even {@skill Persuasion} checks dealing sufficiently with the dragon's culture.

Crop and flower seeds require 100 consecutive days of maintenance to mature fully, while trees require 1,800 days to begin producing seeds and fruit. A handful of crop or flower seeds can fill four 5-foot by 5-foot squares with their associated plant. The space a tree takes up varies greatly, depending on the type of tree and its age."
