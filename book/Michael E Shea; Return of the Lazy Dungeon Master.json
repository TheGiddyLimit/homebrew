People still talk about how that book remains a valuable resource for learning how to prepare less\u2014and to run better roleplaying games at the same time. For Dungeon Masters and other Gamemasters reading the original book today, the ideas found within it work just as well in our current games as they did in our games five years ago.",
								"So why write this new book?",
								"Because we've all learned a lot since then.",
								"Though {@i The Lazy Dungeon Master} holds up, there are always new ideas to add. We can polish and refine the original concepts with the experience of tens of thousands of Gamemasters to make them even more useful.",

Nothing has been copied over directly. Every idea has been reexamined and rewritten in the context of what we know today.",

If you prefer to skim the contents and pick out the topics that interest you, you'll likewise learn from it. If you find that these ideas resonate with you, you can reread or skim the book regularly to wire its concepts into your own mental GM's toolkit.

								"Those five words represent the core philosophy of the Lazy Dungeon Master. Our goal is to learn what parts of our RPG preparation and execution bring the most fun to our games. Our goal is to understand what benefits our games, and to separate that from what offers little value for the energy we spend in preparation.",
								"The way of the Lazy Dungeon Master, first stated five years ago in {@i The Lazy Dungeon Master}, begins with a simple initial idea:",
								{
									"type": "inset",
									"entries": [
										"We can spend less time preparing for our RPGs and still run great games."
									]
								},
								"In that earlier book, I hypothesized that all of us as GMs spend a lot of time preparing things for our games that offer little actual value to the players. So by boiling our preparation down to only the things that matter the most, we can save considerable time.",
								"While exploring this idea, however, I found another potentially deeper hypothesis:",
								{
									"type": "inset",
									"entries": [
										"The less we prepare, the better our games will be."
									]
								},
								"Now, this seems like something that can't possibly work. How is it even feasible that the less we put into our games before we run them, the more fun we'll have with our players at the table? But indeed, many Gamemasters\u2014including many GMs we might think of as experts and professionals within the hobby\u2014have found this to be true. The less we prepare, the better our games will be.",
								"Clearly, though, this idea works only up to a point. We can't take this notion to its mathematical conclusion of \"Prepare nothing, and your game will be infinitely more fun.\" Some GMs do state that they prepare nothing at all for their games, but those GMs are a small minority. The 2016 {@i Dungeons & Dragons} Dungeon Master survey, conducted at slyflourish.com, received responses from 6,600 fifth edition Dungeon Masters\u2014only 2 percent of whom said that they spent no time at all preparing for their games. This means that roughly 98 percent of us seem to agree that some game preparation is required to run a great game.",
								"Certainly, there is a point at which too little preparation can harm the fun of a game. Though we can often prepare less than we think we need to before a game, we must prepare something. And because all GMs are different, what we need to prepare to run an RPG session varies. Yet many of us instinctively cluster around a few key preparation steps that can help us prepare less and still run great games.",
								"Instinctively, each of us develops our own individual list of preparation activities by looking at every step we typically take and every technique we use while actually running a game. Then we ask ourselves, \"Is this really useful? Is this really fun? And does it bring enough joy to the game to be worth the effort?\" Each step and each component is worth drawing out under the cold, harsh light of reality, so that we can examine it dispassionately.",

								{
									"type": "inset",
									"entries": [
										"{@b Prepare what benefits your game.}"
									]
								},
								"It's easy to see that this simple statement has a negative space. In thinking about what best benefits our games, we can also think about what does not benefit our games\u2014and we can ask whether those things might best be discarded. If we extend our mantra into describing this negative space, we have the following:",
								{
									"type": "inset",
									"entries": [
										"{@b Prepare what benefits your game, and omit what does not.}"
									]
								},
								"This second part of the process can be hard. As GMs, we're all so rooted to the ways we've always done things that it's often difficult to let those ways go. We don't have to make a big plunge into abandoning what we've always done, though. Instead, we can run small experiments.",
								"We can {@b try things out.}",
								"We don't have to throw away five thousand dollars worth of miniatures to try running combat in the \"theater of the mind\" once or twice. We don't have to get rid of five hundred pounds of 3D terrain to try out the flexibility of a single blank poster map for a couple of sessions. We don't have to toss out a three-ring binder holding hundreds of pages of world building to try out some spiral campaign development.",
								"Trying out a new idea or removing a preparation step we typically take doesn't mean we have to do so forever. We just might give it a try for a game or two and see how it feels.",
								"For some Gamemasters, time is such a limited commodity that the question of what to throw away isn't the problem. Some GMs just don't have the time for a lot of game preparation\u2014even to the point where a lack of time prevents some would-be GMs from running games at all. Hopefully this book can help\u2014because preparing for a game requires less time than you might think.",
								"{@b Using the game preparation checklist in this book takes about fifteen to thirty minutes for a four-hour game.}",
								"So whether you're just looking for ways to refine your own game preparation or seeking a system that saves you time, this book hopefully has a few ideas that might resonate. Let's dig in.",

However, as GMs, all of us must always be ready to throw our potential scenes away when the game goes in a different direction\u2014as it often does. Usually, it's enough to come up with only a few words per scene, and to expect one or two scenes per hour of play. At other times, you might skip this step completely if you don't think you need it."

Secrets and clues are single short sentences that describe a clue, a piece of the story, or a piece of the world that the characters can discover during the game. You don't know exactly how the characters will discover these clues. As such, you'll want to {@b keep these secrets and clues abstract from their place of discovery} so that you can drop them into the game wherever it makes sense. This lets the game flow freely, while still allowing you to reveal important pieces of the story at any point where the characters might discover them.

										"Describe each location with a short evocative title such as \"The Sunspire.\" Then write down three fantastic aspects for it, along the lines of: \"Blazing beam of light shining to the heavens,\" \"Moat of molten rock,\" or \"Huge elven glyphs carved into ancient stone.\" Ultimately, whole dungeons can be built from a series of connected fantastic locations, with each location representing a large area or chamber.

										"When you give out magic items, the tangible benefits to the players' side of the game are immediately obvious. Magic items make players happy. They make characters more powerful and more versatile. In fact, in many cases, the right magic item can come to define a character.",
										"From the GM's side of the table, there's an even more important benefit. Magic items can become physical anchors to the story\u2014and by tying magic items to the story, it helps you tie the characters to the campaign.",
										"Magic items can fit into the story in two different ways. First and perhaps most commonly, a magic item might become the purpose of a quest. It is said that the hobgoblin half-dragon Volixus wields a greatsword known as Stonehewer, forged for the long-dead High Lord Grandel Whitesparrow. The current Lord Marlin Whitesparrow desperately wants to get the sword out of the hands of the villainous hobgoblin, offering a handsome reward to anyone who can slay Volixus\u2014and promising to bequeath the blade to the characters who reclaim it from the hands of evil.",
										"Magic items used to define quests offer a two-pronged benefit. They draw the players in for the sake of the tangible benefit of the item, even as they help drive the story. Few players will pass over a quest to acquire a magic item that's both central to the story and beneficial to the party.",
										"Magic items can also act as vehicles for secrets and clues. When the characters find a new magic item\u2014whether selected from a wish list or randomly generated\u2014 you can tie one of the campaign's secrets and clues directly to the item. When the characters reclaim the sword from the body of Volixus, they might learn how it was lost from the hand of Grandel Whitesparrow centuries ago during the last battles of Grayspire. Secrets and clues tied to magic items can easily and effectively expose the characters to the history of your world and the ongoing story."

You can't take the players' new toy away from them after you ruled that it worked the first time. So instead, solve the problem by letting the world evolve.",
										"The villains learn new tactics, spreading that information out to their minions. The giants learn that it isn't the ape they should be attacking, but the wizard whose concentration maintains the {@spell polymorph} spell. Other villains hire a band of mercenary wizards with the intent of counteracting new magical threats. The story of characters who can secretly transform {@item potions of healing|potion of healing} into alchemist's fire becomes a dark tale told among the ogres, who become especially careful about such things.",

(And that's about the only time you'll hear that advice in this book.) Instead, look for new ways to challenge the characters when they're due for a challenge. The rest of the time, let yourself enjoy watching them rip through the villains as much as the players enjoy it.",

At the start of the campaign (or at the start of each session if you want to pass the responsibility around), ask one of the players to take on the job of writing down initiative rolls and keeping track of the order of combat. Then when battle begins, initiative becomes one less thing you need to worry about.",

Multiple attacks, different attacks from certain monsters, and attacks from multiple monsters will provide more than enough variation to the amount of damage characters are taking. In many fantasy RPGs, monsters live only a few rounds anyway\u2014not long enough for the players to even notice that you're using average damage.

There are still any number of great stories for you and the players to experience in the lower levels of the game.

								"We've walked many paths through this book, and have explored many ideas. But each of us is still only at the start of our own personal journey. As GMs, we all develop our own individual styles for running RPGs. We make use of ideas we like and throw away those we don't. Some groups play the game with a loose style, glossing over details and focusing on big heroic fantasy. Other groups love to dive into those details. Ultimately, whatever style of play you and your group prefer is the right one.",
								"Whatever your style of play, if the concept of the Lazy Dungeon Master resonates with you, you're likely looking for ways to make game preparation and execution easier. Hopefully, as you've read or skimmed through this book, you've found ideas that you can make use of in your own personal GM's toolkit.",
								"The quotations and statistics that appear throughout this book have been chosen to support the hypothesis that less game preparation results in a more entertaining game. Other self-help books do the same thing\u2014choosing studies that support their premise, while conveniently leaving out studies that contradict that premise or support an alternative hypothesis. So let me give you some alternative statistics and information to avoid this trap.",
								"In the 2016 Dungeon Master survey I've cited repeatedly throughout this book, 16 percent of the 6,600 surveyed Dungeon Masters spend less than an hour on preparation, while 83 percent spend an hour or more. In general, a GM using the Lazy Dungeon Master's checklist should require about fifteen to thirty minutes to prepare a game. And yet only 16 percent of DMs spend that little time.",
								"In an interview I conducted with Matthew Mercer, the Dungeon Master for the popular Critical Role streaming game, Matt stated that he can spend up to three hours preparing for each hour of his game. Sure, Critical Role is broadcast to thousands of viewers, so Matt is more likely to want to spend time preparing for his game than you or I would. That doesn't mean we can dismiss how much time he believes is important to prepare his games.",
								"Matt isn't an amateur GM who simply doesn't know enough to reduce his prep time. He believes in the importance of his preparation. When we discussed NPC improvisation, Matt stated that if he had to improvise all his NPCs, it would \"certainly spike my anxiety.\" Avoiding anxiety is exactly why we want to spend some time preparing for our games.",
								"Throughout this book, we've described a process for building an entire campaign with little more than a theme, six truths, and some fronts. Many GMs build out entire detailed worlds, featuring pantheons, continents, empires, ancient histories, and huge political struggles. Developing these sorts of worlds is the \"lonely fun\" that makes fantasy RPGs come to life for those GMs. They love doing it. Just by virtue of how much effort it takes, building an entire world certainly isn't lazy\u2014but that doesn't mean it's wrong. Creating that kind of detailed background is only wrong if it takes away from the fun of the game itself.",
								"Each of us will build and develop our own individual process for preparing and running our RPGs. This book focuses on reducing prep time to improve our games. It's offered many ideas built around this central goal. In the end, though, only you get to choose which tools to add to your own personal GM's toolkit, and which tools will ultimately become a permanent part of your own gaming style.",
