								"Imagine you have been running a game of 5th Edition for some time now, and the characters have passed the 10th level benchmark. As their powers increase, you find yourself struggling to field compelling foes that threaten these seemingly invincible heroes with defeat. As you scour the world in search of resources to improve your game's monsters, you find yourself spending more and more time customizing a handful of foes to meet your encounter needs. It's exhausting, time-consuming, and frustrating to see an ambush undone by a simple {@spell banishment} spell or to watch your dragon boss fight be butchered in a single turn by a paladin's critical. This pain has driven many an experienced DM to retire a campaign when it should be at its most exciting. Whether you are looking for a solution to these aforementioned problems or just need some deadly, high-level foes for your next game, the {@i Total Party Kill Bestiary} is here to inspire fear and shred character sheets, no matter the level of your players' characters.",
								"The creatures in this book will eat skilled adventurers for breakfast. Overconfident or careless characters will find themselves petrified by the song of a beautiful fey bird, slain instantly by an undead horseman heralding death, or the favorite chew toy of a ravenous brown dragon. These monsters will feel right at home in your game world, lurking in its darkest corners or conquering nations. Bizarre, mysterious, malevolent, or virtuous, these creatures are exclusively high-level threats suitable only for veteran heroes. Wherever these foes appear, they will make an impact, putting your players' skills to the test and contributing to a vibrant and dangerous campaign.",

It also contains some pretty dark and gruesome critters that will do gnarly stuff to PCs who encounter them. We feel that such designs add an air of menace and danger that inspires real fear and disgust in players; emotions can be just as important to the RPG experience as fun, laughs, and thrills. However, that doesn't mean they are for everyone, and you should take the prospect of integrating creatures that push this boundary seriously. The last thing we want is to see someone walk away from your game table because of something we made, so please talk to your players about how far you can push violence against their characters using some of the monsters contained with these pages. You don't have to give everything away but do your best to ensure the people at your table don't get hurt."

In addition to a group's combat statistics, also included are crucial tactical information to run challenging encounters, lore to seamlessly integrate these creatures into your game world, and other fun details that showcases monsters like never before. Almost every monster found within this book has a challenge rating of 10 or higher and is designed to withstand some of the greatest high-level character strengths. This is not another monster encyclopedia. This book's content is intended to be used in a way most appropriate for your game and empowers you to do so.

										"Monsters within this book are compiled into thematic groups that share a background, lore, and ecology; imaginatively named \"monster groups.\" Each monster group section contains its members' combat classifications, favors and foils, which member possesses the fearsome \"TPK brand,\" lore, tactics, plot hooks, treasure, ecology, and special notes by iconic gnome bard, Talien Vos Karven. This section details the significance of each of those elements, which are critical for you to understand to achieve best results when designing encounters featuring said monsters.",
										"{@b Monster Classifications}",
										"Monsters within this book are classified into groups based on their strengths and abilities, which helps a DM easily understand their role on the battlefield. Each monster possesses a classification, with the most powerful among them being \"Elites\" who are proficient in multiple classifications simultaneously. By understanding this system of classifications, you can craft encounters that deliver on a specific challenge you want your players to experience. Do you want your heroes to dodge sniper fire as they storm a fortress? Use an artillery creature. Looking for a fearsome beast that crushes adventurers beneath its feet? Try a brute. Perhaps you need a final boss for your dungeon, in which case all you must do is find an appropriate elite. This system is a throwback to 4th Edition and helps create encounters that deliver on a specific style of play. The details of each monster classification and how to use them can be found in this section.",
										"{@b Artillery.} The artillery classification indicates ranged combat specialists with abilities that can harry enemies from afar. Only the best snipers can match an artillery creature at ranged combat, which can often unleash firepower that puts even the most optimized {@spell eldritch blast}-slinging warlock to shame. Artillery creatures are vulnerable at close range, relying on allies or their own evasive abilities to stay out of melee. An artillery wants to end a fight from afar, keeping its enemies on the defensive and struggling to find cover.",
										"{@b Brute.} Brutes are brutal melee combatants specializing in giving out as much punishment as they take. Free from player interference, a brute quickly pulverizes vulnerable characters and dismantles tactical advantages. Brutes can be counted on to take powerful hits and often do so to protect vulnerable allies or objectives. A brute seeks to be the focus of a fight, soaking up punishment and returning the favor tenfold.",
										"{@b Controller.} Controllers may not be the ones who kill a character, but they certainly make things easier for their allies. Controllers unleash debilitating effects that impair or cripple their enemies and are most effective when paired with more directly lethal creatures able to capitalize on advantages the controller provides. A controller wants to secure victory through tactical superiority, placing itself and its allies into a winning position, the tabletop equivalent of setting up a checkmate.",
										"{@b Elite.} Elites are monsters with enough diverse strengths to fit multiple classifications. Only the most powerful of creatures are elites and possess few weaknesses that adventurers can exploit. As rare as they are powerful, elites can be considered bosses that lurk at the end of a dangerous dungeon or the climax of an epic adventure. An elite is often legendary and crushes opposition with overwhelming power.",
										"{@b Leader.} Leaders are masterful support creatures that aid allies with healing, magical enchantment, and other powerful buffs. Leaders rarely possess significant kill potential, focusing instead on teamwork and keeping their deadly allies in top fighting shape. Leaders need at least a few allies to help, preferring those that help them accomplish their encounter objectives. In combat, a leader alleviates harm on its allies, undoing damage with an efficiency that is nearly impossible to outclass.",

A lurker seeks to systematically and swiftly eliminate threats, taking heroes out of commission before they have a chance to respond.",

												"The {@i Total Party Kill Bestiary} features a number of creatures with a unique set of traits, summarized by classifying it as a titanic creature. A titanic creature is truly massive - with a unique anatomy that doesn't make sense for it to be treated as a single target. It has multiple sections, each of which functions like an independent creature, relying on the monster's core statistics for most of its effects. Each section has the same AC, resistances, immunities, and saving throw bonuses as the base statistical block of the creature. Sections are affected by conditions and other effects individually, unless explicity stated otherwise in the section's traits. A titanic creature's statistics describe how much space the creature takes up along with each of its sections, as well as its height. If you're using physical miniatures, you're unlikely to have a massive miniature that's appropriate, so you have may to improvise something. Because a titanic creature is so big, creatures smaller than it can always occupy the same space, or move through the titanic creature's space without penalty, and titanic creatures neither take nor provoke opportunity attacks.",
												"Every titanic creature has a core section. If the \"core\" section is reduced to zero hit points, the titanic creature is slain. Other sections that are reduced to zero hit points become {@condition incapacitated} for as long as it has zero hit points, but the creature as a whole remains alive and well. Some creatures can restore {@condition incapacitated} sections during a fight while other's cant. In general, unless a titanic creature has an ability that allows it to restore an {@condition incapacitated} section, it can only do so if it finishes a long rest, which allows each section to individually spend Hit Dice to recover hit points.",
												"In combat, every section has a fixed initiative result that it acts on. On each section's turn, if that section has a speed, the entire creature can move during that section's turn, following normal rules for movement. In some cases, a creature may have a certain speed on a specific section's turn, such as a dragon with a \"wings\" section only having a fly speed when its \"wings\" act.",
												"Characters can attempt to climb a Titanic creature as part of their movement by making an {@skill Athletics} or {@skill Acrobatics} check (their choice) opposed by the creature's {@skill Athletics} or {@skill Acrobatics} check (DM's choice). Success means they can move up to half their speed along the creature, failure means they stay where they are, whether that's on the ground or upon the creature. Making this attempt doesn't require an action, but a creature can only attempt it once per turn. If a creature takes damage while climbing a titanic creature or a forced movement effect would push or pull them while climbing, they must make a Strength or Dexterity saving throw (their choice) against a DC of half the damage taken or 10, whichever is higher. Success means they hold on, remaining where they are. Failure means they fall, dropping to the ground in the titanic creature's space and taking falling damage as appropriate. Titanic creatures have disadvantage on all attacks against creatures that are currently climbing them.",
												"You should use your best judgement when it comes to targeting a creature's sections. Ranged attacks should be able to target any section if the caster is within range of the creature, but melee attacks and touch spells can only target sections the character should conceivably reach. A fighter with a sword, for example, isn't going to be able to attack the head of a 60-foot tall golem, he'll be stuck hacking at the legs.",
												"Likewise, use your best judgment when it comes to applying a status effects to the titanic creature. Casting {@spell dominate monster} on a dragon's tail, for example, probably won't work. It would need to target the creature's head or its core to be effective. Likewise, you probably can't knock a golem's arm {@condition prone}. Otherwise, most effects will only affect one section of the creature. For example, you could stun a creature's arms or legs, preventing them from acting, but the rest of the creature would act as normal. Finally, most titanic creatures are immune to forced movement and teleportation effects unless they wish to be affected.",

When your players want to research a foe before facing it in battle, you can allow them to attempt certain group ability checks to gain valuable lore that will improve their odds of success against it. Groups wishing to attempt such checks should make significant efforts to even attempt the roll\u2014gathering evidence, tracking movements, consulting wise beings, or delving through forgotten tomes. Once the party has done so, they may attempt a group ability check as detailed in the monster's lore section. Depending on the result, the party gains valuable information about the monster's behavior and abilities, examples of which are found in each monster's lore table. You should alter this section and the lore therein at your discretion to better fit your game world. Unless the characters are extremely powerful, give them a chance to gain lore about creatures found in this book. It can make for a meaningful downtime activity between adventurers, and odds are it won't spoil the encounter. If they choose to pass on the opportunity, the players have no one to blame but themselves when your monster lays them out.",

										"Monsters with a high challenge rating are far more complicated than their low-class comrades. This makes the DM's job harder, so it is essential to combat the ever-expanding powers characters attain at high levels. To mitigate the challenges of running encounters featuring complex creatures, each monster has a tactics section with recommended average, easier, and harder tactics.

										"{@b Treasure}",
										"A hard-won victory deserves a suitable reward, and many of the creatures in the {@i Total Party Kill Bestiary} possess valuable equipment or are made of rare components that can be forged into useful items. When a monster has a treasure section, it is still at your discretion what the characters receive as a reward after defeating the monster. However, it is recommended you grant these rewards for particularly demanding encounters. On top of making victory taste all the sweeter, such treasures serve as trophies to remind players about their past conflicts and make for a good story to tell at the local tavern.",
										"{@b Ecology}",
										"Even the most fiendish of monsters have a home, and their ecology section details where they prefer to live, explore, and hunt. Use a creature's ecology when considering its role in your game world. While you can certainly plop any monster into a dungeon without context, creatures of power have a difficult time existing without making some impact on the world around them.

As a creature's chance to hit, save DCs, AC, and other features improve, so too do its odds of success in its endeavors or chance of foiling its attackers. Where the d20 eas once the biggest factor in determining success at lower levels, at high levels a creatures' (or character's) significant bonuses to their advantages weigh more heavily. A creature with a +20 to hit is probably going to land most of its attacks regardless of its d20 rolls, and its damage rolls are going to be more consistent with a +10 bonus from its Strength. With the exception of the natural 1 and natural 20, this means you can expect a more average result from creatures in your encounters with fewer twists from wacky rolls. Beware! This consistency also applies to your encounter's weaknesses. Having no bonuses to an Intelligence saving throw means your creature has almost no chance of beating a DC 19 saving throw versus a {@spell feeblemind} spell. While this truth requires more forethought when building your encounters, it also makes predicting encounter outcomes and dynamics a lot easier.

The Swallow Whole attack can take a character out of the fight temporarily and is great when used against some rogues and spellcasters who may struggle to do enough damage to free themselves.",

With advantage on Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) checks, this essence also excels against any characters that rely on being hidden.",

Follow the general advice for easier encounters: spread damage out among the party, wait a round or two before using limited-use abilities, and provoke a few opportunity attacks while moving around. You can also give the party an easier time by putting the hybrid in a large, wide-open area where its relatively slow speed gives the party a chance to pick it apart with ranged attacks.",
						"{@b Harder Tactics} - Ambushes are a great way to start a fight, and with both the {@optfeature essence of spider|TPk} and octopus providing advantage on Dexterity ({@skill Stealth}) checks, it's easy to make a hybrid with a talent for concealing itself. Most essence options also add a way for the hybrid to grapple a creature, and since the hybrids are Huge in size, they can move a Medium creature they are grappling without being slowed down. Combine that with swim, fly, or climb speeds and a hybrid can easily split the party by pulling one character into a hard-to-reach spot before tearing into them."

						"Among the many faiths in the world, a common theme can be found: the end of the world. Every source of divine knowledge warns of the coming apocalypse, and while each tale is different, there are threads that unite them all. Every Armageddon has a harbinger. Inspired by these stories, a cabal of necromancers sought to forge their own heralds of destruction. With profane magic and cruel genius, the apocalypse dragoons were wrought; undead terrors possessing unholy power and an unceasing commitment to destruction. Famine, war, pestilence, and death are their colors, heralding the ruin each brings to mortal realms. Only the most powerful or bafflingly foolish of necromancers dare create these abominations. Only other undead are safe in the presence of the dragoons, whose intolerance for the ordered ways of the living puts even the most murderous psychopaths to shame. It is said that if all four dragoons ride together, the world of the living will fall. A circumstance that thankfully has not come to pass.",

								"Fancifully termed \"apocalypse dragoons\" after an old human empire's cavalry, there is little that is whimsical about them. Before we delve into each individual variation, I must correct a false mythology that has sprung up. These are not true harbingers of the last days, and they are not gods. Such an idea is preposterous beyond explaining, but I will endeavor to do so. Apocalypse dragoons are undead, and they are created by powerful necromancers, typically liches, to accomplish a singular purpose. I have seen more than one of each type. Well, almost each one. Only one necromancer ever successfully created a {@creature champion of death|TPK}, and I had to call in the only favor Elkus Dalgren has ever owed me to convince him to reduce it to dust and ash. He was kind enough to obliterate the necromancer as well."

Move around a lot, potentially ending more than 30 feet away from some of the party, sparing them from Aura of Starvation. As a final tweak, consider using Wither or Uncanny Dodge sparsely.",

Granted, his hesitation was because he had to find time between fending off a demonic incursion and founding another alcoholism support group, but all the same, one should not take these avatars of death lightly if one enjoys being alive."

Guarded by ancient wards, no blade or spell could harm him, and all who rose against him were put to the sword. Soon no heroes remained to oppose the tyrant. One day, as the king lounged in his throne, a ranger approached. Old and wise, she offered to entertain the king with a display of her pets. Among them, a shimmering orange-yellow cobra. The king leaned forward, captivated by its resemblance to molten gold. The ranger offered the serpent to the king, and he took it gingerly. \"Be careful, he bites,\" were the last words the king heard before the snake's fangs plunged into his neck. Evidently his blessing of protection didn't consider teeth to be blades. The moral is, of course: be exactingly specific when dealing with magic."

This treasure is placed strategically throughout its structure, with hopes of luring explorers deeper into the mimic's maze of hallways and corridors. One room may be a banquet hall glistening with jeweled cutlery, while another an armory filled with mithril weaponry. In addition to this treasure, a living keep's core generates an extraordinary gem for reasons yet unknown. Known as a crownstone, these gems are nearly a foot in diameter and are deep, blood red, smoldering with a fiery light. They are prized by royalty for their capacity to be carved into elaborate jewelry made of solid gemstone and are typically auctioned for over 100,000 gp a gem."

										"Living keeps are far too conspicuous for civilized society. Unless it feeds on at least a dozen humanoids a year, it will quickly starve, entering a period of hibernation until food becomes available. Living keeps can remain in this state for centuries before succumbing and take at least a month to fully awaken. In the meantime, communities may form around its structure, providing the keep with a reliable source of food. All it takes is a handful of curious adventurers exploring the local abandoned castle to stir its slumber. Once active, a living keep is a cunning, patient predator. It will often allow survivors expeditions to escape, returning to tell stories of haunted corridors and wonderous treasures. If its true nature is revealed to the world at large, the keep flees the locale in the dead of night, trundling across the landscape. During this time, it will reshape into a new form, adapting its architecture to reflect the first culture it comes across. Undead and other inedible creatures may find a welcome home within a living keep, just as long as they don't blow its cover or take its food."

Those that are able to feast with great regularity rapidly mature, circumventing a typical dragon's normally slow rate of growth.

										"Earth archons are as simple in battle as they are at any other time. They are a little faster than the average humanoid but are better served entering battle from beneath the ground using their burrowing speed and Superior Earth Glide. In a fight an earth archon wants to get close to as many characters as possible to use Twisting Roots and Stone Flail to full effect. Attacking a {@condition restrained} character with Stone Flail makes the attack much less likely to miss, and with only one attack every turn, a miss hurts a lot. The archon has no fear of melee combat between its resistance to physical damage and Hungry Earth trait, and it actively seeks out powerful combatants to neutralize them by taking hits. Though unarmed strikes are technically melee weapons, don't let the earth archon pull anyone's hands off. When building an encounter around an earth archon, look for monsters that have ranged attacks and supporting spells. The earth archon is vulnerable to disabling spells such as {@spell forcecage}, and having allies who can disrupt concentration or cast {@spell counterspell} will help the archon do what it does best.",

A raging barbarian or well-armored paladin can go toe to toe with an earth archon for at least a few rounds, and they have the hit points and high Constitution saving throws to endure some hits of Stone Flail. They are vulnerable to Twisting Roots, but if the archon stays far enough away that only the front line is hit, it won't make the encounter too challenging.",
										"{@b Harder Tactics} - An ambush by an earth archon is devastating. It can spring up and use Twisting Roots to target the entire party, then hit somebody fragile with its Stone Flail attack. If you want to get tricky, once it restrains a couple of fragile characters, have the archon burrow 10 feet into the ground and start moving through the earth, dragging the {@condition restrained} characters with it. If the party is busy dealing with other monsters, being split up like this is catastrophic."

The longer the fight goes on, the more dangerous that trait becomes, both to the party and to any allies of the fire archon who aren't immune to fire damage.

Finally, unless the archon has a good reason to fight to the death, it should try to retreat when its Superheated Being trait reaches a radius of 40 feet. When building an encounter around a fire archon, select allied monsters with care, particularly if they are not at least resistant to fire damage. Creatures that are vulnerable to fire damage are likely to die much faster in the company of a fire archon, but it can make for an interesting free-for-all fight.",

Get up in the middle of the group as quickly as possible and try to restrain characters with Pitchfork to keep them in a tight group.

								"Finally, a creature that isn't a nightmare and a half to get data on. While the enokitake are difficult to find, it is well worth the effort. These creatures are peaceful almost to the point of absurdity, living a communal existence that necessitates intimacy. I found the enokitake sympathetic and sensitive to my emotions like no humanoid ever was, compelling me to share my most private thoughts and feelings. It was an almost...spiritual experience. For the troubled, desperate, or lonely, I recommend a brief therapeutic stay among these fungal life forms. Prolonged exposure to their empathic abilities can be stressful, however, as you lose any sense of privacy about your emotional state. I can think of more than a few adventuring companions who would not appreciate the enokitake's compassionate, hands-on approach to negative emotions. Pain and suffering can have merits, but to the enokitake such feelings afflict their entire community."

								"Unless your players are running a party of vicious bastards, chances are most encounters with enokitake can be resolved peacefully. In a bestiary fully of a deadly threats, it may seem counterintuitive to make use of these creatures. However, not every monster encounter needs to result in an epic throw-down, especially at high levels. Monsters that aren't just foes to be massacred are great for encounters, as long as they provide a compelling alternative. Having monsters like enokitake in your game world is important. They breath life into its deepest corners, teaching your players that between tyrannous dragons and vile fiends there are interesting beings full of mystery and wonder. Enokitake are designed to make an impression on your players, whether through combat, roleplay, or story. Our hope is that a good experience with creatures like these will inspire you to make more like them, filling your world with beings that are not mere walking loot and experience piñatas. They can be something special around which the party has a deep emotional experience."

Their naked ambition to attain such an existence was all too clear, but to my surprise none seemed to have a clear understanding of how to attain such a state, or even where to start. If you are a lich and you are reading this, know that I have deliberately omitted key details about my finding to prevent you from expanding your powers and further menacing the world.

								"A lich's signature feature is the ability to return to life after being slain, so long as its phylactery is intact. This cycle of rejuvenation can prove very troublesome for adventurers, who may have repeated encounters with the same lich until they can hunt down the object and destroy it. While this makes a lich a frustrating enemy, it does not make single encounters with the lich any more difficult. When using liches to challenge your players, we recommend that you not award them experience for defeating it unless its phylactery is destroyed. This prevents the lich from being an \"XP farm\" or causing other strange interactions with character advancement. Additionally, the challenge rating of the liches presented here does not factor in their ability to rejuvenate, as each encounter with the lich may vary wildly depending on the circumstances. The exception to this is the {@creature eternal lich|TPK}, which can recover so quickly that any encounter with the creature requires a party act swiftly to ensure the liches demise if they do not wish to face dire consequences."

										"Champion fist are simple, powerful creatures. They exclusively attack whichever character commits enough evil to attract the attention of a hammer angel. If it can't reach its target by simply moving, or if it would take more than one opportunity attack to do so, a champion fist uses Pristine Positioning to close the distance safely. Otherwise, it uses Flurry of Blows every time it is available and Angelic Reach when it is not.

If the hammer angel can close to melee range with its target, make its two attacks, and then use Pristine Positioning, it can spend its entire remaining flying movement to escape. If it can get out of range and line of sight with 120 feet of movement or less, on its next turn it can use Pristine Positioning again to move 120 feet into melee, attack, and then retreat. While this tactic prevents it from using Flurry of Blows, reducing its damage output slightly, it massively increases the champion fist's survivability by forcing the party to rely on readied actions. Characters with the {@feat Sentinel} feat counter this tactic completely, so you should either utilize it as a possible opportunity to make a player feel successful or avoid using it altogether."

It is the sad fates of such innocents that give rise to the lynchwoods.

										"The bloodbark executioner makes for an incredibly unique encounter. Because it cannot move, the characters will typically get to choose how they engage with the creature. Use Perfect Camouflage and Cacophony of the Condemned to even the playing field and draw the characters into suboptimal position. Your goal is to get the majority of the party within 200 feet of the executioner so that it can make Ensnare attacks. The effects of Ensnare combined with Hoist are deadly, decapitating characters in a few short rounds. The executioner has a host of other powerful effects in play. Use Bite to swallow troublesome melee characters that refuse to be strangled, and disrupt frustrating magical effects with Drain Magic. The executioner has a ton of hit points across all of its sections, so it can afford to play the long game for the right moment to strike. If the characters are proving too coordinated for the executioner to handle, use Visions of Atrocity to disrupt them. Many class features, like paladin auras, can only affect allied creatures, so have your characters check their features to see what no longer works under this effect. Keep sections in play with Unified Being and Nourish. Ideally the characters will need to take out the majority of the sections before finally slaying the executioner.",

This is bad news for anyone who fails Cacophony's save, as all affected characters rush toward the executioner at top speed. Immediately use Drain Magic on the most powerful magical effects, especially {@spell freedom of movement} or similar effects. Have the core ready its Bite action, then put a target in a Blood Pond before unleashing the Bite.

Today all that remains of their civilization is ruins, but some scholars believe pockets of Nartheneen still exist. Marked by long legs with backward-jointed knees, six fingers on each hand, and the heads of animals, the Nartheneen are not likely to pass unnoticed in modern society. Their culture is defined by rigid meritocracy and a clearly defined but highly mobile caste system, with members of each caste marked by replacing their heads with those of animals. Though each Nartheneen is born into a caste, through an arcane ritual they can transmute their bodies into new forms better suited to their aptitudes.",
						"There are six castes, divided into three \"lesser\" and three \"greater\" castes, although the words are imperfectly translated from the Nartheneen language. More accurately, the \"lesser\" castes are many in number and fulfill the most fundamental needs of the society: food, infrastructure, and trade. The \"greater\" castes are restricted to the most exceptional individuals and cover the loftier pursuits of scholas, priests, and warriors. It is noteworthy that the most combat-capable Nartheneen are among the greater castes, implying the significance of war in their society.",

The testimony of a group of adventurers who claim to have traveled back to and from the height of the Nartheneen civilization is hardly scholarly. With that clarified, the Nartheneen are nonetheless a fascinating and study in differing cultural norms and well worthy of consideration. Their meritocracy was relentless, and each caste believed itself to be the most essential to its society's function. Yet they bore no ill will toward the other castes, for they were all aware that the others felt as they did. It was this common feeling of utmost importance that paradoxically united them, allowing them to act with coordination toward common goals.",

A foul entity called the Ebon Flame, the details of which remain vague even under my scrutiny, corrupted them with the promise of great magics\u2014a promise it delivered upon but which carried a cost beyond imagining. Even now, I have several of my associates keeping watch for mentions of this Ebon Flame. If it ever returns to our world, we will be ready.",

It favors the fey realm and the material plane, but it has been sighted on other planes of existence as well.

Those attempting to predict when the tasey-am will be have found some success through divination magic, noting it consistently appears in areas that undergo rapid change in short periods of time. As humanoids are often most responsible for this type of action, the encounters between the tasey-am and intelligent races have grown more frequent and dangerous."

Remember that creatures that would be immune to fire damage instead have resistance against the ashcaller. Try to spread the ashcaller's damage out as much as possible between characters. It's going to be too much to handle for all but the most dedicated healers to keep up with, and it ensures the characters stay on the defensive.

Note the world breaker's obscene speed on its legs, along with damage on attacks that surpasses anything else found in this book.

This includes objects and structures, allowing a worldbreaker to literally punch through solid barriers and strike targets behind cover. Additionally, a critical hit from one of the worldbreaker's most powerful attacks is usually enough to one-shot a character, so be careful when attacking with advantage.

Countless historical examples point to revolutions and uprisings against overwhelming forces in pursuit of freedom. It is within this in mind that I say to you, gracious humility is the cruellest of all the heavenly virtues. A strange sentence for one not familiar with the virtues in their celestial manifestations, but I assure you it will make sense as you continue to read. A gracious humility entombs its foes in a microcosmic penitentiary that resembles a paradise. There they serve out a sentence that lasts until the creature is redeemed and properly humbled in the eyes of the holy virtue. Generally, this takes centuries, long enough that most of the victims perish of old age before achieving redemption."

Drakopteras build their hives in caves or high in the trees, which are typically massive structures formed from a mixture of paper, bones, and local flora. These creatures lack the sense of coordination and synergy found in most collaborative insects and immediately unbalance whatever ecosystem they occupy. Finding a drakoptera or its hive is therefore quite easy\u2014simply follow the trail of destruction and the buzz of giant wings."

										"The null tide is a complex creature with a lot of abilities and the multitude of combat options that come from being a spellcaster. First, don't forget its core voidborn traits: Draining Aura and Void Resilience. When casting spells, remember the Voidcasting trait causes hit point loss, rather than damage, which allows the creature to bypass damage resistances and immunities. Choosing which spells to cast is the trickiest part of running the null tide. Start using high-level spells first. {@spell Chain lightning} is a great choice if a party is clustered together. {@spell Feeblemind} works extremely well against characters with low Intelligence, typically barbarians and paladins, but can also shut down some Charisma- and Wisdom-based spellcasters. Once the null tide is concentrating on something, use {@spell cone of cold} for more damage or a higher-level spell slot to cast {@spell chain lightning} again. Use {@spell banishment} if one character in the party is dangerous and has low Charisma, or a high-level {@spell hold person} to immobilize multiple characters. {@spell Ice storm} and {@spell tidal wave|XGE} are good sources of extra damage if the null tide is already concentrating on a spell.",

The priest felt light shining from the cubs and their mother, a source of unrestrained divine power. But the priest was deceived. Under his care the light turned dark. The void, lurking in the recesses of the prima divinity, consumed the hyenas. Fighting desperately, the mother hyena died within sight of her helpless cubs. The infants gave in to the void, their mewling sadness blossoming into white-hot fury.",

Possessing sharp teeth, a chilling laugh, and a dark hunger, Eira is a ferocious killer with the mind of a child. Known as the cackle of lost souls, she stalks priests and other servants of the gods, hoping one more death will purge her of the pain of their mother's death."

A concert has no sense of self-preservation and is short lived, running itself to the point of complete physical breakdown in pursuit of prey. To end one is a kindness."
