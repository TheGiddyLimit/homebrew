Issue 1 of {@i ARCADIA} is the first in a three-issue experiment. After issue 3 comes out, we're going to take a break and adjust our strategy to make sure we're delivering on the promise of \"super actionable and really freaking dope.\"",
						"The RPG industry's best authors wrote articles in these first issues that present new rule options, creatures, subclasses, and a whole lot more. In this issue, Willy Abdeel transforms mounted combat with rules for riding owlbears, basilisks, and giant toads, Gabe Hicks grows sorcerers to epic proportions with the Titan Heart subclass, Sadie Lowry cowrites the final act of your campaign with two new celestial big bad options, and Leon Barillaro challenges your players in an adventure where dungeon and villain are one and the same.",
						"Our hope is that you love every word as much as we do, but more important to us is your honest opinion. {@i ARCADIA} is for you, the patrons of MCDM. If we're missing the mark, we want to know! If you really love an article and want to see more like it, we want to know that too! Drop your feedback as comments on Patreon. (Please be kind. There are humans on the other end of your remarks.) Future issues will be shaped by your feedback.",
						"No matter where {@i ARCADIA} goes after this initial experiment, working with the authors, the great folks at MCDM, and an amazing community of playtesters is a true professional privilege. One of the greatest of my career. I'm excited to bring you the work of these designers. Though Matt's name is in the company and my title is managing editor, the writers had the final say over every word in their articles. We made suggestions, but each author's voice, style, and design preferences shine through. {@i ARCADIA} is not a solo act, but a chorus of artists. And we're just getting warmed up.",

										"Uqaviel is a master of controlling the battlefield\u2014and is at an advantage in an arena with level earth and open sky. He begins combat by disabling the most obvious melee threat with his {@i Chakram of the Firmament} and the most obvious ranged threat with his {@i Chakram of the Mantle}. Throughout a fight, he either strategically places his chakrams to keep scattered opponents incapicitated, or devastates grouped foes with Dawn's Fury.",
										"In his exile, Uqaviel has made only a few trusted allies out of other celestials spurned by the heavens. He refuses to ally himself with fiends or other dark forces. If he has not completed his ritual, Uqaviel escapes as quickly as possible (by teleporting or flying away) when a fight is not going in his favor. If his ritual is successfully completed, Uqaviel fights to the death unless his opponents convince him that it's not too late for him to surrender and be restored to his former glory."

										"Anahita is most effective at range, and she avoids engaging enemies on unfavorable terrain. If she picks her arena, it has a high ground she can control; if taken unaware, she immediately seizes the highest point. She opens combat with a Blinding Arrow to disable her foes and strikes as many enemies as possible with a Piercing or Bursting Arrow. As the fight continues, she uses legendary actions to stay out of reach and weakens pressing threats with Blinding Gaze or Enervating Arrow.",
										"If she's acting as a holy archangel, Anahita could be accompanied by {@creature deva||devas} or a {@creature planetar}. If there's no need for deception, she could have several {@creature erinyes} or {@creature horned devil||horned devils} at her service. When it's clear that Anahita can't win an encounter, she attempts to teleport away and turns {@condition invisible} to flee. However, if escape isn't an option, the treacherous archangel is not above striking a deal, promising wealth and power to foes willing to turn to her side."
