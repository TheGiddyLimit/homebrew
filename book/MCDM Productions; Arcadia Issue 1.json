						"The RPG industry's best authors wrote articles in these first issues that present new rule options, creatures, subclasses, and a whole lot more. In this issue, Willy Abdeel transforms mounted combat with rules for riding owlbears, basilisks, and giant toads, Gabe Hicks grows sorcerers to epic proportions with the Titan Heart subclass, Sadie Lowry cowrites the final act of your campaign with two new celestial big bad options, and Leon Barillaro challenges your players in an adventure where dungeon and villain are one and the same.",

There are humans on the other end of your remarks.) Future issues will be shaped by your feedback.",

Though Matt's name is in the company and my title is managing editor, the writers had the final say over every word in their articles. We made suggestions, but each author's voice, style, and design preferences shine through. {@i ARCADIA} is not a solo act, but a chorus of artists. And we're just getting warmed up.",
