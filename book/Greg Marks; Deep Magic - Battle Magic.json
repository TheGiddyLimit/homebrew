						"Any fool can swing a sword. It takes a rare individual to bend the forces of magic to his or her will. Rarer still are those who combine that talent with a study of war. While raining down fire and lightning can decimate an enemy's forces, even more damage can be done to a foe by a well-placed defensive structure, the quick movement of allies, or a curse that impedes the enemy's will to fight. Battle magic is not just about killing your enemy; its true power is in controlling the flow of a conflict so that the spellcaster's allies can seize the moment and win the day."

The raw materials for the spell don't need to be the actual material a siege weapon is normally built from; they just need to be remotely like that and have a value in gold at least equal to the weapon's hit points. (For example, a mangonel has 100 hit points. Instant siege weapon will fashion any collection of raw material worth at least 100 gp into a mangonel, whether that's a small house, three wagons, or two heavy crossbows.) The siege weapon is limited to a maximum size of Large (no siege towers or trebuchets). The spell also creates enough ammunition for ten shots, if the siege engine uses ammunition."
