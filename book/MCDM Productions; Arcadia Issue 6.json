						"Unique villains create memorable stories. Engaging encounters, immersive worlds, and compelling NPCs are all important, but when asked what they remember about campaigns from years past, the first thing many players bring up is that goblin who got away during the first battle, then returned as a dragon-riding sorcerer, and then came back again as a lich for the final encounter. In decades of playing, I've forgotten tavern conversations, tactical battles, NPCs, entire worlds, and even the names and classes of some of my old characters, but I can still tell you almost turn-by-turn about my showdowns with unique villains.",
						"I love playing the game with new players because many of the creatures and tropes experienced gamers take for granted are new to the humans at the table. \"A bugbear? What's that?\" the newbies ask as us GMs giggle with maniacal glee. Every villain that crosses a new player's path is exciting and memorable because of its novelty. Even if greenhorn players know a monster from popular media, like trolls or vampires, they don't know what the game's version of that villain is like, and they have no idea what unique spin the GM will put on the creature. Heck, with new players, us GMs even get to march out old villains and stories we've used before (or borrow them from another GM's game) and these players love to hate these baddies because it's all new to them.",
						"Of course, most of us don't run games for new players every session, especially if we're part of a long-term campaign. And newbies go very quickly from, \"Oh no! What's a kobold?\" to \"Let's run these pipsqueaks over to get to the treasure.\" This is a game about fighting monsters, after all. That means the monsters need to be compelling and there needs to be a lot of them. Villain ideas get used up rather quickly! Each time a GM spends time spinning out a unique villain, that's one more idea that they likely can't use with their group again. After a year of my best brain babies once a week, what can I give my players to surprise them\u2014to say nothing of the friends I started playing with nearly twenty years ago?",
						"To keep my games fresh, I pull villains out of supplements and drop them into my campaign. If I can grab a premade villain with a unique stat block, it saves me time and energy in addition to giving me fresh stuff to put into my game. I might put my own spin on them or smash them together with a second monster to create something new. I don't think there's any published element of the game I use more than villains, and I know other GMs are similar, since monsters have their own book in the core rules! While {@i ARCADIA} featured some cool antagonists in previous issues, the one you're reading now presents the best selection yet.",
						"{@link Michael E. Shea|https://twitter.com/SlyFlourish} provides four new evil characters that form a rival adventuring party to take on the player characters. Each member of the Grim Accord has a deep backstory and unique traits that make them a worthy villain as an individual. Together, this fiercely loyal band is unstoppable\u2014or are they?",
						"{@link Gabe Hicks|https://twitter.com/GabeJamesGames} gives you an entirely different kind of villain in \"Armor of Zevellon.\" An evil demigod of chaos magic bound himself to the pieces of his old armor and returns to life when the set is assembled. Having a villain reveal himself in a mysterious slow burn is my kind of story. The best part about this villain is that the characters might be the ones to summon him in their attempt to gather each piece of the powerful armor.",
						"Finally, {@link H.H. Carlan's|https://twitter.com/stopthtoldwoman} \"Spelunking\" brings us one of the best types of villains: a new legendary creature with lair actions and a tragic backstory. Fawning Summerset doesn't go down easy.",

It's never clear to the members of the Accord whether Irae uses them for her gain or if they use her to get what they desire. So far, at least, the relationship profits them all.",
												"It is said that the blazing soul of the elemental prince of fire touched the halfling when she was a child. Irae's halfling family and village, Willowset, exiled her after her powers manifested in her teenage years and she inadvertently burned down a quarter of the village in a rage-filled inferno. Outcast for six years, she finally returned and finished the job. Willowset's remains still smolder around a pit of molten rock in the center of the village that never cooled. Some say the secret of Irae's power lies within the village's charred ruin. The elf sorcerer Klaroven of the Torch taught Irae to channel her powers, only to try to steal them from the young halfling and leave her a dried husk along with his other students. Irae turned his powers against him and now wears his screaming soul in an amulet around her neck.",
												"The other members of the Accord found Irae nearly destroyed after her battle with Klaroven. The group soon discovered her ability not only for destructive power but for verbal manipulation. It was through Irae's leadership and negotiations that the Grim Accord went from mysterious bandits to profitable adventurers.",

He watched orc warlords send his brothers and sisters into pointless battles and get slaughtered by the hundreds. As a young warrior, Uldun found a like mind in the fabled human mercenary Angus Threefingers. Once an orc hunter himself, Angus saw that orcs were no different than anyone else in the world\u2014a people with their own culture and right for survival. Angus and Uldun became friends, and together they assassinated those who put orcs under the knife. They got very good at it.",

Noting his deadly skills, Athlonia and Kryx liberated him and brought him to their cause. His talents, they explained, were too valuable to end on the blade of an executioner's axe. Later, Irae showed her value to Uldun by bribing and blackmailing those who continued to hunt him. Those who do business with the Grim Accord mostly ignore Uldun's grim past, though veterans of the imperial wars remember the hundreds who fell under his arrows.",

It's extremely hard to catch the Grim Accord unaware. Uldun is as masterful a defensive huntsman as he is an assassin. When he detects someone hunting the Accord, he informs his allies and tracks the trackers. When enemies catch up to the Grim Accord, they often see only two of the four members of the Accord, who are not as unaware as they appear.",

She uses {@spell misty step} to change positions if she gets pinned down. Kryx uses his hyena form for defensive mobility, moving to advantageous positions then reverting to his humanoid form to cast spells like {@spell heat metal} on heavily armored opponents, {@spell blight} on lightly armored foes, or {@spell call lightning} on groups. Athlonia uses her Defensive Shadowstep to defend allies pinned down by enemies. Using this reaction, she can often defend two allies separated across the battlefield. Uldun stays out of sight, using his Cunning Action to hide and hitting defensive spellcasters with longbow attacks.",

Rather than attack the characters directly, the Accord attacks a location their enemies love, often setting it on fire regardless of innocents.

						"Moments before the great paladin Emilia Draeshade thrust her sword into Zevellon's heart, he transferred his life force into the armor. Servants of the Crimson Scorn carried the armor's pieces to different places, hiding them in deep dungeons, and waited for a host worthy of Zevellon.

								"Individual pieces of armor can't be destroyed, but when the armor is united and Zevellon is resurrected by inhabiting the wearer's corpse, the whole suit becomes vulnerable. While Zevellon lives again, a single piece of his armor can be destroyed if it is targeted with a {@spell disintegrate} spell.{@footnote {@sup 1}|{@spell Disintegrate} normally doesn't destroy magic items, but that's why Zevellon made this his armor's weakness. Any spellcaster who knows their craft wouldn't bother wasting a 6th-level spell slot trying to destroy a magic item.} If a single piece of armor is destroyed, it reforms on Zevellon's body {@dice 1d10} days later. If all the pieces of armor are destroyed before a single piece can reform, the suit never reforms.",

										"If a character winds up suddenly possessed by Zevellon, that player may feel betrayed and cheated. While those are appropriate emotions for a character in the situation to have, it's not fun for a player to feel that way. When the characters first find pieces of the armor, you may want to bring a player aside and ask them how they feel about their character becoming a villain. If the player likes the idea, you can have them play the part of Zevellon when the moment is right and turn against their friends. If the player hates the idea, the characters can find books or an NPC that can tell them more about the items. Now the quest isn't to find more pieces of the armor, but to find a way to unattune to the armor, or even attune someone else to the magic armor so it can be destroyed.",
										"Likewise, you can hint to a character that the armor is evil before they assemble all its pieces by having it send telepathic messages to them. If you use this approach, the armor plays the part of a pious magic item most of the time, but it does occasionally try to push the character toward more nefarious action, which is a good sign that it's not what it seems."
