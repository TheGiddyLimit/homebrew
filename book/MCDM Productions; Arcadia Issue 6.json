						"Unique villains create memorable stories. Engaging encounters, immersive worlds, and compelling NPCs are all important, but when asked what they remember about campaigns from years past, the first thing many players bring up is that goblin who got away during the first battle, then returned as a dragon-riding sorcerer, and then came back again as a lich for the final encounter. In decades of playing, I've forgotten tavern conversations, tactical battles, NPCs, entire worlds, and even the names and classes of some of my old characters, but I can still tell you almost turn-by-turn about my showdowns with unique villains.",
						"I love playing the game with new players because many of the creatures and tropes experienced gamers take for granted are new to the humans at the table. \"A bugbear? What's that?\" the newbies ask as us GMs giggle with maniacal glee. Every villain that crosses a new player's path is exciting and memorable because of its novelty. Even if greenhorn players know a monster from popular media, like trolls or vampires, they don't know what the game's version of that villain is like, and they have no idea what unique spin the GM will put on the creature. Heck, with new players, us GMs even get to march out old villains and stories we've used before (or borrow them from another GM's game) and these players love to hate these baddies because it's all new to them.",
						"Of course, most of us don't run games for new players every session, especially if we're part of a long-term campaign. And newbies go very quickly from, \"Oh no! What's a kobold?\" to \"Let's run these pipsqueaks over to get to the treasure.\" This is a game about fighting monsters, after all. That means the monsters need to be compelling and there needs to be a lot of them. Villain ideas get used up rather quickly! Each time a GM spends time spinning out a unique villain, that's one more idea that they likely can't use with their group again. After a year of my best brain babies once a week, what can I give my players to surprise them\u2014to say nothing of the friends I started playing with nearly twenty years ago?",
						"To keep my games fresh, I pull villains out of supplements and drop them into my campaign. If I can grab a premade villain with a unique stat block, it saves me time and energy in addition to giving me fresh stuff to put into my game. I might put my own spin on them or smash them together with a second monster to create something new. I don't think there's any published element of the game I use more than villains, and I know other GMs are similar, since monsters have their own book in the core rules! While {@i ARCADIA} featured some cool antagonists in previous issues, the one you're reading now presents the best selection yet.",
						"{@link Michael E. Shea|https://twitter.com/SlyFlourish} provides four new evil characters that form a rival adventuring party to take on the player characters. Each member of the Grim Accord has a deep backstory and unique traits that make them a worthy villain as an individual. Together, this fiercely loyal band is unstoppable\u2014or are they?",
						"{@link Gabe Hicks|https://twitter.com/GabeJamesGames} gives you an entirely different kind of villain in \"Armor of Zevellon.\" An evil demigod of chaos magic bound himself to the pieces of his old armor and returns to life when the set is assembled. Having a villain reveal himself in a mysterious slow burn is my kind of story. The best part about this villain is that the characters might be the ones to summon him in their attempt to gather each piece of the powerful armor.",

Irae's halfling family and village, Willowset, exiled her after her powers manifested in her teenage years and she inadvertently burned down a quarter of the village in a rage-filled inferno. Outcast for six years, she finally returned and finished the job. Willowset's remains still smolder around a pit of molten rock in the center of the village that never cooled. Some say the secret of Irae's power lies within the village's charred ruin. The elf sorcerer Klaroven of the Torch taught Irae to channel her powers, only to try to steal them from the young halfling and leave her a dried husk along with his other students. Irae turned his powers against him and now wears his screaming soul in an amulet around her neck.",

Kryx uses his hyena form for defensive mobility, moving to advantageous positions then reverting to his humanoid form to cast spells like {@spell heat metal} on heavily armored opponents, {@spell blight} on lightly armored foes, or {@spell call lightning} on groups.

When the pieces are worn together, Zevellon possesses the wearer, turning them into his avatar.",

A few passed suddenly in accidents or battles, most were claimed by old age as time inevitably marched on. The unstoppable force withered all mortals, even long-lived elves like Zevellon. He concluded that death rendered life meaningless. All existence was chaos...unless one could cheat death. There was the answer\u2014immortality was all he needed to bring an end to his fears and give his existence true purpose.",

After displaying the gifts of heightened strength and intelligence he could bestow upon others, warriors and mages came to worship at the feet of the self-declared Crimson Scorn, Demigod of Chaos. These warlocks pledged their fealty and received a piece of the Crimson Scorn's power in exchange. Of course, Zevellon never shared all his gifts with his vassals\u2014 just enough to tempt them.",
						"Zevellon's greatest secret lies within his armor, which contains his very soul. Over the centuries Zevellon lived, he infused his essence bit by bit into the suit. The Crimson Scorn bound the pieces to each other so that, when worn together, the armor would amplify his might.",
						"Moments before the great paladin Emilia Draeshade thrust her sword into Zevellon's heart, he transferred his life force into the armor. Servants of the Crimson Scorn carried the armor's pieces to different places, hiding them in deep dungeons, and waited for a host worthy of Zevellon.
