				"Ophira Pyet was once a disgraced conjuration student living alone in an underground laboratory hidden away in the mountains. Surrounded by failed experiments and scribbled arcane equations her teachers vehemently insisted would never work, Ophira turned in desperation to the very earth she stood on. A few preliminary tests uncovered motes of unique elements hidden in the bedrock, and within a week, Ophira managed to pull massive quantities of these elements to the surface and bind them to planar spirits. She dubbed these creatures {@b nova elementals}: new, carefully refined elemental conjurations with specific and dangerous powers.",
				"A month later, Ophira revealed her discoveries in an explosive display during her university's commencement ceremony, to much surprise and amazement. Professors who previously shunned her now begged Ophira to teach them her methods of elemental conjuration. But no longer beholden to them as a student, Ophira refused. A few more persistent mages attempted to reverse engineer her process, but they soon realized that without Ophira's precise calculations at hand, these nova elementals would become wild and stubborn, disobeying commands and quickly turning against their summoners.",
				"Ophira would go on to publish her findings about elemental magic, though her exact means of exerting perfect control over the nova elementals would always remain her closely guarded secret. Some elemental mages have figured out alternate means for semi-stabilizing summoned nova elementals, but the practice is generally regarded as a brazen and foolish use of magic."

						"Watching ARCADIA artists bring the authors' creations to life is one of the best parts of my job. Last issue delivered fantastic mounts, titanic sorcerers, fallen angels, a beautiful harpy cover, and an adventure visualized by the best in the business. This issue brings you more of our artists' remarkable work, as I'm sure you could see from our awesome cover, this time by Ejiwa \"Edge\" Ebenebe.",
						"From the pitch phase of each issue, ARCADIA aims to bring you innovative and actionable fifth edition content from top creators in RPGs. That doesn't just mean story and mechanics. The art in each issue, from the cover to each quarter-page diagram, is just as important to us as the words. Reading Makenzie De Armas's description of a noxa floods the mind with wonderful, alien imagery and possibilities. Without the time and words to describe every single visual detail of the creature, what you picture when you read is likely different than what I imagine. But when Makenzie's evocative description is placed alongside Grace Cheung's illustration of the new elemental, we get two incredible results.",
						"First, we now have a shared idea and standard of what this creature looks like. That's essential for any tabletop RPG. It's why so many players love sharing art of their characters. They want everyone else at the table to picture their hero as they do. For decades GMs have handed out maps and diagrams and held up illustrations to give their players a better idea of how the characters can interact with the story. We aim to give you as much art to play with as we can in ARCADIA.",
						"While quantity is one driving factor for us, more important is quality. RPG art should do more than bring imaginations together. It should make your mind run wild. A good illustration of a monster shows the players what the creature looks like. A great illustration thrills them as they imagine not just what the monster is but what it can be and what it will do. The best RPG design gives you ideas for epic storytelling possibilities. It makes you contact your friends immediately to set up a time to game so you can use that content. Art is no different. The visuals in ARCADIA don't just show you something\u2014they make you wonder what else could be. A lot of that is thanks to the amazing art team at MCDM.",
						"I've learned more about art in the few months I've been working on ARCADIA than I did my entire life before. Executive Art Director Jason Hasenauer and Artist & Outsource Manager Nick De Spain (whose mounts you saw in issue 1) thoughtfully curate each piece. They look over the articles and art suggestions from the authors, myself, and Head of Production Anna Coulter, and select the artists who fit each job. Often that person is Grace Cheung, MCDM's beyond-talented In-House Artist. Other times it is the work of Marlowe Lune, as you'll see in \"Subclasses of the Seasons,\" Diana Muñoz, whose maps appear in \"Well of the Lost Gods,\" or any number of incredible folks we have collaborated with or will in future issues. When all the art is complete, Jen McCleary, one of the most creative graphic and layout designers I've ever worked with, brings it all together into an evocative magazine. I really hope you enjoy digging in as much as we did making it.",

						"The desolation of winter, the rebirth of spring, the relentlessness of summer, and the isolation of fall. Some practitioners of the arcane arts gain power from the natural patterns each season exhibits. Going beyond weather phenomena or base elements, these mages delve fully into the nature of the world as it is influenced by a season, taking power from the essence of each perennial force.",

While their numbers may be few and their practitioners scattered, their ranks will always replenish, just as the seasons continue to turn. In this article you will find four subclasses, one each for the bard, sorcerer, wizard, and warlock, each themed after one of the four seasons.",

Something elemental, barely holding its form together.",

						"Contrary to popular belief, air, fire, earth, and water are not the only elements in the universe. They just happen to be the most stable of the elementals, the easiest for individuals to summon and control through arcane means. But more reckless mages, through complex study, can conjure fearsome creatures made from other elements. Lithium, argon, magnesium\u2014such elementals are extremely dangerous and rarely obedient to their summoner. But for those able to harness such creatures, the power these elementals wield is beyond even the keenest conjurer's imagination.",
						"This article presents four new elemental creatures that draw inspiration from the real-life periodic table. These new elementals provide fresh combat options for any adventurers tired of fighting the same elemental monsters again and again (not to mention the GMs tired of running them). Also included are alternate rules for encounters with different types of elementals that explore how elements may react with one another to create even more volatile chaos on the battlefield.",

								"Ophira Pyet was once a disgraced conjuration student living alone in an underground laboratory hidden away in the mountains. Surrounded by failed experiments and scribbled arcane equations her teachers vehemently insisted would never work, Ophira turned in desperation to the very earth she stood on. A few preliminary tests uncovered motes of unique elements hidden in the bedrock, and within a week, Ophira managed to pull massive quantities of these elements to the surface and bind them to planar spirits. She dubbed these creatures {@b nova elementals}: new, carefully refined elemental conjurations with specific and dangerous powers.",
								"A month later, Ophira revealed her discoveries in an explosive display during her university's commencement ceremony, to much surprise and amazement. Professors who previously shunned her now begged Ophira to teach them her methods of elemental conjuration. But no longer beholden to them as a student, Ophira refused. A few more persistent mages attempted to reverse engineer her process, but they soon realized that without Ophira's precise calculations at hand, these nova elementals would become wild and stubborn, disobeying commands and quickly turning against their summoners.",
								"Ophira would go on to publish her findings about elemental magic, though her exact means of exerting perfect control over the nova elementals would always remain her closely guarded secret. Some elemental mages have figured out alternate means for semi-stabilizing summoned nova elementals, but the practice is generally regarded as a brazen and foolish use of magic.",
