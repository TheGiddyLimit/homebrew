						"The Pevic Continent is a land situated on the world of Gol, a sphere floating amongst several other vibrant world connected by a cosmic web. It is a land steeped in history and featuring a variety of cultures and societies.",
						"It currently is in the midst of a renaissance after hundreds of years of darkness following a terrible catastrophe that led to magic being made rare and unusual. Prior to the catastrophe magic was ubiquitous across cities and towns, and virtually every citizen had access to basic cantrips and common magical items that kept the wheels of civilisation turning. Without magic, the world entered a dark age. Cities splintered and old nations crumbled into isolated city states and tribes.",
						"What little magic was left became the stuff of fairytales and folklore. Hidden groves where magic still thrived were hidden away in nature, tended to by the few druids and {@class ranger|PHB|rangers} that were left in the world. {@class wizard|phb|Wizards} became a rare elite, and even the gods themselves could not escape the magical calamity. All were weakened, many disappeared entirely, and the few that were left had survived only by merging their portfolios together to safeguard civilisation.",
						"This devastating fall of magic led to the rise of new technologies. Ways of working metal and stone had to be developed once again, and currently the continent is comfortable in their use of bronze and iron. To the West, the newly formed {@book Aegan Empire|BITCEH|1|The Aegan Empire} has revived the manufacture of steel, and it seems that the dark ages are near a close.",
						"War yet persists in the East, where dozens of city states vie for power. Instability creates opportunity, though. Several of the largest of them have risen up above the weaker cities in power. In the centre of the continent the valley of Kathkacha rolls in wealth from their mercantile deals with both the {@book Aegan Empire|BITCEH|1|The Aegan Empire} and the {@book Eastern City States|BITCEH|1|The Eastern City States}. To the north, the {@book Northern Kingdoms|BITCEH|1|The Northern Kingdoms} benefit greatly from weakness in the south securing their borders. Lastly, the fearsome {@book Helviti|BITCEH|3|Helviti Comanda} sell their services as deadly soldiers to the highest bidder and maintain order within the civilised regions.",
						"It is a time where conflict and opportunity exist in equal supply. More than a few adventurers would throw themselves into these tumultuous times in search of gold and power. Others would hunt for the rare fragments of magic left in the world, as even something as simple as an ancient enchanted sword would give them a distinct edge. Others hunt down emerging instances of the supernatural that hide in the darkest corners of the world, hidden away from the watchful eyes of civilisation.",

								"The continent itself has a long history, but before the collapse of magic only a small amount is known. Many ancient texts were lost following the collapse of the magic age, and what remains is found largely in the memories of the {@race elf|phb|elves} who were still alive in that period.",
								"Before the collapse, there were many cities ruled by the most powerful wizard and priest class. Some were ruled well, whilst others were brutal dictatorships. There was also a massive variety of religion, featuring many deities familiar to other worlds, such as Tyr and Eredus, as well as gods native to the world of Gol, such as Aepoptosis, the primal god of violence, and Ukua, the goddess of civilisation.",
								"In this time the {@book Aegan Empire|BITCEH|1|The Aegan Empire} did not exist, nor did the {@book Northern Kingdoms|BITCEH|1|The Northern Kingdoms} as we know them today. Some cities stood in this time, such as Kathkach, the largest city in the {@book Kathkacha region|BITCEH|1|Kathkacha}, as well as Grandstar, known in this age as Virilian by the {@race elf|phb|elves} who lived there.",
								"Each city ruled itself, with a powerful spellcaster at its head, be it a divine spellcaster such as a high priest or an arcane spellcaster such as an {@creature archmage}.",
								"The collapse occurred roughly five-hundred years ago. Cities like Kathkacha were abandoned in the chaos, and were only reclaimed later as the panic and terror subsided. Organisations formed to grant security to the people; most notable of these were the powerful {@book Aegan Empire|BITCEH|1|The Aegan Empire} and the decentralised {@book Northern Kingdoms|BITCEH|1|The Northern Kingdoms}. The Kathkacha valley was resettled by {@book Brasshand the Bold|BITCPI|8|Brasshand the Bold} after it abandoned its bloody ways worshipping the primal god of violence, Aepoptosis. {@book The Eastern City States|BITCEH|1|The Eastern City States} built themselves on the bones of the ancient mage-cities. Magic faded from prominence overnight, and in its place mercantilism and military might rose into newfound favour.",
								"Plunged into a technological dark age, many of the new civilisations were sent back into a proverbial stone age. Technology did not advance equally across all of the continent. The {@book Aegan Empire|BITCEH|1|The Aegan Empire}, racing to reclaim ancient texts and technologies, flourished and has begun introducing steel back into their armies. The rest of the world remains more comfortable with bronze and iron."

It built itself along the western coast of the continent, and it spans from the {@book inhospitable jungles|BITCPI|7|The Untamed Jungles} to the south all the way up to a mountainous border with the {@book Northern Kingdoms|BITCEH|1|The Northern Kingdoms}.",
								"Above all else, the Aegan Empire is obsessed with power. They are a military powerhouse, their martial prowess matched only by the {@book Helviti|BITCEH|3|Helviti Comanda}, but with the added advantage of size, a stronger and more reliable economy, and a prestigious navy. If left unchecked they might have invaded towards the centre of the continent, taking over {@book Kathkacha|BITCEH|1|Kathkacha} and penetrating into the {@book Eastern City States region|BITCEH|1|The Eastern City States}, and forming an Empire that spanned the width of the entire continent.",
								"Their expanse was halted, however, as they found an enemy they never expected. Ships sent West, designed to explore the various islands and potentially discover new lands in the form of distant continents, returned as enemies. The seamen aboard their ships were driven mad, their bodies bearing signs of self-mutilation, and wreaked havoc across the Aegan coastline and island forts. More worrisome still were the ships they had {@i not} sent West that followed them. Ramshackle rafts carrying men and women of equal insanity, armed with crude but brutal weapons. They attacked with no mercy nor predictability, whooping and hollering as they disembarked upon the vulnerable shores. They killed and tormented without remorse, and this sudden string of attacks put the Aegan Empire on the defensive.",
								"Their focus became the formation of a deadly fleet and fortifying their coastal forts against attack. Never again would they allow themselves to be made vulnerable from the sea. The Aegan Fleet became the greatest in the world, but at the same time any hopes of conquest of the continent were dashed by the relentless naval attacks. To make matters worse, in a poorly judged moment of arrogance, their largest land army was devastated at the infamous {@book Battle of Looming Rock|BITCEH|1|The Battle at Looming Rock}. The formation of a fleet required coin and resources, and trade with the {@book East|BITCEH|1|The Eastern City States} provided both. Never again would the Aegan Empire pose a serious threat to the lands to the {@book East|BITCEH|1|The Eastern City States}.",
								"The fear of attack from the sea allowed a powerful faction within the Aegan Empire to form: the {@book Steelmongers|BITCEH|2|Steelmongers}. This group pushed for the reclaiming of ancient arcane technology, and focussed much of their resources on advancing the military might of the Aegan Empire. Under their rule, the Aegan Empire became technologically advanced compared to the other nations in the Continent. Steel tips their magnificent {@object ballista} bolts, their {@vehicle warship|GoS|Warships} are twice the size of any other in the world, and magnificently engineered stone citadels dot the coast.",
								"In order to secure their rule, they entered into an alliance with the {@book Helviti Comanda|BITCEH|3|Helviti Comanda} in order to boost their control over the region. As regular additions to their army, they have acquired the services of {@book Devil Comanda, Lion Comanda, and Kraken Comanda|BITCEH|3|Helviti Comanda|1}.",

This war saw the {@book Northern Kingdoms|BITCEH|1|The Northern Kingdoms} as victors. After many years roaming the seas, the Empire was ill-prepared for a ground war against the rough barbaric tactics of the north, and their forces were decimated at the disaster that was the {@book Battle of Looming Rock|BITCEH|1|The Battle at Looming Rock} which saw them enter into conflict with their {@book Helviti|BITCEH|3|Helviti Comanda} allies.

Except the devil vampire crabs. Nothing stops the devil vampire crabs. The only habitable spots (relatively speaking) are a small number of oases that dot the landscape. These oases are home to the most dangerous civilisation in terms of raw fighting prowess: the Helviti.",

They are largely organised into groups known as {@book Comanda|BITCEH|3|Helviti Comanda}, which operate like clans, or a mercenary company. Each {@book Comanda|BITCEH|3|Helviti Comanda} has a name, and famous Comanda are legendary across the Continent. Among them are the {@book Cobalt Comanda|BITCPI|4|Cobalt Comanda}, Titanium Comanda, and the Vanguard Comanda, but there are hundreds of smaller groups throughout the world.",
								"Despite the dangers of the wastes, which include dehydration, disorientation, and digestion in the stomach of the vicious giant sandsquids, {@creature Winged Spider|BloodInTheCompany|winged spiders}, and bugcats, the Helviti Wastes are the fastest and most direct path between the {@book Eastern City States|BITCEH|1|The Eastern City States}, Kathkacha, the {@book Aegan Empire|BITCEH|1|The Aegan Empire} and the {@book Northern Kingdoms|BITCEH|1|The Northern Kingdoms} that doesn't involve marching over unforgiving and treacherous mountain ranges or sailing around the coast.

										"The Helviti Wastelanders don't have many defining battles due to their disparate clan-like nature. For this reason, the Battle of Looming Rock, also known as the battle of the Five Comanda, stands out. Serving the {@book Aegan Empire|BITCEH|1|The Aegan Empire}, the Lion Comanda and the Devil Comanda both marched against an army from the {@book Northern Kingdoms|BITCEH|1|The Northern Kingdoms} alongside an Aegan force. Sensing imminent victory, the {@book Aegan Empire|BITCEH|1|The Aegan Empire} rescinded their contract with the Helviti just prior to the final battle at Looming Rock.",
										"In order to protect their reputation and prevent similar breaches in contract from other nations, Lion and Devil Comanda both sent a call to the Topaz, Horsehair, and Whistle Comanda who were in the region. Through deft manoeuvering and sudden surprise, they were able to annihilate a full half of the Aegan force, though this came at the cost of the Lion Comanda.",
										"Sensing defeat and dreading the complete loss of the Aegan army, the Aegan Commander at the time quickly ordered the Helviti to be paid in full. Through quick communication and expert coordination, the Helviti switched sides once again and cornered the {@book Northern Kingdoms|BITCEH|1|The Northern Kingdoms} army, unaware of the turmoil between the Helviti and the Aegan armies.",
										"The battle ended as a pyrrhic victory for the Aegan forces, who had lost such a substantial portion of their forces to Helviti harrying from the Horsehair and Whistle Comanda that their aspirations to march on the {@book Northern Kingdoms|BITCEH|1|The Northern Kingdoms} were irreparably halted. The Helviti had cemented their reputation as a force not to be crossed. The Devil Comanda continues to serve the {@book Aegan Empire|BITCEH|1|The Aegan Empire}, who relies heavily on their service and continues to pay them handsomely to this day."

								"In exchange for safe passage, they would tax merchants passing through their nation. They secured their borders well and guard against smugglers and bandits, and by taming the few paths through the deadly wastes they monopolised trade through their rugged homeland.",
								"Taking this mentality of using their martial skills for profit, many of their Comanda export themselves to the rest of the world as mercenaries. A Helviti Comanda is often able to defeat armies much larger than itself in size due to their lifelong commitment to battle and violence and highly specialised set of skills, and so are often bought as guards in the {@book Aegan Empire|BITCEH|1|The Aegan Empire}, {@book Kathkacha|BITCEH|1|Kathkacha}, and wealthier members of the {@book Eastern City States|BITCEH|1|The Eastern City States}. Kraken Comanda sails the seas alongside the Aegans to protect against the maddened sea-people, {@book Cobalt Comanda|BITCPI|4|Cobalt Comanda} guards the {@book Brass Palace|BITCPI|5|The Brass Palace} in Kathkach, and Wendigo Comanda spreads itself far and wide, individual members sending back their earnings to the homeland.",
								"Each Comanda follows a strict and complex code that involves not taking any action that would harm the homeland. They are even permitted to fight one another if so doing brings profit to the homeland and does not endanger their security at home.",
								"The image abroad of the Helviti is therefore one of violent barbarians and professional killers. At home, the truth is more nuanced. The towns around the oases are filled with civilians and even artists. These people are rougher than most due to their environment, but nonetheless it can be surprising for many outsiders to see this softer side of the Helviti Comanda.",
								"To a Helviti, one is only considered an adult if one joins and proves themselves to a Comanda. An adult is given a suit of armour to protect themselves, and these armours can vary in origin and type. Some are made abroad, some are passed down generations, and some are built to order for the individual Helviti. As there is a lack of resources in the Wastes, this results in a patchwork look to most warriors from this region. Children work in the Wastes to maintain food supplies, tend to homes, and other less violent tasks. They are offered protection by the powerful Comanda, though this protection is retracted if they leave the Wastes and cease contributing to their society.",
								"Also present in the Wastes are nomadic tribes that follow oral traditions. These groups live in harmony with the more civilised Comanda and often work alongside them during travels through the Wastes. These nomadic groups remember the times before the collapse, and train to hunt down magic and harness it through martial arts. These nomadic groups form the basis of many monastic orders, such as the influential Helviti Inquisition. Martial arts across the continent mostly stems from these nomadic tribes.",
								"Depending on what Comanda one might encounter, one's experience of the Helviti could be radically different. Whereas the {@book Chimera Comanda|BITCPI|4|Chimera Comanda} focus on cruelty, for instance, Gold Comanda are well reputed for their noble disposition.",

They have been at peace for many years, with only small skirmishes against some {@book Eastern City States|BITCEH|1|The Eastern City States} trying to march over the mountains into their land and one war against the {@book Aegan Empire|BITCEH|1|The Aegan Empire} that resulted in a win for the fearsome northern warriors.",

In the hilly, grassy terrain they live in, they have plenty of cover to conceal themselves in and are far more mobile than large, slow columns that the {@book Aegan Empire|BITCEH|1|The Aegan Empire} prefers.",

Art is encouraged, as is literature, and stories of heroic warriors and lovestruck paladins are sung by {@class bard|PHB|bards} across the land.

Hats are often worn, similarly adorned. Beards and hair alike are braided. Orcs and half-orcs will frequently plate their tusks with bronze or gold, and species like elves or gnomes who live there may adorn their ears with any number of earrings and piercings. In Kathkacha, even weapons are accessories, and the wealthy may carry decorative items like khopeshes, handaxes, and daggers at the waist. In Kathkacha, beards and hair alike are braided into coils, often held in place with bronze rings. As for the common dress, sandals are worn, though they are soled with softwood and multiple layers of leather, rather than wood."

						"Though coveted, many magical artifacts, such as enchanted blades, amulets, and trinkets, are often stored in vaults when they are considered too dangerous to control or leave available to the public. As a result of these factors, magic in the world of Gol is rare and oftentimes frightening to the commoners. Use with caution!",
