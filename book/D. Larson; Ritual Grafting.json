						"The desire to modify and alter one's body is a popular notion in many fantasy and sci-fi rpg worlds, and with the reintroduction of {@book Eberron: Rising from the Last War|ERLW} in 5e, I noticed the lack of grafts and decided to try my hand at converting them myself!",
						"The idea of the magical grafting system is that a person has the ability (as long as they take the proper feat) to take a portion of an existing, willing creature, and transplant it onto their own body, or the body of another creature, to modify it in such a way that it provides some sort of bonus or ability.",
						"The idea of grafting is frowned upon in some societies, and certainly isn't cheap, but as technology progresses and time passes, the dangers of the grafting process have been significantly lessened.",
						"The grafting process comes with a certain set of rules that cannot be broken:",
						{
							"type": "list",
							"items": [
								"{@b Grafts can only be created and applied by someone who has taken the appropriate feat.} Unlike the creation of magical items, which is similar in theory, the creator of grafts must be able to very delicately manipulate bio energy on a minute scale. The following feats allow a player to work with such magics: {@i {@optfeature Deathless Fleshgrafter|DLRG}}, {@i {@optfeature Eldeen Plantgrafter|DLRG}} and {@i {@optfeature Elemental Grafter|DLRG}}.",
								"{@b An individual may only have a total of five grafts grown on their body, and all such grafts have to be of the same type.} Much like a player can only attune to so many magical items, a body can only handle so much augmentation before it's overwhelmed by the biomagical signals, which often leads to madness, and sometimes death. No part of the body (head, legs, skin, flesh, and arms) can support more than one graft, and no individual can have grafts of two different types (deathless, elemental, or plant).",
								"{@b Using a graft requires sacrifice from the host to be successful.} Grafts take a toll on the body of the host, and in most cases it only applies a slight negative to the host's hit point total. Some of the harder to apply grafts have a heavier cost, such as permanent ability score reduction, or causing permanent disadvantage on certain saves or checks. These costs cannot be bypassed while the graft is being worn, and grafts can only be removed by the same individuals capable of applying them.",
								"{@b All grafts must come from a donor creature, or from tissues taken from one or more in a laboratory setting.} If taken from a donor, the given tissue must be no more than seven days old at the time of application on the host.",
								"{@b Grafts can be difficult to remove.} Grafts have no statistics of their own, and cannot be targeted or damaged separately from the creature to which they are grafted. A character with the appropriate feat can remove a graft safely, but it requires 8 hours of work in a quiet setting. Without the proper feat, a graft can only be removed by removing the part of the body to which it is attached, but a graft removed in this manner dies immediately. Likewise, if a character with a graft is killed, the graft dies with them.",
								"{@b A graft is not a magical item.} It does not give off magical energy once completed (although the creation of a graft may require spells in its construction), and it does not take up a body slot like a magical item would. A graft is not affected by spells such as dispel magic or antimagic field."

								"Similar to removing a graft, creating one also requires 8 hours of work in a quiet, comfortable setting, and a supply of materials (including the donated tissue). The cost of material supplies is included in the creation cost of the graft.",
								"Otherwise, creating a graft is very similar to crafting an item of magical quality, including the costs to create, the time required, preparation of spells, and expenditure of components. Unlike some magical items, grafts need not be crafted over multiple days- a crafter may spend a day here and there to tend a lab-grown tissue graft, but it won't be functional until the total required amount of time has been spent on it. In addition, the character cannot spend more than a week in between the days spent working on the incomplete graft, or it will die, and the character will lose a portion of the gp cost involved in the graft's creation equal to the amount of time spent on it before it died.",
								"A character must spend 8 hours on the grafting process on each day that he works on the graft. Failure to do so does not result in lost components or gold, but the day's work is wasted.",

						"The art of grafting the flesh of an undying onto a worthy elven hero has long been a part of Aerenal Elven culture, and they are the only known group on Eberron to have mastered the craft until very recently.",

The advantage bonus granted to History, Religion, and Nature checks regarding the past can be used as a free action.",
								"{@b Effect.} When the deathless visage graft is activated, you can fix your glare upon a single creature within 30 feet that can see you (and be seen by you). This effect is similar to a gaze attack used actively, but it does not affect creatures on their turns as a gaze attack can.",
								"The creature you target becomes frightened unless they succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC 8 + Proficiency + Cha modifier). Even if they succeed on the saving throw, they are still affected- this is a mind-affecting ability. For one round, the creature has disadvantage on all attack rolls, ability checks, saving throws, and skill checks.",

The drawback to this graft is the heavy psychological burden it places upon your mind and soul, making you somewhat less socially capable. You have disadvantage on all Bluff, Diplomacy, Insight, and Intimidate checks made against any other creature other than another Aereni elf or a deathless creature.",
