				"You gain the service of a familiar, a spirit that takes a special form you choose: a gelatinous cubelet, gorgonette, imp, miniature xorn, pseudodragon, quasit, sprite, toy golem, or unicorn foal. Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the familiar has the statistics of the chosen form.",
				"Your familiar acts independently of you, but it always obeys your commands. In combat, it rolls its own initiative and acts on its own turn. A familiar normally can't attack, but when you take the attack action, you can forgo one of your own attacks to allow your familiar to make one attack with its reaction. The familiar can take other actions as normal.",
				"When the familiar drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind no physical form. It reappears after you cast this spell again.",
				"While your familiar is within 100 feet of you, you can communicate with it telepathically. Additionally, as an action, you can see through your familiar's eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn, gaining the benefits of any special senses that the familiar has. During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses.",
				"As an action, you can temporarily dismiss your familiar. It disappears into a pocket dimension where it awaits your summons. Alternatively, you can dismiss it forever. As an action while it is temporarily dismissed, you can cause it to reappear in any unoccupied space within 30 feet of you. Additionally, if your familiar is hit with an attack or makes a saving throw to avoid taking damage, you can use a reaction to temporarily dismiss your familiar, which disappears before taking damage or suffering any other effects of the attack or triggering effect.",
				"You can't have more than one familiar at a time. If you cast this spell while you already have a familiar, you instead cause it to adopt a new form. Choose one of the forms from the above list. Your familiar transforms into the chosen creature.",
				"Finally, when you cast a spell with a range of touch, your familiar can deliver the spell as if it had cast the spell. Your familiar must be within 100 feet of you, and it must use its reaction to deliver the spell when you cast it. If the spell requires an attack roll, you use your attack modifier for the roll."

On a failure, the creature takes 7 ({@damage 2d6}) acid damage and can't retrieve the object. On a success, the creature still takes the damage, but successfully removes the object.

						"Playtesting made this issue (and every previous issue of {@i ARCADIA}) awesome. If you like what you read in this magazine, please join me in thanking our invaluable testers and Lars Bakke, the Production and Playtest Director for {@i ARCADIA} and MCDM Productions.",
						"When I first started working with MCDM as a contractor, I was delighted to learn they had a full-time staff member overseeing playtesting. Every tabletop company I've worked with runs playtests a little differently, and none put as much care or as many rounds of testing into the process as MCDM. It's one reason I wanted to join the team full-time!",
						"For {@i ARCADIA}, I go through my own suggested revisions with the authors, and then each article goes through two rounds of development testing. In the first round, a dedicated team of paid playtesters gives initial feedback on the article. I read their comments and summarize them for the author. Then the writer takes that feedback and makes any revisions they deem necessary. (It is their name on the byline, after all, so they get final say!) Round two is similar to round one, except that the article is playtested by a bigger group of volunteer testers (which also includes the contractors from round one).",
						"Since {@i ARCADIA} is a monthly magazine, we're doing this process at least three times a month alongside everything else we test, like content for {@class Illrigger|ILL|The Illrigger} or {@book Kingdoms & Warfare|KaW} (which have much longer development cycles and many rounds of testing, including public playtests). After going through two rounds of playtesting and revision, the articles head off to final edit, where {@link Sadie Lowry|https://twitter.com/incandescaent} and {@link Hannah Rose|https://twitter.com/wildrosemage} perform incredible feats of language arts...and language maths. Once they've done their thing, {@link Jen McCleary|https://www.jenmccleary.com/} takes the words from the development side and the illustrations from our art team and lays it all out into a magazine...that goes back into playtesting.",
						"The MCDM staff and our contract testers go through another few rounds of proofreading the layout to catch typos and other errors, which we report to Jen, who fixes them. Then we send the InDesign files to {@link Chris Hopper|https://twitter.com/chrishopper2}, who makes the articles accessible and tackles any very lastminute fixes we ask.",
						"After all that, you get the magazine, but testing still ain't done! Our senior tester, {@link Spencer Hibnick|https://twitter.com/PestoEnthusiast}, reads the community's reactions and compiles any new issues found after publishing, because someday we may do an updated compilation!",
						"I've never been part of a team that tests this thoroughly. It is a huge boon that pays off in spades. Our authors love it, and {@i ARCADIA} is better for it. I know I'm grateful.",
						"So when you're watching your players' faces light up as they use one of {@link Scott Fitzgerald Gray's|https://twitter.com/scottfgray} magic weapons, create a custom familiar using {@link Celeste Conowitch's|https://twitter.com/cconowitch} method, or wreak havoc as a goblin in {@link Anthony Joyce's|https://twitter.com/Thrawn589} adventure, join me in giving a hearty thanks to the entire team who makes {@i ARCADIA} awesome.",

Because traits are challenging to design from scratch, look at creature stat blocks similar to the familiar you are creating and borrow traits for your own monstrous creations. Traits tend to vary widely in power, so you must choose traits that low-challenge rating creatures typically have. For example, giving your familiar a {@creature planetar||planetar's} Innate Spellcasting trait would make it too powerful to be a familiar, but giving it something like an {@creature owl||owl's} Flyby trait makes sense.",

Fragments of lore whisper that these mighty weapons, the Arms of Accord, were not crafted by those ancient peoples, but rather were created by benefactors unknown, whose goal was to bind these great lines in accord and allegiance.",
						"At great summits called the Quorum of Sovereigns, hundreds of representatives of the ever-growing humanoid nations would meet to share news and stories, discoveries and portents.

The last Quorum of Sovereigns was held over ten millennia ago, and the fragmentary lore of those days suggest that representatives of only two of the humanoid peoples were in attendance, with other nations already falling to strife and warfare.

For example, a {@creature chonka|Arcadia10} gobbo might make a Strength ({@skill Performance}) check as it shows off by flexing its muscles while dancing. Two creatures can choose to partner with each other if they are within 5 feet of each other, in which case the creature with the highest modifier makes the ability check with advantage, a reflection of the beauty of two creatures dancing salsa together.
