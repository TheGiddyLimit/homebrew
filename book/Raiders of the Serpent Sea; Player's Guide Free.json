						"Welcome to the {@i Player's Guide to Raiders of the Serpent Sea}. This guide will provide you with all the tools you need to run a campaign in the primal lands of Grimnir.",
						"{@i Raiders of the Serpent Sea} is strongly influenced by Norse mythology and the histories of the Vikings. Many tales from ancient sources, as well as more recent depictions in popular media, have inspired this campaign. Yet, this world is not our world. Thor and Odin do not wander the lands, nor will your party sit at a feasting hall across from Ragnar Lodbrok, Erik the Red, or Cnut the Great.",
						"This is a fantasy world where you will encounter peoples, creatures, and gods that will be familiar to those who admire Norse mythology. But this world is a blend of high fantasy and what we imagine a darker world of grim seafaring raiders might look like. It is a new world, birthed by the destruction of a much older civilization. Creatures from our prehistoric past the saber-toothed tiger, bears the size of longships, and vast herds of mammoth coexist with fantastic sea serpents, grim giants, illusive dragons, and the world devourers, the Yoten. The raiding peoples of Grimnir live amongst these creatures in the unstable, primal world they all inhabit. No stretch of land, of forest, of sea is entirely safe.",
						"In your hands, your party will live the life of glory seeking Vikings. Their deeds may become the sagas of future generations, and if they live well and boldly (and survive) they may even become something akin to the gods and goddesses from those old stories and myths. Regardless, though their fate may seem determined, their actions and yours as gamemaster shall decide whether this world meets the fate of the one that came before it or if Grimnir finally breaks free from the eternal cycle we call Ragnarök."

								"The stories of Vikings have always lived large in our imaginations and there are as many flavors of these stories as there are storytellers. We imagine that these seafaring raiders lived as large in their world as they do in our stories; that they were boastful in the face of danger and took tremendous risks to secure their fortunes, fates, and place in history.",
								"I have long been enamored with these people who sailed the seas of the hardy north. My initial interest perhaps stemmed from a different source than many others. It was a volcanic island that brought me to the Vikings. Surtsey surfaced in the 60s, south of Iceland in the Vestmannaeyjar archipelago. The idea that in our time (with the geography of the world feeling so static and unchanging to me) new masses of land might be created... that parts of the world could be formed before our eyes, was beyond fascinating. I began devouring the sagas, legends, and myths of Iceland and even wrote a few fantasy stories set in a mythical world inspired in part by what I learned. This was a long time ago!",
								"A couple years past, I was finally able to travel to Iceland and explore it myself and though I never made it to Surtsey, I did stay on the island Heimaey. The rough, wave-tossed journey made me aware that I would be a rather pathetic Viking, but I was immediately enamored with that rugged, windy place! It was perhaps there that I first began to think about this book, specifically.",
								"Vikings are much beloved, from the early stories and myths, to their depictions in popular comics, and even to the (somewhat) more historically accurate shows streaming across all the popular platforms. We know a lot about them but there are also gaps in our knowledge: room enough for our imaginations to fill. It is only natural that the core themes exploration, bravery, sacrifice, and fate become the backbone of a roleplaying fantasy campaign.",
								"It has been an exciting journey so far to build this fantasy world for the 5th edition of the world's greatest roleplaying game. Grimnir has many layers its core is set in the early myths of the Vikings, but it is also heavily inspired by all the various ways we have come to admire these peoples. There are even pieces of my own stories written and published over the decades and my earlier campaigns to be found herein."

						"Inspired by the stories told of Viking seafarers, and the myths and narratives important to those explorers, this book will help you build a rich Viking-themed world. Set in Grimnir, a world born from the destruction of the {@i Lost Lands}, the raiding clans compete against and exploit one another in their drive to survive amidst many deadly perils.",
						"The campaign is designed for the 5th Edition of the world's greatest roleplaying game. It starts with 4-6 heroes of 1st level and will take them on a journey across storm tossed seas, through haunted forests, ancient ruins, and into lands never explored by the living, as they journey to 10th level or higher. While sailing the Serpent Sea they may witness vast herds of furred beasts stampeding along icy coastlines, volcanoes rising unexpectedly to birth new islands before their eyes, or inland forests quivering and shaking as giants prepare raiding parties of their own.",
						"Raiders of the Serpent Sea has a primary epic narrative divided into four main acts but with numerous opportunities for players to build longships, conquer settlements, and even assemble their own clan to stand against their foes at the end of the world.",
						"In the beginning, a fate rune is cast by the raider seers (known as the völv) for every soul braving the world of Grimnir. Each hero must embrace that fate to save this world during the inevitable final battle even if the sacrifices they must make are cruel, unfair, and devastating. Heroes in Grimnir persevere against overwhelming odds and devastating setbacks. Only the bold shall succeed.",
						"And yet... even if the world is saved, {@i how} the heroes save it forever alters the future.",

										"Centuries ago, upon a vast, beautiful, and wondrous world, a horde of shape changing fiends known as the Yoten warred with the heroic Vanir. The Yoten's leader, Boða, used might and treachery to force her way across those fabled lands till the Vanir were left defending a single settlement. All that remained of their culture and people made their stand within that walled city.",
										"At Boða's side stood Mirgal, whose earlier betrayals had already weakened his former Vanir allies. In exchange for the power Boða offered, Mirgal had become her consort and the architect of the Lost Land's utter destruction. At the bloody climax of the battle Mirgal's own creations a feral wolf the size of a longship, a sinewy serpent capable of disintegrating opponents with her poison, and many others joined the fray. Scores perished against these hordes as the beasts clambered over city walls and slaughtered innocents.",

										"Seeing the inevitable, Aldyhn (the leader of the Vanir, and niece to Mirgal himself) surged through the enemy lines and challenged her uncle. They fought furiously but Aldyhn's sword arm was powered by her devotion to her people and she overwhelmed Mirgal. But his death was not enough to turn the battle as the Yoten swarmed, like locusts, around her. The end was inevitable.",
										"So Aldyhn did the impossible.",
										"As Mirgal dropped to his knees in defeat, Aldyhn took hold of his spear in one hand, her blade in the other. Within the spear surged the magic her uncle wielded so irresponsibly. She uttered words of conjuring and the world shook as a portal ripped violently open. Aldyhn then slit her uncle's throat with the spear's blade and uttered ancient words.",
										"With these utterances, she sacrificed Mirgal to the forgotten gods that both the Yoten and Vanir worshipped. His dying breath, and the primal magic fueling the portal, birthed a new world. Though the magic seared her flesh, Aldyhn stood strong and ushered the last of the Vanir, and the innocents they protected, into these new lands even as rock and wind, tree and fire, were being formed and shaped before their eyes. As the last of the survivors fled the Lost Lands, Aldyhn did not look back as she stepped into Grimnir.",

										"Grimnir is a hard land. The north is home to islands covered by ice and snow, battered continuously by frigid winds whereas the lands to the south are inundated with volcanoes and jagged plains of lava rock stretch endlessly. The Serpent Sea weaves between these two harsh extremities encircling the rough and tumble inner continents and an uncountable number of fractured islands. Grimnir was created from Mirgal's sacrifice and it is said that the wizard's guilt and anguish over his treachery and failure is why the world is so impossibly volatile.",
										"After the Exodus, the hardy newcomers spread out and the Vanir eventually built their primary keep on the central continent, atop the mysterious mountain they named {@i Turnjfall}. Each year this mountain rises ever taller, still growing, as if determined to reach some point in the sky for reasons not even gods might fathom. At the mountain's summit the Vanir hid Mirgal's {@i rainbow spear}.",
										"Once a year, Aldyhn's son, Thonir, climbed the isolated and deadly valleys of Turnjfall to collect the amber apples that sustained the Vanir and provided them with their long lives. During those excursions, he once chanced upon a woman, and fell in love with her. Each year the couple would meet but one particularly cold spring morning, with winter's grip still tight on the land, the woman asked him to bring different apples to the Vanir. Blinded by love, he consented and took them from her to feed to his people.",
										"Upon biting into each apple, the other Vanir aged rapidly before Thonir's eyes. Only through the use of a powerful spell did they avert immediate death, but to keep alive, they had to become {@i something else}. Their flesh hardened as each Vanir transformed into a living statue, forever trapped where they took that ill-fated bite. In this form they have remained, for centuries.",
										"But this story was not yet finished.",
										"Thonir remained lost in mourning, perhaps for days, until a cold winter's evening when his lover's body was dragged into the clearing and dropped into the snow at his feet. Then his eyes opened, widened in horror. Boða, the foul Yoten that had destroyed the Lost Lands, revealed herself with a hideous snarl. She seized the {@i rainbow spear}, intent on opening a portal to the Lost Lands, to bring her fellow Yoten into Grimnir.",
										"It was not to be.",
										"The young warrior rose and took hold of a magical scythe as he leapt at Boða. There, before the blind gaze of his mother, his friends, his allies, he fought with a furious frenzy. Such a great blow did he land on the spear that he sundered the magical artifact into many pieces. Boða shrieked and flung herself at Thonir. The two, the last of the Vanir and the last of the Yoten, fought a final, epic battle that left both mortally wounded. They died together, their life blood staining the snowy fields of Grimnir.",
										"Upon both their deaths, a great storm of primal magic swept across Grimnir. The Vanir, though trapped in stone, were imbued with divinity, transformed into the gods now known as the Stone Court. Thonir's lover also changed rising from death but descending into the bowels of the world to become the caretaker of those that die from unjust means... the Lady of the Dead, a being that all raiders respect, but few worship.",
										"And of Thonir himself?",
										"The raiders believe he sits in the fabled Halls of the Slain feasting, drinking, and training the bravest of raider warriors who have ever died in battle. He presides over the valkry, the winged warrior women who bring the worthy dead to the halls. When a new evil rises to threaten Grimnir, Thonir and the dead legends from the past, it is said, shall return to defend the people.",

The völv have prophesied that if the spear were ever to be made whole again, it shall signal Grimnir's violent end. This has not deterred some from attempting the feat.",

These peoples build their towns deep within the forests and hills of various islands dotting the Serpent Sea. They have learned not to invite the attention of the raiders and for the most part have kept to themselves. But not always.",
										"Three centuries ago, a wanderer emerged from the ironwood forests that grow along the northern shores of Turnjfall. Giant-like in stature and covered completely in living armor harvested from those eldritch trees, he called himself the Witchking and forced the Baendur to bend their knee to him. He united them and waged war upon the raiders. It became clear that his intent was to recover the pieces of the rainbow spear and through many bloody skirmishes he claimed several.",
										"Only by uniting, were the raider clans able to overthrow the Witchking and end his influence on the Baendur. In so doing they seriously diminished the power that those inner kingdoms once wielded. The raiders called this first coming together the Gathering. And though the clans are still at strife with one another into modern times, the Gathering is held every eighth year. It is one of the most important elements holding raider society together.",
