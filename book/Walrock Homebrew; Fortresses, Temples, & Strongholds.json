At a dusty crossroads, a lone trading post invites all travelers, specially those with purses filled with gold, or lips laden with rumors.",

Immortality is available to all adventurers with sufficient coin, should they wish to build it.",

Structures that are created by the characters are an excellent opportunity for roleplaying, quests, and story, being an instantly visible and prominent part of the world to those in regions nearby.",
						"A structure included in a game is typically both a focal point of the campaign and an investment opportunity for the player characters. The more gold and time characters spend expanding, improving, and staffing their structure, the more benefits, defense, and utility it provides. A well-governed structure can act as a military bastion, a powerful trading hub, or the spiritual center of a faith, and those that control the structure may stand as the stewards of the fates of millions."
