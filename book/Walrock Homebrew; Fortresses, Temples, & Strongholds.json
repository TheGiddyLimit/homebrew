After the fall of the Paris commune, Courbet escaped the reprisals of the French government by entering a selfimposed exile to Switzerland, where he painted this piece in 1875, shortly before his death."

At a dusty crossroads, a lone trading post invites all travelers, specially those with purses filled with gold, or lips laden with rumors.",

Immortality is available to all adventurers with sufficient coin, should they wish to build it.",
						"Players often wish to leave their mark on the world, to establish something grand that can survive their characters and change the world around them, making it altogether better, worse, or simply different for its presence. Structures that are created by the characters are an excellent opportunity for roleplaying, quests, and story, being an instantly visible and prominent part of the world to those in regions nearby.",
						"A structure included in a game is typically both a focal point of the campaign and an investment opportunity for the player characters. The more gold and time characters spend expanding, improving, and staffing their structure, the more benefits, defense, and utility it provides. A well-governed structure can act as a military bastion, a powerful trading hub, or the spiritual center of a faith, and those that control the structure may stand as the stewards of the fates of millions."
