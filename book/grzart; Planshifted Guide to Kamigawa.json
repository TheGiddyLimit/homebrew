O-bakemono worshipped the oni with blood rites and sacrifices of living sentients in exchange for gifts of strength and supernatural powers. With the advent of the Kami War, the o-bakemono succeeded in freeing many of their oni masters from their spiritual prisons, together hoping to reshape Kamigawa on these principles.",

There might be a kami of a specific object, like the kami of imperial dishware, or powerful overarching concepts like Kyodai, the soul of Kamigawa.",
										"When the kami manifest into the ordinary world, their manifestation is a bit unstable and creates strange glowing energy objects orbiting around them. Mortals who bond to kami often display these orbiting objects as well. Furthermore, the strange of nature of kami magic often creates \"glitch\"-like iridescent cubes and strange shapes near merge-gates, or whenever spells are cast.",

										"For much of Kamigawa's history, power was concentrated in the hands of the elite. More recently, however, Kamigawa has found itself facing significant disruption to this status quo as new innovations have made access to power more widely and cheaply available to all. Key among these innovations were two: enhancers invented by the akki artisans of Sokenzanshi, and the method invented by the Saiba Futurists of drawing power directly from the spirit realm.",
										"The akki artisans had a long tradition of invention and ingenuity, as well as effectively using their scarce resources to great effect\u2014including kami-granted powers. Thanks to the enhancer, even though few people had deep relationships with the kami, they were now able to apply more efficiently whatever powers they had been granted.",
										"At the same time, the Saiba Futurists were conducting experiments with merges to test the nature of the spirit realm. As an unintended side effect, they discovered a way to draw on magic directly, without needing to form a bond with kami. These two technologies soon combined to form the basis of the boom in new technology that exploded across the plane.",
										"Among the more common pieces of technology is the personal wrist-mount, which can store useful data such as credit chips and identification. Holograms are used as interfaces for most technology, and security comes in the form of semblance or fingerprint scanners.",

Capture trees are used as stationary security cameras throughout the Empire.",

While vehicles have stat blocks like creatures, they are not intelligent creatures and do not act or move independently. Without a rider or pilot, a vehicle is an inert object. Vehicles usually have a score of 0 in Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. If a vehicle has a 0 in a score, it automatically fails any ability check or saving throw that uses that score. If a vehicle drops to 0 hit points, it is inoperable until it is repaired. An inoperable vehicle is incapacitated and can't move. A character with proficiency in smith's tools can restore 10 hit points to a damaged vehicle for each hour of work. If a vehicle becomes inoperable some other way, such as by a spell, a creature can restart the vehicle by using its action.",
