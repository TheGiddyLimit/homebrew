O-bakemono worshipped the oni with blood rites and sacrifices of living sentients in exchange for gifts of strength and supernatural powers. With the advent of the Kami War, the o-bakemono succeeded in freeing many of their oni masters from their spiritual prisons, together hoping to reshape Kamigawa on these principles.",

Key among these innovations were two: enhancers invented by the akki artisans of Sokenzanshi, and the method invented by the Saiba Futurists of drawing power directly from the spirit realm.",
										"The akki artisans had a long tradition of invention and ingenuity, as well as effectively using their scarce resources to great effect\u2014including kami-granted powers. Thanks to the enhancer, even though few people had deep relationships with the kami, they were now able to apply more efficiently whatever powers they had been granted.",
										"At the same time, the Saiba Futurists were conducting experiments with merges to test the nature of the spirit realm. As an unintended side effect, they discovered a way to draw on magic directly, without needing to form a bond with kami. These two technologies soon combined to form the basis of the boom in new technology that exploded across the plane.",

Vehicles usually have a score of 0 in Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. If a vehicle has a 0 in a score, it automatically fails any ability check or saving throw that uses that score. If a vehicle drops to 0 hit points, it is inoperable until it is repaired. An inoperable vehicle is incapacitated and can't move. A character with proficiency in smith's tools can restore 10 hit points to a damaged vehicle for each hour of work. If a vehicle becomes inoperable some other way, such as by a spell, a creature can restart the vehicle by using its action.",
