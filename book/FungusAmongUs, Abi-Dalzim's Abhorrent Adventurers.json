Their proclivity for torture and butchery ingratiates them and their strange habits to their equally-freakish neighbors. These healthy relationships among sinister creatures grant them the freedom and flexibility necessary to gather eyes.",

Through them, they glimpse fragments of secrets that would drive most mad.",

A jar of preserved eyes all but guarantees a hag’s favor, while a gift of clothing or jewelry adorned with eye imagery can placate an irritated one. Such practices save lives—for when one sees a Hemwick hag, another lurks in the shadows.",

Thus, they can form a coven with a single fellow hag, rather than two, with all the power such a relationship entails. If both members of the coven are Hemwick hags, one hides away, invisible, when others are present. The second welcomes guests in their bloodstained lairs, a filth-streaked amalgam of butcher’s shop, laboratory, and observatory. This invisibility serves them well in combat; the two pop in out of reality, surrounded by summoned specters, to carve their victims’ eyes out.",
                    "Not content with such vicious attacks, Hemwick hags conjure the eyeless specters of the creatures they harvested, which appear as lanky black humanoid silhouettes with blazing white lights in place of eyes. These ghastly creatures pursue the hags’ victims with mindless hatred, granting the invisible hags openings. A hag may also hex a target’s Wisdom, reducing its ability to perceive the pair, or cast hold person to lock their unfortunate target in place, giving the hag ample time to work."

A sanguine custard is a mindless mass of living blood that slithers from room to room in a vampire’s lair, where they can hide in exsanguinated corpses in relative comfort. A single vampire lair often contains dozens of sanguine custards. They only leave their hiding places to engage intruders, which they attack on sight. While weak and easily killed, the sodden cacophony of their clumsy attacks alerts other guards. Many a party of brave vampire slayers has met their end because they failed to slip past a single sanguine custard. ",
                    "Sanguine custards serve vampires in another way when in direct combat. Though they have an unpleasant flavor, vampires can use them as emergency rations. When threatened, the vampire calls the custard to leap into its mouth. With its last thoughts, the custard flows through the vampire’s digestive and circulatory systems and restores it to health. "

Golden crowns rest upon their brow above a rictus grin of lion’s teeth. A breastplate wraps around their armored breastplate, protecting the base of its wings, which roar like thunder.

Clever ambush predators, vapor slops hover in tight dungeon pathways with a convenient chimney or empty shaft nearby. When an unwitting creature passes through a vapor slop’s permeable outer skin, acrid toxins flood its lungs. The gossamer skin contracts and forces the gases inward, which catches its prey in a viselike air current. Air is similarly forced outward, which swells the slop’s balloonlike body and renders it lighter than air. ",
                    "The vapor slope then soars away on its newfound buoyancy, with a struggling, choking victim caught in its center. Vapor slops fly to their preferred nests, where they deflate around the now-suffocated target and begin to digest. If the poor creature lived through the flight, it will not for much longer. ",
                    "Though they may appear as passive as other oozes, vapor slops recognize danger before or after they hunt and defend themselves accordingly. They never stand and fight unless forced, and only engage if they’ve captured a meal too nutritious to abandon. Stinking cloud, a concentrated burst of its potent gases, keeps the most dangerous threats at a distance. Incendiary cloud detonates those same gases, and blocks the vision required for many spells. These floods of deadly gas force enemies back down the tight passages between the vapor slop’s lair and hunting grounds. The vapor slop then settles in to enjoy its prey, often a friend of its recent enemies. ",
                    "Vapor slops prefer a simple life in all aspects, not only hunting and combat. Though clearly intelligent and perceptive, they remain content to rearrange dust and sand into patterns. An idle vapor slop settles onto a dusty surface and, through dexterous contractions in its bubble-like skin, arranges particles into whorled partners that resemble “zen gardens” maintained in some eastern lands. ",
                    "Despite this clear interest in art and patterns, no vapor slop can understand language. Communication with one is nearly impossible, but a large meal distracts most. Many dungeon-goers sacrifice horses and cattle to the vapor slop. The prey must be alive or slain only moments ago; vapor slops ignore abandoned supplies and detest carrion. One will, however, leave the travelers in peace while it enjoys the hearty meal. Spellcasters that summon a temporary creature can only trick a vapor slop once…and the jilted ooze will remember the devious mage and take appropriate revenge at an opportune moment, even if it must leave its hunting grounds to do so.

Each spell with the reckoning tag has two effects: the first as listed in the spell’s text, and the second when cast as a reckoning. A reckoning is a special ritual by multiple spellcasters to enhance the effects of a spell far beyond its normal levels, with catastrophic and Biblical results. To cast a spell with such power, multiple mages must combine their strength and follow precise instructions utilizing cripplingly expensive material components. These requirements are listed in the spell’s description under the As a Reckoning section. Most reckoning spells are not meant to be readily accessible to most adventuring parties; players must leverage every social and financial asset at their disposal to cast even a single reckoning spell. These spells, whether wielded by heroes or villains, have the power to change the world.",

                                "To begin the ritual, the leader expends a spell slot of the appropriate level, channeling the magic into a focus within 30 feet of it, such as a cistern, circle of runes, sacrificial altar, or sphere of magic. Such a focus often is or contains the additional material component required when casting a spell as a reckoning.",
                                "Another spellcaster within 30 feet of the leader or focus can use an action to contribute to the ritual by expending a spell slot of its own. The spell slot can be of any level, but the spell can only be cast as a reckoning when the sum of the expended spell slots’ levels reaches the number listed in the spell’s reckoning tag. Each contributing spellcaster, including the leader, can contribute only one slot.",
                                "Once the required sum of spell slots is reached, the reckoning ritual begins. It takes 8 hours longer than normal to cast a spell as a reckoning, and each participant must concentrate on it for the full duration, as though concentrating on a spell.",
                                "If a spellcaster’s concentration ends or it moves more than 30 feet away from the leader or focus, its contribution is removed. It, or another creature that is not currently participating in the ritual can take its place in the ritual instead within 10 minutes.",
                                "In either case, the entrant expends a new spell slot of a level necessary to meet the spell’s reckoning value or higher. If 10 minutes pass and the total required number of spell slots is not re-attained, the ritual is interrupted and the spell may fail, create a partial effect, or otherwise go awry, at the discretion of the Dungeon Master.",

                                "Dispelling a reckoning spell with a duration of “until dispelled” is difficult. The caster cannot affect the reckoning with {@spell dispel magic}, {@spell counterspell}, or similar magic unless it targets or affects the space the ritual leader stood in when the spell took effect. An {@spell antimagic field} spell and similar magic has no effect on rituals to cast reckoning spells. The DC of the ability check to stop or end the spell, if required, is 30."
