								"{@b Resources.} Following the examples in Xanathar's Guide toEverything, training a horde typically takes at least ten workweeks, but this time is reduced by a number of work weeks equal to the commander's Intelligence modifier(an Intelligence penalty doesn't increase the time needed).Training requires providing the horde salary every workweek,with a suggested cost of 250 gp per workweek. Once this training is complete, the horde gains one of the options detailed in the Training Options section.",
								"{@b Complications.} Complications that arise while training may relate to the horde's morale or capability. Every ten workweeks spent in training brings a 10 percent chance of a complication, examples of which are on the Horde TrainingComplications table.",
