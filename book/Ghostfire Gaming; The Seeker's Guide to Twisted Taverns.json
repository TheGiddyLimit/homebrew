The track can be circular for an infinite loop to bring you back to where you started, or an end-to-end journey with adventure along the way. As a variant way to play using this book, the Rail-Away can serve as a cruise vessel that visits all the other taverns in order.",

Alternatively, you can play through its combination of quests and a murder mystery event using the NPCs provided.",
