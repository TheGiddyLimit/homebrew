As their divine virtuosity dwindles, their Celestial progenitor reminds them that the most holy use of their voice is to uplift others as much as themselves, and returning to their calling opens the font of inspiration once more."

Or, the godsigner may awaken during a quiet moment\u2014perhaps, on the verge of breaking and despair, they hear a soft melody that reminds them who they are.",

For example, Bolstering Hymn could gain a range of 60 feet instead of 30 feet for 7 days (or, if near the end of the campaign, until the end of the story). Boundless Voice could last an hour instead of 10 minutes. Tying even a small mechanical boon to the moment of awakening can greatly increase the impact of such a moment, creating catharsis and triumph."
