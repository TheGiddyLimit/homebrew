For example, Bolstering Hymn could gain a range of 60 feet instead of 30 feet for 7 days (or, if near the end of the campaign, until the end of the story). Boundless Voice could last an hour instead of 10 minutes. Tying even a small mechanical boon to the moment of awakening can greatly increase the impact of such a moment, creating catharsis and triumph."

If 2021 was figuring out if we could pull off {@i ARCADIA}, then 2022 is figuring out how far we can push it. Next year includes some of the most ambitious articles yet, including drop-in puzzles, rules for Tiny and Large characters, and a new class meant for one-player and one-GM playing published adventures meant for more than a single character. Plus even more adventures, encounters, monsters, magic items, and character options!",
