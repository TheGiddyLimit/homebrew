						"Picture this situation: The player characters see a ges ticulating wizard floating over a dark chasm. As if by magic, a light goes on in a player's brain. He declares that his character charges headlong off the edge of the cliff, expecting that he'll continue across the invis ible bridge that doubtless spans the chasm.",
						"What do you do in this situation?",
						"Despite your natural inclination to let the player kill off his character, your reflexes probably kick in. You laugh, or you cock an eyebrow, or you say, \"Ohhh-kay?\" after you spit out your drink. With a flash of insight, the player realizes that there may be other explanations why the wizard can defy grav ity. Maybe, just maybe, you'll let him halt his charge before he discovers the exact depth of the chasm the hard way.",
						"Then you realize you have fallen prey again to the DM's Dirty Little Secret: you're really on the players' side. You use your omniscience and omnipotence to keep your PCs alive and happy (at least in the long term, resurrections being what they are). You don't tell your players that, though, because they keep putting their precious PCs in situations where you have to pull their fat out of the fireball. After all, you have a responsibility to keep them coming back.",
						"And some days, that responsibility gets to you. You're not a fifth or sixth or seventh PC. You're the Dungeon Master. Some days, you get that urge to show them you're not on their side, and that you have the power and cleverness to let them know who's boss.",
						"Welcome to the book that's designed for those bad dice days. The Book of Challenges: Dungeon Rooms, Puzzles, and Traps is composed of dozens of the smartest and meanest encounters we could envision. This is the book of \"Oh, man!\" and \"I can't believe it!\" and \"You have to be kidding me!\" Yes, the encounters are balanced by encounter level, and yes, they can all be solved with a little thought. Yes, we even provide hints you can give your players. But fundamentally, they're all just a bit nasty. If a player announces that he's going over a cliff in one of these encounters, he's going over the cliff.",
						"Because sometimes, even we have one of those days.",

							"page": 3,
							"entries": [
								"The Book of Challenges contains encounters you can plug into your favorite dungeon. Most are set against the backdrop of a \"typical\" dungeon, but with a little preparation, you can use them in any adventuring context. These encounters generally need very little introduction. In most of them, the PCs walk down a dungeon corridor and see what's in the room (or don't see it, depending on the amount of invisibility used). They resolve the challenge, lick their wounds, and then go on to some other part of the dungeon.",
								"The book is sorted by encounter level (EL). To choose an encounter for your players, figure out their characters' average party level. Pick an encounter with an EL that matches or comes close to that average.",
								"Of course, you'll need to familiarize yourself with the capabilities of the items and creatures mentioned herein. In most cases, when an average creature is used, this book only shows the differences between the Monster Manual description and the description here. The book provides help in how to use these aspects of the encounters, but that doesn't substitute for research on your part.",
								"This book also contains many sidebars with tips for Dungeon Masters. You can use them to customize the encounters in your game or create similar types of encounters yourself. You'll find the legend for all the maps in this product on page 127.",
								"Most encounters have entries for \"Scaling the Challenge.\" These allow you to use the encounter at a higher or lower EL than the one given at the top of the entry. Even if your characters are all 10th level, you can use encounters at other ELs when you find these scaling sections. Don't forget to change the treasure awarded if you alter the encounter level. Treasure appropriate to an EL 5 encounter seems paltry for an EL 9 encounter, and far too rewarding for an EL 3 encounter."

								"At any time, you can throw six orcs running down a 10-foot-wide corridor at your players' characters. That may be a good fight for some parties, but it's hardly clever. If the orcs suffer ranged weapon fire, not all of them will be able to reach the PCs' front line, and none of them will be able to reach the PCs' back line.",
								"A clever encounter takes advantage of the mon sters' or NPCs' capabilities and tactics. Clever crea tures should spend a lot of time thinking about how they might survive an encounter with well-armed PCs. Six orcs parked behind nine-tenths cover with heavy crossbows, and a gaping pit in front of them now that might be a challenge. Four orcs in that situa tion, plus two on a ledge behind the PCs might be even better. Four orcs running from a rampaging hill giant. . . well, you get the idea.",
								"Here are six general strategies for maximizing effectiveness of the monsters and NPCs you throw at your PCs.",
								"{@bold Box Them In}: Most players think of fights in one direction, the one where they close to meet the com batants. PCs attacked from several sides are automat ically at a disadvantage, because they must choose where their area spells go, worry about being flanked, and separate to attack multiple foes.",
								"{@bold Split Them Up}: If you can separate the party members from each other, they won't be able to cooperate. Trap the scouts behind a barrier, drop the spellcasters through a trapdoor, or use nets and bull rushes to drag the PCs kicking and screaming away from each other. Get flying creatures into the air, so that flying PCs have to leave their friends to attack flying enemies with melee weapons. Be careful with this one, though. Splitting the party neutralizes the cooperative nature of the group, which won't be fun if it happens all the time.",
								"{@bold Show Them One Thing, Give Them Another}: A mid-level party seeing three iron golems coming at it will have a panic attack. But a hill giant sorcerer could easily cover two cronies and himself with illusions that make them appear as iron golems\u2014and he may stop the PCs from casting spells on them, since the PCs will falsely believe they're useless against the \"constructs.\" Deception only needs to last a few rounds to be meaningful. A self-censoring party is a far less dangerous one.",
								"{@bold Make Them Dig Deep}: In a lair of cold creatures, only the sorcerers will be able to muster enough fire spells to win. Using many of the same types of creatures drains a subset of the party's resources while never tapping into another subset. The heroes need to ration resources, and that benefits those on the receiving end of the PCs' wrath.",
								"{@bold Set Them Up, Knock Them Down}: Two creatures with compatible powers can combine to be much more effective. A wyvern's poison deals Constitution damage, and an achaierai's insanity requires a Fortitude save. If the achaierai attacks immediately after the wyvern drops a PC's Constitution into the single digits, that PC probably won't make his saving throw against the insanity. Two near-simultaneous attacks can mean one dead PC. For these sorts of battles, your monsters probably act on the same initiative number, though one can always delay a moment or two.",
								"{@bold Hang Them if They Can't Take a Joke}: Make sure you have a way out for any creature that wants to get away. A flying creature fighting at the edge of a cliff has a much better chance to get away than one in a closed room. The PCs still get the experience, but they lose any treasure the escaping NPCs are carrying. That alone gets the heroes to be more strategic in the future."

							"name": "RUNNING A CLEVER PUZZLE",
							"page": 4,
							"entries": [
								"Many DMs are wary of making puzzles. Others are too comfortable making them, sometimes without realizing the complexity some puzzles require. To find the right level of comfort, identify a puzzle type you can create and then practice until you create a memorable one.",
								"To set up a puzzle, figure out what you want it to do. Do you want to deliver a message, provide a clue to a mystery, or make solving the puzzle the only way out of a deathtrap? When you have figured that out, pick a puzzle type. Several puzzles in this book come with sidebars on how to make others like them. Mazes, letter-addition puzzles, and codes all have simple principles you can follow. Of course, these sidebars can't provide the cleverness you'll need to challenge your players.",
								"Then try making the puzzle. Use the strategies herein, and keep trying them until you conclude that you would like to solve the puzzle if another DM presented it to you.",
								"Try to personalize your puzzles. They need to make sense in the world your PCs inhabit. Don't give them a puzzle about rock music or cars, because the PCs have never heard of either. Instead, use references to NPCs, cities in your world, or monsters the PCs might face.",
								"Before you give your puzzles to the PCs, write a list of hints. These should usually be rewards for making successful skill checks. A puzzle about magic items could require a Knowledge (arcana) check, for instance. In all cases, a simple Intelligence check should give a hint of what type of puzzle the PCs face. You can also devise hints that require spells or class features, such as letting a cleric use his turn undead ability to open a magically locked chest bearing the visage of a ghoul.",
								"When the PCs solve a puzzle, reward them. Just solving a puzzle makes them feel smart, but solving a puzzle that hands them a magic item or opens a secret door makes them feel smart and accomplished."

								"When the characters fall prey to a trap, they're usually unprepared, unwary, or outclassed. Players take great pride in getting past traps, because they think that means they're smarter than the makers of the dungeon. Conversely, they feel great shame when they walk right into the trap.",
								"To see all the parts of a great dungeon trap, look to a real-world example: the mousetrap. A mousetrap has three parts: the bait, the trigger, and the illusion of safety. The mouse is attracted by the bait (some cheese), trips the trigger (a pressure-sensitive neck-breaker), and is stunned when it happens (since the neck-breaker seems far removed from the cheese). Although your PCs are (hopefully) a bit smarter than mice, the same principles apply.",
								"The bait should always be something the PCs want. Before you flip to the treasure chapter in the DUNGEON MASTER's Guide, think a little deeper about what they really want. They want experience. They want to conserve their resources. Most importantly, they want to feel comfortable breaking into something's lair and killing it. These characters are easy to motivate, because simply presenting a door plays into the PCs' expectation that they can walk unimpeded through a dangerous area.",
								"The trap's trigger can be magical, mechanical, or both. Almost any spell or device can become a trap if given some thought. Even the ultra-benign raise dead spell can trigger the revival of something the PCs want to stay dead. If your PCs can shrug off the damage from a crossbow trap, set up a ballista trap. The best triggers are ones that create some amusing, embarrassing, or otherwise memorable victimization, such as a hidden catapult that propels a PC into a freezing cold river. The illusion of safety is the most important element. A trap should go off when the PCs are comfortable with their situation. A rickety bridge spanning a crevasse does not appear safe, but a door on which the PCs have already disabled a trap with a low Search DC does. Put them on guard when their guard is down, and knock them off guard when their guard is up.",
								"For more on the making of traps, see Chapter 4 of the DUNGEON MASTER's Guide and the supplement, Song and Silence: A Guidebook to Bards and Rogues."

								"This book requires significant adaptability on the players' part. A key component of that is their spell selection. Walking into these atypical environs armed with nothing but fireballs and lightning bolts may make for frequent trips to the local purveyor of raise dead spells.",
								"Whether prepared or set into magic items, the spells that follow are must-haves for dealing with the brain-bending challenges in this book. You shouldn't be disappointed when players use these spells to thwart the challenges herein. Instead, you should take magnanimous pride that your players are sharp enough to use resources so efficiently.",
								"Clairaudience/{@spell Clairvoyance}: Forewarned is forearmed, and this is one of the best ways in the game to be forewarned. At higher levels, players should consider foresight, scrying, and true seeing to get results that are even more reliable. Augury can be helpful, but players may not be willing to risk the spell's chance of failure in a life-or-death situation. (A bat familiar's blindsight ability has a similar effect, but a player who sends his leather-winged pal into every room may soon be looking for a new familiar.)",
								"Detect Magic: Many of these challenges involve unexpected uses of magic. Knowing where the magic is can help characters immensely. Spellcasters should always press for more information about the number, location, schools, and strengths of the auras they detect, allowing for educated guesses about what's there.",
								"{@spell Dispel Magic}: Once the characters know magic is there, their spellcasters should consider blowing it away, at least for a time. In some cases where there are many magical effects, this can require a lot of dispel checks, some of which will certainly fail. Again, detect magic helps here. At higher levels, greater dispelling, globe of invulnerability, and antimagic field can be used to a similar effect. Mordenkainen's disjunction is also a good choice, but it is often an overreaction.",
								"{@spell Fly}: In some cases (but definitely not all), the physical barriers in these encounters can be skirted by flying. The impressive speed and versatility of flight allows characters to meet challenges in three dimensions rather than two, something their opponents may not be able to address. If characters don't have access to this spell, levitate, jump, spider climb, and feather fall are highly recommended.",
								"{@spell Freedom of Movement}: Many challenges in here impede the characters' ability to move freely. Being able to fight normally underwater, in webs, or in other difficult surroundings counters the natural advantages of the creatures and traps in these encounters.",
								"Gaseous Form: Most challenges in this book are physical. When the characters simply wish to bypass them, becoming less physical certainly helps. This spell and the more powerful wind walk are even more effective in these cases than polymorph self and polymorph other. After all, changing into a bird won't give a PC damage reduction 20/+1 and the ability to seep through cracks in walls.",
								"{@spell Invisibility}: The challenges involving creatures are less effective if the creatures can't find the characters. Invisibility and its more powerful associated spells often can stop these encounters before the creatures get started. Of course, some creatures in here can see invisible characters, a fact those creatures might not reveal immediately.",
								"{@spell Mage Hand}: This spell has two purposes here. The first is jostling small objects and traps. The second is discovering when this isn't possible, since mage hand moves only unattended objects of 5 pounds or less. Thus, if mage hand can't move a small object, the caster knows the object is not what it seems. Telekinesis and unseen servant do this more effectively, as can summoning a creature that can understand the caster and thus do more than simply attack.",
								"{@spell Magic Missile}: Though this spell does less damage than either fireball or a barbarian with a double-axe, energy spells and melee attacks are often thwarted in these encounters by environmental factors like water, resistances, and barriers. Magic missile strikes unerringly, even around most types of cover and concealment.",
								"{@spell Teleport}: When all else fails, flee. Teleport, dimension door, word of recall, phase door, and similar spells make this tactic a lot easier on a moment's notice.",
								"Other good spell choices include arcane lock, break enchantment, daylight, detect snares and pits, detect thoughts, disintegrate, displacement, endure elements, find traps, find the path, ghost sound, guidance, hold portal, invisibility purge, knock, light, message, project image, protection from elements, quench, repulsion, resist elements, see invisibility, shatter, silence, slow, stone tell, water breathing, wood shape\u2014and, of course, raise dead.",

										"Multiple traps of the same type do not necessarily have the same additive effect on Encounter Levels that multiple monsters of the same type do. If you have a trap of a certain CR, adding another such trap nearby raises the EL by 1. Adding any greater number of such traps may raise the EL by an additional 1, but might not even do that. This is because a single solution that can beat one trap can usually beat any number of similar traps.",
										"For example, imagine a long line of pit traps. If the PCs use fly spells to get over the first one, they can use the same spells to get over the rest of them. Thus, the additional traps don't really represent an additional challenge, nor do they represent an additional drain on the PCs' resources.",
										"In this book, when multiple traps appear side by side, they are given a CR rating for each individual trap, then one for the entire group. This gives you the maximum XP the party gets for dealing with that group of traps."

								"Throughout the Book of Challenges, we have provided numerous encounters designed to stretch not only the capabilities of the players and their characters, but those of the monsters as well. The Monster Manual has specific rules for making monsters tougher by raising their Hit Dice, while the Player's Handbook and DUNGEON MASTER's Guide provide tools for adding character levels to monsters and adding traps to their lairs.",
								"For a change of pace, a DM may want to scale a monster down, making it weaker. The possible reasons for scaling down an encounter are numerous. So are the ways to do it.",
								"The most complicated way to scale down a creature is by reversing the process for scaling it up. Removing Hit Dice removes skills and combat abilities. It may reduce the effectiveness of spell-like abilities or even the number of spells a creature can cast per day. Reducing a creature's size (say, from Large to Medium-size), not only lowers its physical ability scores, but could provide an interesting story angle as well (for instance, a runt minotaur hoping to win the respect of his peers).",
								"Hampering monsters the same way a DM hampers characters can be less work for the same reward. Perhaps an ettin has lost his greatclubs or a titan no longer has his warhammer. Creatures with limited use abilities, such as the gorgon or the manticore, may have already used some or all of them for the day. This tactic works as long as the players can be made aware of the limitation. Maybe an ogre mage used his cone of cold earlier that day to kill an owlbear. If the players find a partially frozen owlbear corpse, they have a chance to figure out their nemesis is not up to full strength.",
								"As an alternative, consider putting a powerful creature in an environment that's hostile to it, or simply inconvenient. Perhaps a kuo-toa took a wrong turn getting back to the pool and ended up in the courtyard of an abandoned castle. With the sun coming up soon, the adventurers can wait in the stables for the right moment to strike. If the griffon the party is running from is foolish enough to follow them into a thick grove of trees, its maneuverability is drastically cut down. The same way you play up a creature's intelligence to make it tougher, playing up a creature's stupidity can help even the odds. Even smart monsters can make bad decisions.",
								"The Hill Giant Madness encounter demonstrates another equalizer: ability loss from disease. Using cursed items can further offset a creature's powers, as it did for Motty. Creatures can even have permanent spell effects on them from previous adventures, such as blindness or bestow curse.",
								"At the lower end of desirability, but still acceptable in certain situations, is simply knocking down hit points. Consider a mimic that hasn't had time to fully heal after its last encounter with a group of goblins.",
								"Like most of the tricks in this book, scaled-down monsters should be used sparingly. You should never introduce a new monster type as a weakened version. Using scaled-down monsters may make the players unimpressed, unprepared, or reckless when they meet the normal version. Even if they have seen the monster before, they may feel cheated if they run into weakened monster after weakened monster.",
								"Scaling down the CRs is an inexact science at best, and that may lead to more complications when assigning experience points. Used judiciously, however, it offers more opportunities for cleverly designed encounters."

These two creatures provide good examples of monster advancement.",

Applying the monster advancement rules gave it good hit points (15d8), a great attack bonus (as fighter), and three good saves, making it significantly tougher as well. The extra feats are incredibly handy. The extra skill points don't mean much in this encounter. This merits a CR 2 increase, so it's now CR 10. Tripling it would probably result in an increase of 4, to CR 12.",

The low number of skill points doesn't matter to the render. Looking at the finished monster, it seems to merit a CR 3 increase, so it's now CR "

								"One of the most overlooked directions in the typical DUNGEONS & DRAGONS® campaign is, well, any one other than horizontal. Characters walk the halls of dungeons and run around the courtyards of castles, while players move miniatures around a flat surface (usually a tabletop). Players (and even DMs) often forget that challenges can come from any direction, not just from down the hallway to the left or the 10-foot-deep pit trap up ahead. Some monsters fly, and some characters respond by using magic to fly as well. Despite this, most encounters in the course of an evening's adventures take place in two dimensions.",
								"The common pit trap is the only vertical encounter that's likely to appear in every campaign or adventure. While pit traps are an annoyance for an adventuring party of nearly any level, after the second or third encounter with one, the average player simply rolls his eyes and searches his character sheet for rope to pull out his clumsy companion. One solution to this tedium is adding spice to the pit traps themselves. Spikes added at the bottom, secret doors leading to secret rooms, and deadly water traps are just a few ways to make pits more memorable.",
								"Solutions also exist outside the box, so to speak. Several of the encounters in this book make use of different kinds of vertical space. While a creative Dungeon Master can expand on those encounters, many general ideas can help the DM who wishes to design her own adventure.",
								"The simplest solution is reversing the usual. For example, instead of pit traps, why not ceiling traps? Watch the fun the first time the ceiling opens up and rocks fall on your heroes. Ceiling traps can be deadly (the classic splash of hot oil), or just annoying (the not-so-classic flood of warm molasses). Having hidden doors in the ceiling allows monsters to hide above the characters, dropping down on them when the time is right. For creatures without the ability to fly, try adding balconies, or have creatures hide on the ceilings of high caverns.",

								"Less capricious creatures might have more subtle responses. For example, the will-o-wisps in the Lightin the Dark encounter may simply pretend they don'tnotice a scouting familiar. After it leaves, theybecome invisible and lie in wait for the party. In such situations, the familiar's information is likely to be inaccurate; it saw lights but no live creatures.",
								"Fortunately, most familiars have a reasonable sense of self-preservation and a good dose of common sense (even if their masters don't). Without any prompting from the master, a familiar is apt to avoid moving around in plain sight. Instead, it may look for places to hide, pausing to sniff the air and listen for danger before entering a chamber, or even rounding a corner. These precautions slow the familiar's progress, limiting the quality of information it can relay back to its master.",
								"Once a familiar locates a creature, it's apt to take the better part of valor and withdraw before it can be spotted. Of course, the familiar's master can order it to take a few risks, but eventually, the familiar's luck runs out. The master is then rewarded with a slain familiar and the accompanying loss of experience points."

With every release of a new book or supplement, this player instantly begins poring over it, looking for the best combination of spells or classes. To him, the rules are simply a math exercise. Roleplaying is set aside while he figures  different ways to add up bonuses and tries to bend the rules until they break. These players are often labeled \"power gamers\" or \"rules lawyers.\"",

They may hire a sage to get information on the castle they are about to explore. Perhaps they know the sunken ship is filled with undead, so they memorize specific spells useful in that situation. Maybe they fought a memorable villain who escaped, so they have discussed a strategy to defeat him next time. This kind of play should always be encouraged. A well-prepared DM can handle all the curve balls the players throw and, to be honest, most players are able to get themselves in more mischief than a DM who tries to adjust a situation against them.",

If a DM doesn't like this, she can talk to her players, offering the following bits of wisdom:",

The caster becomes a trusted friend and ally, but the character still retains his feelings about his other party members. He strongly values the caster's views and recommendations but can choose his own actions. A charmed paladin seeks to protect her new friend, but she would not agree to maiming or killing innocent townsfolk.",

It shouldn't be obvious to all the players when one character becomes charmed, but a failed saving throw, followed by a \"secret\" note, is a remarkably unsubtle message to the other players that something's up.",
								"When preparing to run a game session with an opponent who can cast charm or compulsion spells, you might want to choose your target ahead of time and plan how you want to tell the target about the spell's effect. To keep the spell effect as secret as possible, treat everyone alike. When it comes time for the target to make the save, take a moment to pull each player aside separately, allowing each to make some kind of roll (such as a Spot check to notice some detail of the situation). This masks the fact that one of the characters has made a Will save (though a successful save should allow that character to inform the others that he felt something). If you prefer to pass notes, pass everyone a (different) note.",

In addition, incorporeal creatures ignore armor, natural armor bonuses, and cover bonuses, though force effects, such as mage armor, shield, and wall of force, work normally with respect to incorporeal creatures.",

For example, the spectres in this encounter can hide in floors, ceilings, columns, or quicksand, but they can't see through them. While waiting in ambush inside a solid object, an incorporeal creature must listen for foes or periodically stick out its head for a look around. Solid objects tend to carry sound very well, so you may wish to adjust the creature's DC for a perception checks holding their ear to the ground/wall. The usual modifiers for distance apply. An incorporeal creature can try to pinpoint an opponent from inside a solid object; this uses the same rules as pinpointing invisible opponents",
								"Even so, the incorporeal creature can get only a vague idea of an opponent's location by listening, so it must occasionally stick its head out for a look around. A good way to simulate this is by picking a spot at the edge of the object in which it hides that is somewhere within a half move of its position at the end of its turn. During the creature's next turn, assume it moves to that spot first, no matter where the creature's opponents are. Once the creature looks around, it can finish its action and perhaps attack a foe it can reach with its remaining move.",

For example, a spectre can fly at a speed of 80 feet (even though walls), but it has only good maneuverability, so it's limited to 90-degree turns.

When characters are told that something is within their grasp, they might still be happy when they receive something else. Then again, they might not, especially if it is perceived to be of lesser value. A DM using a bait-and-switch should paint the reward acquired in the best possible light. For example, if the characters believe they are hunting a lich, when in fact, they have defeated a skeleton dressed up as a lich, have the local townsfolk hail them as lich-killers\u2014even if the real lich gets away to plot its revenge.",
								"{@bold The Hidden Cost}: A salesperson offering something for nothing may well be offering nothing for something. An item that appears to be free often is either worthless or has a hidden cost (usually one that's quite high). This plays on the instinctive human nature to take something that appears to be free. Those falling for this scam frequently ask, \"What's the catch?\" This is a can't-miss opportunity for the salesperson, because once the victim believes she's discovered all the hidden costs, she almost always makes the deal. For example, a character never leaves a magic item alone if she finds it unattended in the middle of a corridor. It may well be a monitoring device to keep tabs on the heroes, or a cursed item, or even a deathtrap. More importantly, though, it's free.",
								"{@bold The Empty Promise}: In the absence of morality and law, a verbal promise is worth the paper it's printed on. A salesperson making a claim about an item's qualities need be concerned only about the ones that can be verified before purchase. After that, an item may break down, require a source of power, or simply not provide the service described. For example, someone selling a purported amulet of undead turning probably doesn't need to worry about buyers bringing undead with them to test its power. He may well have to worry about identify spells and the detection of abjuration magic, though, so he should take precautions to make sure the item holds up to such tests.",
								"{@bold The Unwarranted Warranty}: When an item fails in its purpose, the customer wants the ability to return the item for a refund or trade-in. An unscrupulous salesperson knows that the warranty is meaningless if the customer can't interact with the purveyor again. If the purveyor moves and cannot be found, the transaction is complete at the moment of sale. If the customer can't return to the purveyor (say, if the promised teleportation device doesn't bring the customer back after a thousand-mile trip), the transaction is also a one-time exchange. This is the genesis of the business principle caveat emptor, which generally means that without an enforceable warranty, the buyer takes the risk.",
								"{@bold The Loss Leader}: This legal technique is nonetheless easily abused. A loss leader is an item that's sold at a loss to encourage further purchases at a profit. If the buyer assumes further purchases have the same terms of transaction as the loss leader, the sale is duplicitous. Poker and pool players have seen this many times: A shark loses a first game to entice an unwary player in, but when the stakes rise, the shark's true ability surfaces. In a dungeon, if a party defeats a group of orcs easily, they may be caught off-guard when the next group of similar-looking orcs includes a few 5th-level barbarians."

It's more than just a matter of getting the CR correct (for instance, a dire tiger, gray render, and gynosphinx are all CR 8). This method requires the DM to create the right atmosphere and have the presentation make sense. Dire tigers are animals, so they can't talk.

								"Multiple-opponent encounters usually provide more of a challenge than a single creature\u2014both for the characters and the DM. Multiple opponents can flank, they aren't as vulnerable to \"save or lose\" spells such as hold monster or disintegrate, and it's harder for PCs to gang up on them.",
								"On the other hand, multiple-opponent encounters give a wider array of classes an opportunity to contribute. In Dark Hunt, paladins and clerics can use their special powers against the undead. The rogue can sneak attack the living creatures and team up with other characters for flanking bonuses. Rangers also have several potentials for their favored enemy bonus: undead, magical beasts, and outsiders.",
								"Of course, running a complex, multiple-opponent encounter can be a hassle. Here are some tips to help these kinds of encounters move smoothly.",
								"{@i Simplify Initiative}. Roll initiative by type of monster instead of rolling for each individual creature. Combine mounts with their riders, taking whichever is worse. For instance, this encounter has eight creatures, but you can simplify their actions by having three initiative rolls: Valencia and her nightmare mount, Falessel and her nightmare mount, and the winter wolves.",
								"{@i Use note cards}. Put each player character, NPC, and monster type on a note card. Note their initiative counts and sort them by those numbers. Once the action starts, you can flip through the cards to tell who goes next. If someone wants to delay, lay the card aside and reinsert it when they take their action. With a bit of planning, your note cards can be more elaborate. For instance, you might find it useful to include the character or creature's Spot skill or Armor Class.",
								"{@i Keep accurate records}. Create a small table to track hit points (and initiative counts, if you're not using note cards). Many DMs do this on scratch paper or in the margins of the text, but for complicated encounters, a separate table can come in handy. You can also list other pertinent notes, such as resistances. The Dark Hunt Summary Page provides an example."

								"Dungeon Masters often use the Monster Manual the same way they use dictionaries. They open it up to check the statistics of a troupe of orcs or pack of gorgons the same way you would use a dictionary to check the spelling of \"porcine\" or \"petrification.\" However, just as the dictionary can't teach the best way to put words together in everyday speech, the Monster Manual doesn't tell you which combinations of monsters work well in encounters. With this in mind, don't limit your \"syntax\" to single monsters. Combining them can make for some interesting alternatives.",
								"Troll and Pets, which features a hermitlike troll and his pet rust monsters, is only one combination of many that can be created with careful  planning. Creatures with powers that complement each other are especially good choices, such as the vampires and nightmares in Dark Hunt (an EL 13 encounter later in this book). Few rules need to be followed when mixing monster types, as long as you can create plausible reasoning behind your choices.",
								"In general, stronger creatures bully or control weaker creatures. This situation might change if the weaker creature is significantly smarter, such as a cunning imp leading an uneducated hill giant. Very powerful creatures do not usually ally with other creatures but may still use them as minions, pets, and slaves. Powerful creatures, on the other hand, often have enough resources to get what they want and survive on their own.",
								"When creatures work in tandem, each should have its own motivation. Those motivations could be similar, but it makes for a short companionship if their needs aren't met. For example, a drider and a hill giant may form a temporary alliance to drive off inhabitants of a small village that has been unknowingly built on a system of caverns. In this case, the drider gains a new lair and the giant gets valuable treasure, along with the village's herd of cattle. The two may never work together again, or they may team up to raid a small dwarven mining village down the road later that month when the cows run out, no doubt leading to another unusual encounter for the player characters."

								"Land-based creatures can have considerable difficulty when fighting in water. Water affects a creature's Armor Class, attack rolls, damage, and movement. In some cases, a creature's opponents may get a bonus to attack the creature. The effects are summarized below:",
								"{@bold Fire}: Nonmagical fire (including alchemist's fire) does not burn underwater. Spells or spell-like effects with the Fire descriptor are ineffective underwater unless the caster makes a successful Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level). If the check succeeds, the spell creates a bubble of steam instead of its usual fiery effect, but otherwise the spell works as described. Supernatural fire effects are ineffective underwater unless their descriptions state otherwise.",
								"The surface of a body of water blocks line of effect for any fire spell. If the caster has made a Spellcraft check to make the fire spell useful underwater, the surface still blocks the spell's line of effect. For example, a fireball cast underwater cannot be targeted at creatures above the surface.",
								"{@bold Attacks from Land}: Characters swimming, floating, or treading water on the surface, or wading in water at least chest deep have one-quarter cover against melee or ranged attacks from opponents on land. Land-bound opponents who have freedom of movement effects ignore this cover when making melee attacks against targets in the water. A completely submerged creature has one-half cover against opponents on land unless those opponents have a freedom of movement effects. Magical effects are unaffected, except for those that require attack rolls (which are treated like any other effects) and fire effects.",
								"{@bold Ranged Attacks Underwater}:Thrown weapons are ineffective underwater, even when launched from land. Other ranged weapons suffer a\u20132 penalty on attack rolls for every 5 feet of water they pass through, in addition to the normal penalties for range.",
								"{@bold Underwater Visibility}: Submerged or swimming creatures may also gain concealment from the water, depending on how clear it is. Even perfectly clear water obscures vision (including darkvision) beyond 200 feet. A creature in perfectly clear water has one-quarter concealment at 50 feet (10% miss chance), one-half concealment at 100 feet (20% miss chance), three-quarters concealment at 150 feet (30% miss chance), and nine-tenths concealment at 200 feet (40% miss chance). Beyond 200 feet, the creature has total concealment (50% miss chance) and opponents cannot use sight to locate it.",
								"Water that isn't as clear obscures vision at a shorter distance, and creatures in it are concealed at a shorter distance. Creatures have one-half concealment at half the given distance, nine-tenths concealment at the given distance, and total concealment beyond that distance. For example, if murky water limits vision to 40 feet, creatures have one-half concealment at 20 feet, nine-tenths concealment at 40 feet, and total concealment beyond 40 feet.",
								"The maximum sighting distance in murky water is 100 feet. Water can be so murky that it allows vision only to 5 feet or even 0 feet. Aquatic creatures can see twice as far through the water as other creatures can (although twice 0 feet is still 0 feet)."

								"Antimagic zones seem like an easy solution to controlling high-level characters, but like any other tactic, they should be used in moderation. Characters presumably earn the magic items they possess, so throwing antimagic zones at them every time you want to toughen up an encounter can discourage PCs. Overusing this tactic goes over about as well as giving a character a ring of fire resistance before leading him into an underwater adventure. Antimagic is also a double-edged sword, since higher-level monsters may also rely on magical or supernatural abilities.",
								"When you use the tactic, be creative with the reasoning. If antimagic were easy to obtain, every fortress would be covered in it to prevent magical invasion. Use unique circumstances, such as a puzzle or trap, and give the players a way to circumvent it. Players feel much less manipulated if the zones are used to accent a tough encounter, instead of being the sole reason for its design."

The person who carves the runes chooses a passphrase in Abyssal. When the passphrase is spoken aloud (whispering counts) within 15 feet of the door, the trap is rendered inert for 1 minute.",

The runes can be spotted with a DC 15 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check, but a character can feel the runes if it runs its hand along the frame and succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check. A character who knows Abyssal can determine the passphrase with a DC 15 Intelligence check, though sometimes the passphrase is more difficult to discover and a clever carver may hide it in a riddle within the runes. Dealing 50 damage to the door's frame renders the trap inert until it is repaired. The AC for the doorframe depends on the material of which it is made (wood AC 15, stone AC 17, metal AC 19).",
				"Any non-fiend creature who walks through the door triggers the trap. The creature is transported into a random area of the Abyss and witnesses unspeakable horror. That creature must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save it takes 55 ({@dice 10d10}) psychic damage. On a success it takes half damage. The creature returns on the side of the doorframe from which it entered at the end of its next turn."
