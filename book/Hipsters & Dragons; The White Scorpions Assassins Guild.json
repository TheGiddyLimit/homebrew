They strike so swiftly and retreat so rapidly that sightings are rare, whilst the handful of assassins who've been caught in centuries of operation have committed suicide before talking, or being put on public trial.",

In the service of the god Tyr - whom they worship as Arrtyr, Judge of All - they offer revenge to the needy and powerless, and deal justice to the corrupt and unpunished.",

Once a decision has been made, one of the Order's deadly agents is dispatched to do the deed.",

								"According to their own lore and legend, The Order of the White Scorpions was founded around 500 DR by a man named Tai Yehia from Chondath. The Order's historians, writing many years after the events, state that Yehia was a slave of unknown origin who rose to prominence as the accountant of House Balaguer whilst still a youth. Such was the esteem that he was held in by his masters that after nearly two decades of loyal service Yehia was able to buy his freedom. As a freeman he started his own successful trading firm and married the beautiful daughter of a Chondathian merchant. However the beauty of his new wife inspired envy in an arrogant local lord by the name of Oriol. Oriol first seduced Yehia's wife and then had Yehia himself arrested and exiled on false charges.",
								"Scared that death would follow exile, Yehia fled first to The Shaar and then to Estagund, where he visited a long since ruined shrine of Arrtyr and prayed for vengeance. The God of Justice told him to travel as far as Shou Lung on the other side of Toril and look for the sigil of a black scorpion. After searching many months and following countless clues to dead ends, he finally found such a sigil on the gate of a monastery that he chanced upon whilst trying to cross the Kokaha Steppes. This monastery to a dying foreign deity was manned by a solitary monk of ancient years, who trained Yehia in the arts of stealth, poison and weaponry, without ever saying a word to him. After five years of training the monk died, at which point Yehia embarked on his long homeward journey.",
								"By the time he set foot back in Chondath he had been away nearly ten years. He discovered that his wife had had miscarried what he believed to be his child and then died giving birth five years later to his usurper's child. Using the techniques he had perfected in the steppes of Shou Lung, Yehia killed Oriol in an act of vengeance, and kidnapped his son, Jadyn. He then founded the White Scorpions, chiselling the Order's Three Maxims into a stone tablet to be passed through the ages, and training Jadyn to carry on his work.",
								"Jadyn, under the tuition of his new step father, became a fanatic of the Order and its next leader. He assumed the name The Just Hand and began to recruit a band of apprentices with the goal of terrorising corruption and evil wherever they found it. They say he never knew his true identity.",
								"For centuries the guild's mission, together with its secrets and techniques, were successfully passed down to new members; at least until the year 1014 DR when Grandmaster White Claw carried out the assassination of the leader of a powerful criminal faction known as The Goldfellows. The new leader of The Goldfellows, a ruthless warlord with sorcerer's powers by the name of Xhakaan, relentlessly sought out and killed all of the Order he could find in a retaliation designed to assuage fears and build his reputation. After White Claw fell victim to Xhakaan's full blooded offensive, the few remaining Scorpions, leaderless and decimated, were forced to go into hiding.",
								"Scared and isolated, but defiant, these survivors continued to hold true to their beliefs and keep the Order alive, albeit inactive in practice and without a central command. Around 1250 DR the Order truly started to recover under the leadership of Grandmaster Moonlight Creed, whilst today the tireless work of long-serving Grandmaster Oblivion is finally coming to fruition. With every year that passes, more and more evil-doers feel the steel and poison of the Order, and today the White Scorpions are more powerful than ever before.",

As well as disabling the target for the kill, this paralysing effect allows the Scorpion agent to read aloud a list of the victim's misdemeanours, so that they are fully aware that they are being assassinated for their crimes against justice. The last words the victim are likely to hear are the guild's motto: {@i Let the Gods judge whom the Scorpions bury}.

It takes one day to harvest one highly concentrated dose from a single scorpion, and to harvest this dose you must coerce the live scorpion into expressing its poison four times over 24 hours.

Trainees are taught to read and write the common tongue, if they don't already know how to, and well as given a good grounding in history, religion and natural lore so that they can assimilate into any level of society.

Run the adventure where the group are roped into rescuing a captured White Scorpion agent and then forced to swear vows of silence after what they've seen. And then in the next adventure it's time to trace the true story of the sorcerer's tiefling heritage, find the ranger's lost uncle, or protect the barbarian's village.
