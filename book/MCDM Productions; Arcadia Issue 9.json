						"Reading and playing other roleplaying games makes us better Game Masters and players because it improves our design skills. In some way, all players, including GMs, are game designers. If you have created a world, adventure, encounter, magic item, monster, feat, spell, puzzle, or trap, you're a game designer. If you've ever made up a rule because you didn't like how the official one worked, it didn't exist, or you just didn't feel like taking the time to look it up, you did a little game design, my friend. If you've proposed a new use of one of your character's skills, spells, or traits to your GM or created your own background by taking the skills from one, the tool proficiencies of a second, and the feature of a third, you are 100 percent designer. Heck, if you created your character's personality traits, ideal, bond, and flaw from scratch, then let me be the first to welcome you to the game design club. You'll love it here. We have snacks.",
						"One person strengthening those design chops provides a richer experience for everyone at the table. Just like trying new recipes makes you a better cook, experiencing other games increases your skill and understanding of game design and makes you a better player.",
						"When you interact with a lot of different games, you learn to design toward different goals and styles of play. For instance, the world's oldest roleplaying game is built around battling monsters, which is why a majority of a character's class features and most of a creature's stat block are dedicated to combat. If you pick up a game like {@link Bubblegumshoe|https://www.evilhat.com/home/bubblegumshoe/}, which is about teen detectives in the modern world investigating crimes, you can see the rules are centered around solving mysteries in a way that a game about battling monsters isn't. After reading just a few pages of {@link Dusk City Outlaws|https://scratchpadpublishing.com/dco-info}, you'll realize that the game is all about planning and pulling off heists, and that it gives you great tools to do so.",
						"You can and likely will have investigations and heists in the world's oldest roleplaying game, the same way you can have combat in Bubblegumshoe and Dusk City Outlaws, but each system executes all of these elements with various levels of depth and satisfaction. When you read and play other games, you can introduce the concepts and mechanics from one into the other, and you gain a deeper understanding of how games work. The more games you experience, the easier it becomes to absorb new rules and parse the motivations behind them.",
						"If time, money, and finding players is a concern, you should know that most RPGs out there don't require three core rulebooks (some are {@link one page|https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/337120/Mundane-Magic-RPG}), many RPGs have {@link free or reduced-cost versions|https://www.faterpg.com/2013/the-new-era-of-fate-is-here/} or {@link reduced-price starter sets|https://cityofmist.co/collections/sets/products/the-starter-box}, and {@link a lot of people are willing to try a game as a one-shot if a friend offers to teach them|https://app.roll20.net/forum/category/22}. You can also do what I do and seek out new games at conventions (online and in-person), which always feature a GM eager to teach folks their favorite system.",
						"Players and designers often turn to other RPGs when we want to do something in a game that the rules don't currently allow. Matt and I both wanted to see rules for level-0 characters in ARCADIA because we both enjoy low-powered play. When {@link Chris Bissette|https://twitter.com/pangalactic} pitched an article for level-0 rules inspired by the funnels of {@link Dungeon Crawl Classics|https://goodman-games.com/dungeon-crawl-classics-rpg/}, {@link MÖRK BORG|https://morkborg.com/}, {@link Troika!|https://www.troikarpg.com/}, and {@link Mothership|https://www.mothershiprpg.com/}, I knew that we were creating something special, because those games are fantastic and Chris is one of the best designers out there. Combine that article with {@link Sally Tamarkin's|https://twitter.com/sallyt} new backgrounds and collaborative settingbuilding guide and {@link Mario Ortegón's|https://twitter.com/elwarius} flavorful and innovative subclasses, and we've got one of the best issues of this magazine yet.",

She followed in their traditions by climbing the ranks of the faith of the Sentinel, a deity of vigilance and protection, and became a revered shield-priest as soon as she came of age. After decades of duty, the prestigious Order of the Everguard recruited Misiri and charged her with the protection of Empress Nebrala II.",
								"Years later, after two encroaching nations moved in to occupy their lands, Misiri saw war decimate her kingdom. Empress Nebrala refused to negotiate with the invaders and sought a way to defeat the invading forces. She found an ancient dwarven spell scroll that could open a rift to the Plane of Earth to raise a mountain from the ground.",
								"During the siege of their last remaining stronghold, the empress ordered Misiri to cast the spell, but the shield-priest refused to endanger the people of the citadel. Furious at her insubordination, the empress had Misiri arrested and took the scroll to cast the spell herself. As the guards seized her, Misiri witnessed in terror as rising crags tore through the citadel, ending hundreds of lives in a matter of seconds. In an act of desperation, she broke free from the hold of the guards, took her sword, and ended her empress's life, halting the spell. Though her actions saved thousands, Misiri was branded a traitor to the kingdom and earned the contempt of her god.",
								"Now Misiri wanders as an outcast, carrying her fractured shield at her back but never wielding it. As the subject of the Sentinel's scorn, she has learned to turn the doom of her god's ire against others, carving a new path for herself as an anathematic cleric in order to survive."

After a literal stab in the back from his supposed allies, quick-thinking Rucio gave the traitors his canteen and kept the magic {@item iron flask} as they left him for dead. On the brink of death, he opened the flask and released a powerful pit fiend, who offered him a chance to live by making a warlock pact.",
								"Bolstered by infernal power, Rucio hunted the turncoats down and moved on to become a renowned adventurer. But the more fame and fortune he found, the more his patron demanded. Rucio spent years covertly searching for a way to get ahead of his patron and regain his freedom.",
								"Finally, after nearly a decade, Rucio found a book containing his patron's true name. Invoking it, he summoned the pit fiend and demanded two things: that the devil forget him, and that it return to the {@item iron flask}. The pit fiend complied, but only after almost killing Rucio again and snatching the book away from him.",

						"This quote elegantly captures why I love cities so much\u2014and, more importantly for this article, why I think they're the perfect setting for telling stories about political intrigue. Before I get to that, let me say this first: campaigns about political intrigue can be tricky, mainly because when it comes to getting players (and their characters) invested, such campaigns tend to lack the do-this-and-save-the-worldplease quality of traditional arcs and campaigns. Those campaigns have the advantage of immediately setting the stakes sky-high, which means that players know their characters will get to be heroes or die trying\u2014two very cool outcomes.",
						"Stories of political intrigue tend to be smaller and are, by definition, quieter since intrigue basically means \"engaging in secret schemes.\" In fact, the characters might want to ensure that no one ever discovers they were involved at all! The good news is that political intrigue campaigns are all about mystery and discovery, about keeping and telling secrets, and about using your wits (and, okay, maybe your blade) to get what you want\u2014which means that with some thoughtful design, they can be thrilling and fun.",
						"This is where cities come in. Cities are, as the quote above says, full of strangers, which makes them the perfect place to tell stories about all kinds of NPCs and factions plotting, in secret, to take what they want\u2014money or territory, or maybe power, influence, or control. And if you build your city around these NPCs, it will feel alive and lived-in, a place where people scheme secretly, where a thieves' guild works with a city leader to shake down the local nobles; where the mayor is in cahoots with a local religious leader for some dark purpose; where the head of the city watch is conspiring with an artificer from the local tinkerer's guild to make illegal magic weapons.",
						"On a more practical level, any city\u2014real or fictional\u2014has the building blocks of a political intrigue campaign. First, cities are densely populated with residents of various backgrounds and livelihoods, whose lives are intertwined through work, proximity, romance, shared interest, rivalries, and so on. Second, cities have a system of governance\u2014an entity that holds (and generally seeks to maintain) state power, which of course means there are people or groups that seek to take away that power. Finally, cities are home to various factions competing for attention, control, and influence. Sometimes this takes the form of competition for some kind of officially recognized or \"legitimate\" power, as with elections, labor disputes, or matters of succession. Other times, the power that is sought is informal or perhaps even criminal\u2014maybe two thieves' guilds fighting over territory, a religious leader seeking to influence local law using bribery, or a city leader using their station to illegally accumulate wealth.",
						"This article includes a step-by-step guide to creating and developing a city perfect for a political intrigue campaign.

								"Particularly if you're using the backgrounds in this article, I recommend building your city in three phases. The first phase takes place before your session zero. In fact, session zero is the time you will present the city to your players. In this phase of design you're going to come up with some basic details about your city so that it feels like a real place to you and to your players, but is not so complete and built out that your players aren't sure where their characters would fit into it. Again, political intrigue campaigns require that the players care about the city and that their characters feel invested in what goes on there. In my experience, the best way to facilitate this is to think of character creation as part of your worldbuilding and vice versa. So, let's start building the version of our city that we want to bring to our session zero.",

												"I'm going to build a small city with a population of 11,000. Although cities can be dense, sprawling, or anything in between, I want this one to be very densely populated; about a three-quarters of a mile in length and width. To support a crowded population, many buildings in the city are several stories tall, with some top floors added to older structures as the settlement grew. One of my favorite things about cities in real life and in fiction is that when they're densely populated, people can't help but be characters in one another's lives, and that's perfect for political intrigue stories. I also really like when cities have distinct neighborhoods, so I'm going to break this one up into quadrants; the river will divide the city in two and the bridge will bisect it again. I know I'll want my city's criminal organizations to each operate out of a different district, so I'll make a note of that and return to it later. I also want there to be a district that's based around the city's key industry.",

I'll name my city Woodbridge, after the wooden bridge that was built by the city's founders so they didn't have to ford the river. The wide river is a huge source of employment and income for the city. Considering how important the river is, I'll call one of the four districts the Fresh Water. This will be the northwest quadrant of the city, home to fisheries, boatyards, and all the people who work with the river and its bounty. You always know you're in the Fresh Water because your boots are caked with mud and the smell of trout is in the air.",
												"Across the bridge from the Fresh Water is a district called Bankside, an upscale residential neighborhood. If the Fresh Water is the industrial side of the bridge, Bankside is more like a luxe riverside community. Each home has a slip at the Woodbridge marina where their pleasure craft is docked, waiting to whisk its owners and their guests away on a sunset tour of the river. The only aroma on this side of the river is the sweet fragrance of the local fruit trees, which bloom every spring and draw visitors from all over town.",

Finally, across the bridge from Fairmarket, in the southwest quadrant, is the Spit. This area is full of dive bars, a couple of underground fight clubs, and cheap inns, as well as some disreputable shops and vendors that offer rare goods of dubious legality."

She followed in their traditions by climbing the ranks of the faith of the Sentinel, a deity of vigilance and protection, and became a revered shield-priest as soon as she came of age. After decades of duty, the prestigious Order of the Everguard recruited Misiri and charged her with the protection of Empress Nebrala II.",
				"Years later, after two encroaching nations moved in to occupy their lands, Misiri saw war decimate her kingdom. Empress Nebrala refused to negotiate with the invaders and sought a way to defeat the invading forces. She found an ancient dwarven spell scroll that could open a rift to the Plane of Earth to raise a mountain from the ground.",
				"During the siege of their last remaining stronghold, the empress ordered Misiri to cast the spell, but the shield-priest refused to endanger the people of the citadel. Furious at her insubordination, the empress had Misiri arrested and took the scroll to cast the spell herself. As the guards seized her, Misiri witnessed in terror as rising crags tore through the citadel, ending hundreds of lives in a matter of seconds. In an act of desperation, she broke free from the hold of the guards, took her sword, and ended her empress's life, halting the spell. Though her actions saved thousands, Misiri was branded a traitor to the kingdom and earned the contempt of her god.",
				"Now Misiri wanders as an outcast, carrying her fractured shield at her back but never wielding it. As the subject of the Sentinel's scorn, she has learned to turn the doom of her god's ire against others, carving a new path for herself as an anathematic cleric in order to survive."

After a literal stab in the back from his supposed allies, quick-thinking Rucio gave the traitors his canteen and kept the magic {@item iron flask} as they left him for dead. On the brink of death, he opened the flask and released a powerful pit fiend, who offered him a chance to live by making a warlock pact.",
				"Bolstered by infernal power, Rucio hunted the turncoats down and moved on to become a renowned adventurer. But the more fame and fortune he found, the more his patron demanded. Rucio spent years covertly searching for a way to get ahead of his patron and regain his freedom.",
				"Finally, after nearly a decade, Rucio found a book containing his patron's true name. Invoking it, he summoned the pit fiend and demanded two things: that the devil forget him, and that it return to the {@item iron flask}. The pit fiend complied, but only after almost killing Rucio again and snatching the book away from him.",
				"Rucio's gambit was successful: he kept his patron's power and freed himself from the devil's demands. In doing so, however, he became the target of an incessant hunt from cultists, warlocks, and devils seeking to retrieve the {@item iron flask} with the pit fiend and powerful book of names trapped inside.
