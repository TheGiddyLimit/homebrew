				"This spell plays upon the deep psychological and physiological revulsion towards certain objects that some creatures possess, If the targeted creature fails its Wisdom saving throw, it becomes convinced that the focus item the caster presents is its allergen. How it reacts depends on the creature's personality, how strong its aversion is, and how threatening the caster chooses to be. If The allergen fascinates the subject, enrages it or prevents it from approaching (like garlic to a vampire), then that takes effect nor-mally. If the allergen would normally kill the creature (as wolfsbane does to a werewolf), then the creature must make a Wisdom saving throw or become fright-ened of the item for as long as it can see it. Particu-larly aggressive creatures that succeed at the saving throw may attack, however, trying to wrest the illusory allergen away from the caster. Once the spell ends, the subject's senses return to normal, If they can still see (or otherwise sense) the focus, they realize that the caster has made a fool of them, If not, they may continue to believe that the caster still possesses their allergen. This spell can be used against lycanthropes, vampires, any ghost or ancient dead that has an aller-gen due to some salient power, and any other crea-ture that has a chemical vulnerability or crippling reac-tion to an object of some kind. People with unnaturally strong phobias can also be {@condition frightened} by the allergen."

				"This spell enables a living caster to merge their mind with the body of an undead monster or an undead caster to merge their mind with the body of a living humanoid creature. The caster must target this spell on a living humanoid creature if the caster is undead or an undead creature if the caster is alive. A target that is not a human receives a +2 bonus to their saving throw against this spell. If the saving throw succeeds, the spellcaster is forced back into their original body. If the target's saving throw fails, the spellcaster joins their mind with the target's body. While in the target's body, the caster can use all of the victim's special abilities except memorized spells. Meanwhile, the spell-caster's body remains {@condition incapacitated} and vulnerable to attacks. Once in the target's body, the spellcaster can travel any distance as long as they remain in the same domain as their true body. Once in the target's body, a living caster makes the undead feel as if they were alive again while an undead caster fills the target's mind with ghastly thoughts. At the beginning of each hour during the joining, if the target is a living creature, it must attempt a madness check. Failure means that the undead caster's mind overcomes that of the vic-tim, no further checks are necessary and the undead spellcaster can remain in control of their mortal victim effortlessly for the duration of the spell. A successful madness check means that the undead spellcaster must roll a DC 15 saving throw to remain in the body. If the check succeeds, the mental battle goes on. If it fails, the undead creature's mind is cast from the body, and the victim regains control. However, a target who successfully ejects the undead spellcaster from their body gains a long term madness.  One interesting side effect of the frightful joining is that while in the mortal body, the caster can do things that cannot be done in their own undead body. For example, a vampiric caster can walk in the sunlight and see their reflection in a mirror."

				"This spell enables the necromancer to create an undead, golem like monster composed of up to three dead bodies. The caster can choose these parts from any selection of dead animals, humanoids, or mon-sters, as long as they span no more than two size cat-egories. For example, the caster could meld a giant boar and an elf, since one is Large and the other is Medium. However, the caster cannot not meld a rat and an elf since the rat is Tiny which is more than one size category different from the elf. Similarly, the caster could not meld a Small, a Medium, and a Large crea-ture. Also, none of the creatures melded together can have more than 5 Hit Dice. The advantage of the meld is that the caster can use various attributes from which-ever of the original creatures used them best though the monster will always have animal Intelligence. Most attributes are associated with a particular piece of the creature's body, which must be used in the meld. At least one attribute must be taken from each creature in the meld. The created monster will always loyally serve its creator. The created monster inherits four attributes from the original creatures: Hit Dice, Armor Class, movement rate and attacks. The monster's armor class becomes the AC of the creature that had the highest, its type is changed to undead and it has advantage to turning undead attempts. The caster can derive the monster's movement rates from multiple creatures as long as they choose only one movement rate per crea-ture per medium (running, swimming, flying, burrowing etc.). The ability scores of the created creature uses the stats of the original creatures in any combination but in accordance to the parts of the creatures used. Constitution score comes from the creature that grants the creation its total hit dice, Strength comes from the creature that gave its arms, Dexterity comes from the creature that gave its legs and speed, Wisdom, Intelli-gence and Charisma is always 8(-1). The caster must transfer the number of attacks per round from a single creature but can give their creation attack forms from any or all of the creatures in the meld. The creature will often have more attack forms than its parts normal-ly have. The appropriate body part for the attack form must exist in the meld. Most physical attacks can be re-tained, including poison, paralysis, web spinning, and breath weapons. Magical or mental powers do not survive the transition into undeath. This includes gaze at-tacks, spellcasting, magic resistance, immunity to non-magical weapons, spell-like abilities, a lycanthrope's cursed bite, etc. One of Strahd's favorite melds is a werewolf, large spider,and gargoyle. This foul creature uses the gargoyle's flying movement and the spider's ground movement. (Even though a werewolf is faster than the spider, he can only pick the legs of one of them and therefore cannot have web movement if he uses the lycanthrope's legs). The Hit Dice are drawn from the werewolf. which has {@dice 9d8} Hit Dice. The Armor Class of 15 is taken from the gargoyle, as are the num-ber of attacks (2). The creature gets the werewolf's bite and the spider's poison and web-spinning abili-ty. Visually, the abomination has spider legs, a were-wolf body and head, and gargoyle wings and arms."

When he perished in battle with the Sorcerer-Fiend Gwydion, Maeve pulled the items through the gate. After the shadow elves had reached Ravenloft, Maeve and Loht presented the pieces to the princes and princesses of each of the Nine Breeds as a sign of office. Maeve retained the crown and Loht the sword, as tokens of their own status as Princess of the Shee and Prince of the Sith respectively. Recently, however, Loht has been gathering the regalia together again. Like Maeve, Loht is aware that uniting the regalia is the key to operate the Obsidian Gate, but she naively does not realize this is actually his plan. Once all nine pieces are in his possession, he plans to open the portal.",
					"Loht now possesses eight of the nine items he needs; only the {@item Crown of Arak|Darklords&DomainsVol1} is missing, hidden by Maeve somewhere within the Malachite Palace. If Loht, or some other person, was able to recover these items, terrible things would be sure to happen.",

				"Distilled from the umbral weed of Ghastria, Umbral gray can be used both as a paint with a smokey grey colour and as a deadly poison. The poison can only be delivered through ingestion but the substance's strong taste can be detected easily by creatures with a passive perception of 13 or higher. When mixed with carrion crawler venom, the taste goes away and cannot be detected. The method of concealment is known only by Marquis Stezen d'Polarno and Baron Camar D'Marosso. The poison needs 5 minutes to take effect. A creature subjected to this poison must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned and lose 1d6 Constitution damage per minute. The creature rerolls the saving throw at the end of every minute for the next 5 minutes and ends the effect on a success. Another way was discovered by the inventful Marquis. Even though the skin is usually strong enough to withstand the effects of umbral grey, when exposed for a prolonged period of time (5 hours) then the pigment can still eat into the skin, painting it grey at first and then attacking vital organs. In this state, the poison once again has the same effects associated with umbral grey but the victim is not allowed a saving throw. Also, if the poison is neutralized, it still leaves the skin permanently colored gray. A favorite pastime of d'Polarno is to find someone he particularly does not like during a party, restrain or knock the person unconscious, and slowly apply paint over their naked body and watch them wither away until they die."

At first the Borcan order thought Renthon was a font of holy power, but he soon descended into hubris and madness. Renthon demanded to be the head of the order, and was forced to flee the wrath of angry monks.",

As night fell Renthon was visited by the Prince of Twilight. The Prince talked to Renthon, telling him how every mortal had been cheated and damaged years ago. Mortals used to possess two souls. The Prince told Renthon how to summon his other soul from the beyond, and instructed the cleric to write his instructions down. Renthon disappeared shortly after the Grand Conjunction, leaving over 1,000 copies of the text in his house."

								"The Shadow Rift was once known as Arak, and lay to the south of Darkon, though most of its inhabitants lived underground, and were presumed to be drow. Since then the domain has disappeared and the Shadow Rift has formed in its place. Scholars have since then, also discovered that the Arak are not drow elves-like the inhabitants of both Barovia, Darkon, and beyond, believed, but are instead fey creatures, some of whom resemble elves with dusky skin. Not much is known of Arak before the Grand Conjunction - the inhabitants lived underground and kept to themselves. Anyone who ventured there risked being captured and dragged into the underworld, never to be seen again.",
								"In many ways, the same state of affairs applies still, but since the appearance of the Shadow Rift, fey creatures have become far more common in the lands surrounding the domain, and scholars have been able to deduce much from the information gleaned from the creatures, somewhat able to piece together what lies within the Rift.",
								"The Shadow Rift is a fey land that, despite having no sun, is lush with vegetation half the time, and a winter wasteland the other half. And above it all rolls the Mists, keeping any natural sunlight out. And that is probably for the best, at least from the viewpoint of the Arak, as sunlight is deadly to all of them.",
								"The Arak themselves are somewhat of a misnomer, as unlike in other lands, the Arak consist of at least nine different races of fey, all of whom have influence in either the Seelie or the Unseelie Court. And all of them owe allegiance to the Law of Arak.",
								{

									}
								},
								"To look at the history of the Shadow Rift briefly is almost impossible, but in ages past, Gwydion the Sorcerer-Fiend held huge numbers of fey in thrall on the Plane of Shadow. They were treated as no better than slaves, and eventually one among their number, Arak the Erlking rose up and led the fey in rebellion. But Gwydion was too powerful, and finally the slaves tried to escape. They opened a portal to what later became Arak (named in the Erlking's honor), but Gwydion was right behind them. Arak stood his ground, sent his children to lead the escapees, and fought Gwydion in a stalling effort to hold him off before the gate closed. As the gate closed, Gwydion was caught and imprisoned. And so he has remained for five millennia, stuck in the Obsidian Gate, and should he break free, he'd find himself in a slightly larger prison, but one that would be equally difficult to escape.",
								"The fey meanwhile have been ruled by Arak's children, Queen Maeve and Prince Loth, ever  while his name has been immortalized in both the naming of the inhabitants of Arak (all the fey living here refer to themselves as Arak, though they may be very different creatures) as well as the name of the domain before the Grand Conjunction.",
								"Finally, there is the Law of Arak, again named after the Erlking. It is universally obeyed by everyone within the domain, but simply put, it states that \"No Arak may kill another Arak\", in defiance of Gwydion's callousness. It is such a respected law that even those who harm another Arak or who are so much as suspected of murder can be found guilty of breaking it. Ironically the most grievous breach of the law was the killing of Tristessa by Loht, for following the Spider Queen, one of the religions outlawed in the Shadow Rift, due to its use of living sacrifices. Breaking the law is punishable by exile (for Arak/fey creatures) or execution (for non-fey creatures).",
								"Then there is the issue of time within the Shadow Rift. Time here passes much faster than in the surrounding domains. A year here is only a fortnight in the outside world. It is therefore dangerous to mortals, even if they're simply visiting the place and never run into a single inhabitant. This has also led the otherwise im-mortal fey to be fascinated with mortals and the passing of time. To them, the mortals disappear in but a short time, and their desperate fight to make an impact in the world before they die is endlessly interesting to the immortals.",
								"Adventures in the Shadow Rift should focus on dualities, whether that is the fight between good and evil (or at least evil vs. everything else), the passage of time within and outside of the Shadow Rift, or the clash between mortal and immortal. All of these should serve as a foundation for, or at least play a part in any adventure in the Shadow Rift. Perhaps the heroes are looking for a specific fey that has placed a curse on a friend, or they're looking for a way to fight an ancient evil that the fey might have encountered in the past, and therefore have knowledge of. Most worryingly, perhaps the heroes are looking for a way to leave, and have heard of the Obsidian Gate. Opening the Gate would unleash Gwydion, even if the heroes should manage to escape.",

										"Like the plants (as described below) the animals of the Shadow Rift are different from those of other lands. While the flowers and plants are more \"alive\", the animals are, in some cases, quite literally MORE. Giant versions of the animals abound here, some are known to walk on their hind legs and use tools (though they seem no more intelligent than their normal counterparts - either that or mortals simply haven't found a way to communicate with them yet), while others are twisted with horned protrusions or powerful claws, even extra limbs. These are often termed \"dire\" animals in other domains, but here, they are completely normal, to the point where those animals that aren't twisted in some way are the exception. Vermin and bugs are common as well, especially spiders and spider-like monsters - this poses a problem for the local Arak population who hate the creatures, and have been driven to the very edges of the Stonedowns. Perhaps this proliferation of spiders is a contributing factor to why the people of the domains surrounding Arak thought that the Arak were drow and not a form of fey. In spite of having been driven to the edges of the Stonedowns however, they breed with such speed that they frequently invade Arak lands and have to be driven back."

										"To describe the flora of the Shadow Rift is near impossible. Basically, anything and everything grows here, but it does so in a peculiar manner. Firstly, it only grows in the Greenlands. The Stonedowns are only home to the Stonedowns moss. Secondly, there is no sunlight in the rift, as it is all blocked by the Mists swirling above, but even in this twilight zone life flourishes. Every plant is somehow more than those found elsewhere. Roses are far more vivid in their colors, but their thorns are sharper and larger. Trees grow larger, though they're interspersed with abandon, and it isn't unusual to see oak trees growing next to bamboo, which in turn grows next to a palm tree and a fir. While all plants grow here (from ones that are perfectly safe to ones that are incredibly ravenous), there is a proliferation of those plants that are known for their colors or their smells, such as roses, hyacinth, lilies, and orchids. It's almost as if the very nature of the Shadow Rift is conducive to these more vivid plants (in all aspects), and that it draws them here to break the monotony of the immortal life of the Rift's inhabitants."

Fey creatures of all kinds can be found here: pixies, nymphs, sidhe, satyrs, dryads, the arak, and so on. The ruling classes are those of the arak and the sidhe (or sith) however, as they lord over the rest of the creatures that make the Shadow Rift their home. While these are relatively easy for the people around the domain to catch and recognize, the changelings are a different matter. They can appear as completely human, and the other fey of the Shadow Rift take a devilish delight in stealing children from the other domains and replacing them with changelings. Of course, some of the evil fey simply dispose of these children, but in many cases the neutral or good ones let them live out their lives in the Shadow Rift - unfortunately, due to the way time passes in the Shadow Rift, their families never see them again, as they'll pass full lifetimes in mere weeks, while the rest of the world crawls on around them. Meanwhile, the changelings take their place, and for this reason are often outcasts - at least when they are discovered, which often happens around puberty when changelings lose control of their powers for a year or so, going through random transformations into forms they've taken or admired. This only adds to the already sinister reputation of the Shadow Rift of course, especially in Tepest which suffers the worst of the depredations - probably simply due to how much easier it is for the fey to enter that domain."

To the outside world, the Shadow Rift appears as a truly massive canyon or valley - almost literally a hole in the ground. This hole is filled with mist and fog so thick as to be almost solid, and it is impossible to see through.

No such event has been registered however.",

The Northern Rift is the home of the Greenlands, an area that is lush with life and plants. It is relatively flat, broken up by only five plateaus on which a visitor can find ruins of lost civilizations. These are seemingly interspersed from all ages of history and from all over the multiverse. All in one gigantic jumble of mixes, so it's not unusual to find austere marble temples filled with columns standing right next to an enormous pyramid even though these would never normally coincide. The Southern Rift is dominated by the Stonedowns. Unlike the Greenlands, the Stonedowns is anything but flat, dominated by hills, crags, and deep chasms. It's mostly devoid of life, but that is not the case with the Black Marsh. It has life, but it is something far worse. In between the rifts is a 500 foot set of cliffs known as the Precipice. The Falling River takes the steep drop constantly, ending in the Biting Tarn at the very edge of the Stonedowns."

They are still intelligent and still feel pain, so when the fey trim and prune the hedges, the air is filled with cries of pain and shouts pleading for mercy, while blood bubbles forth from the new cuts. Thankfully, only new cuts react in this manner, saving the sanity of those traversing the maze.

It sits atop the Darkenheights, in the Stonedowns, at the peak of 2,500 feet. It is nearly impossible to get to, as the slopes are dangerous and spiders and undead creatures of all kinds patrol the mountain. Furthermore, the veil between the Shadow Rift and the Plane of Shadow is very thin here, and creatures on either side of the veil can interact with each other, though they cannot pass through. The gate itself is a globe of shadow (not entirely unlike a sphere of annihilation) that floats in the air above a winding spiral staircase. And only with the Regalia is it possible to open it.

They're led by Queen Maeve who has her great hall here, where she spends time when not in the Malachite Palace. The city is filled with music, both that which is played by the shee bards who perform here (and use the echo of the natural cavern that Esmerth lies in to their advantage), but the many pools in Esmerth add their own bubbling and rushing counterpoint to the music. The pools all flow into a vast lake at the center of town, at the foot of Maeve's Summer Palace. The palace itself is a tribute to the queen, a way to show her wit, beauty, and majesty to all visitors, though for the time where it is empty, it feels cold, silent, and strangely alien. Perhaps this impression of the queen is more accurate than most would like to consider, but the fey have named the palace with some humor, as it is during the spring and summer of the Shadow Rift, that Maeve is in attendance at the Malachite Palace. Esmerth is home to music of all kinds and boasts several bardic colleges (often filled with mortals who'd been lured here by the shee, and who never want to leave), all of whom teach music. Some also teach history, but while the shee are meticulous lore keepers, their race's history is entirely orally preserved, which has led to some... creative... changes at times."

								"Arkandale, like its eventual conqueror, was the realm of the man-beast. It sat in the northern part of the domain that is now Verbrek, and used to be roughly twice its present size, but was absorbed by Verbrek in the Grand Conjunction. Arkandale was not civilized, with hamlets and villages clustered around the Musarde River. The villages traded in furs and the plentiful meat of game, but none had any interest really in growing the size of their settlements. There were no roads, and trade and movement happened almost exclusively on the Musarde River and its tributaries, as they were the safest option. The forests were rife with wolves and werewolves (as well as other, smaller predators), making life and travel in the domain dangerous for the unprepared.",
								"Adventures in Arkandale should focus on the loss of freedom that Nathan feels. They should, despite of the connection with the Musarde, feel trapped. As if they cannot escape. Most heroes would have little reason to visit Arkandale, but there are plenty of opportunities for passing through the domain, mainly due to the riverways offered by the Musarde. Perhaps they're moving across the Core, and find themselves in need of a ship's captain after their first one is killed by werewolves. And who better than the famed Captain {@i Nathan Timothy}?",

It allowed trade to flow from Lamordia to Hazlan through its many byways and tributaries. Control of the river is highly regulated in most domains, but in Arkandale there was no such rule.

Nathan possessed a severe wanderlust from an early age and left the clan to wander the lands of the Core when he was barely in his teens. Nathan moved from domain to domain hunting humans and slaughtering small villages as his whims drove him. He found a boat and began to travel the River Musarde, occasionally offering charters or dabbling in some river piracy.",

With the creation of Arkandale came Nathan's greatest curse. He could never leave his ship again. If he touched the shore he would be wracked with pain and slowly become weaker until he couldn't move. If he stayed on shore long enough he wouldn't have the strength to move at all, but would never die. Still, Nathan made the best of his life. He commanded his werewolf minions to attack any other boat on the river and slaughter the crew, and soon Nathan had the only ferry on the River Musarde. His rates were astronomical but everyone was forced to pay them. Priscilla died soon after his children were born, some say trying to escape her husband, and Nathan kidnapped a woman named Arabella. Nathan has turned her into a werewolf and controls her completely.",

								"Barovia, which straddles the highest peaks of the Balinok Mountains, is a harsh, rural territory enslaved by despotism and superstition. The Vistani call Barovia \"Anda Thema\" meaning both 'heart' and 'edge' of the world. The Balinoks, particularly the twin snow-capped summits of Mounts Baratok and Ghakis, dominate the scene. The mountains run through the middle of the realm like a jagged spine, expanding east and west to embrace the steep highlands on each side. The Balinoks, which are marked by rocky outcroppings and steep cliffs, are particularly dangerous. The ice and snow that clog mountain passes nine months of the year make travel much more dangerous. To the east and west, the narrow valleys that cut the Balinoks' slopes expand. Mountain streams rapidly become huge, powerful rivers that weave their way through the densely wooded dales. The Gundar, Luna, and Nharov Rivers to the west, and the Ivlis and Saniset Rivers to the east, all start their trek through the Core high in the Barovian Balinoks.",
								"The domain is dominated by old woods, with the exception of the highest slopes of Mounts Baratok and Ghakis, which are periodically interrupted by mossy meadows. Huge, screaming bats fill the skies at night, and monstrous wolves prowl the forests. Along the Old Svalich Road, Lake Zarovich, one of the biggest fresh-water lakes in the Core, is situated between Mounts Baratok and Ghakis. The only link between the eastern and western Cores south of the Shadow Rift is this roadway. Despite Barovia's forbidding environment, a remarkable number of merchants and pilgrims pass through the realm each summer, hurrying to cross the Balinoks before the Old Svalich closes in late fall.",
								"The majority of Barovia's buildings are made of brick and thick wood that has been plastered and painted a deep russet or light dun color. Rows of mineral-flecked stones embedded into the plaster decorate many homes and businesses. The steep thatched roofs have small leaden rose windows placed in the gables. Window boxes bloom with vibrant flowers in the spring, while pumpkin lanterns appear at harvest time to ward off evil's henchmen. The ring of continuous fog that surrounds the town of Barovia is one of the realm's most notable features. Although the winters in Barovia are long and harsh, the rest of the year is pleasant, with gentle precipitation and sundappled days. The ethnic Barovians, who have resided in the area for seven and a half centuries, have dominated Barovian culture. The Barovian populace constantly changes as the majority of the residents are soulless husks, created by the thoughts and mood of Strahd.",
								"Only a few actually possess a soul and they are doomed to reincarnate eternally. Balok, their language, is one of the most widely spoken languages in the southern Core. The Gundarakites are Barovia's second biggest ethnic group, having become second-class citizens (at best) after Strahd conquered nearby Gundarak during the Great Upheaval in 740 BC. The Gundarakites are an oppressed people who live mostly in the ruins of their old country in Barovia's west. There are also smaller tribes of Forfarians, descendants of Forlorn refugees when it was disclosed to Barovia in 550 BC, and Thaani, who fled over Barovia's southern border in 585 BC from the dreadful realm of Bluetspur. By refusing to marry ethnic Barovians, these two tiny groups have retained their identity. Finally, thanks to their alliance with the von Zarovich family, the Vistani have a sizable presence in Barovia. Although the Vistani are a nomadic race, specific tribes may always be found within Barovia's boundaries, as it is the safest area in the Core for them. Barovian society is mainly medieval, with the bulk of the population consisting of impoverished peasants and serfs who labor the von Zarovich family's farms under the careful eye of the local boyars. Small farmers, herders, and fishers are among the few who are free.",
								"The villages and cities, on the other hand, are a different story, with a plethora of artisans and merchants to be found. Barovians married at an early age, with males marrying at 16 and females marrying at 13, however they do not practice planned marriages. Widows and widowers are not allowed to divorce or remarry under their traditions. Due to the fact that many Barovians labor on farms, their families are often large, and women are expected to have as many children as they can. As a result, many mothers die during childbirth, and infant mortality during the first two years of life is significant. Barovians do not have access to formal education, and few, if any, are literate. Wealthy children are tutored privately or sent to study overseas. Because the hilly terrain is unsuitable for horseback riding, the majority of the journey is done on foot.",
								"As a result, the people of Barovia remain sedentary, with many of them never leaving their birth hamlet. The majority of the rivers are too dangerous for boating, but Lake Zarovich's deep waters have been a fishing paradise for generations. Regardless of their ethnic roots, the Barovian people all have one thing in common: a hatred of outsiders that borders on xenophobia. Their cold stares and lack of friendliness are the result of years of living under Count Strahd's strict rule. Barovians are unconcerned about the ways of others and prefer to mind their own business-which is generally just day-to-day survival.",
								"Every Barovian has a paralyzing dread of the supernatural. At nightfall, they lock all of the doors and windows in the house. They hold magic in the same respect that they hold superstition. Arcane magic, in particular, is thought to be a fiendish gift, and any reckless spellcaster in Barovia will almost certainly face an angry crowd. Count Strahd von Zarovich is the current ruler of Barovia, the latest in a long series of feudal dictators dating back generations. Locals refer to him as \"the Devil Strahd\", a harsh and remote ruler who seldom gets involved in the day-to-day (or possibly night-to-night) affairs of his kingdom. Strahd delegated local government to the boyars (noble landowners) and burgomasters (mayors), who can rule as they see appropriate.",
								"These small but desired positions of power are typically hereditary, although turnover is high owing to Count replacement (for incompetence, frailty, or insurrection) or mysterious deaths. The boyars and burgomasters' principal responsibility is to maintain a militia, for which they collect heavy taxes, despite the fact that Strahd himself does not demand regular payment from his people. Boyars and burgomasters help preserve the peace, select magistrates to settle civil disputes, and keep a watch on craft and commercial guilds that are ambitious. Humans are the most common race in Barovia, while half-Vistani constitute a distant second. Other races are exceedingly uncommon, but not unknown. Calibans appear in Barovia with alarming regularity, yet their births are just as often attributed to the influence of vampires, demons, or wizards as they are to hags. Halflings are only found in western Barovia's major settlements, where they reside in small ghettos. Wild elves are said to prowl the Tepurich Forest, while dwarves are said to live deep in the Balinoks or near the mining settlements. When rural Barovians come upon such nonhumans, they are prone to think of them as grotesque freaks or evil fey.",
								"The most prevalent classes in Barovia are clerics, warriors, rangers, rogues, and sorcerers. Even if they are not always trusted, clerics are renowned for their healing and prowess over the undead. Barovians revere the warrior's path, thus fighters and rangers are always paid their due. Rogues, dubbed scoundrels, are common, though they tend to limit their efforts to rural banditry rather than urban guild pursuits. For fear of retaliation from inquisitive peasants, sorcerers must keep their true nature hidden. Druids and wizards are both uncommon, but equally feared. Barovian bards are scarce, yet their melancholy songs and lullabies are popular. All save worshippers of the Morning Lord, who appreciate their goodness, if not their legal viewpoint, see Paladins as hopeless lunatics. Typically, the strange barbarian is a wild man who grew up amid creatures in the high highlands or a member of the remnants of the Neureni tribe who decided to wander off on their own.",

The forests and plains have red foxes, grey wolves, deers, elk, wild boar, otters, wild cats and brown bears prowling about. On the eastern side of Barovia, in the desert of the Hills of Bleak Vistas, as the Barovians know it, or the Howling Hills as the people of Nova Vaasa call it, stray Nova Vaasan lynxes and golden jackals are a common sight. Many of these animals are hunted for their fur.",
										"Barovia's rivers, lakes and ponds are home to many freshwater fish, most importantly, carp, trout, perch and bream. Some six species of sturgeon have been identified as living in Lake Zarovich. These swim up the Volgis river to spawn. Five of these sturgeon species are critically endangered, due to the efforts of the Mad Mage who fishes using the most unusual method of lightning strikes.",
										"A unique species of leech can be found at Lake Zarovich and Lake Luna. This particular leech has golden hair on its body and is quite aggressive. Spellcasters and Vistani collect these leeches and usually will pay up to 1gp for each specimen, their blood and golden hair being of use as spellcasting components.",
										"Barovians, most especially in Krezk, commonly keep goats, pigs, cows, horses and chickens. The Barovian chicken differs from the common hen. These chickens are larger than normal chickens, and alarmingly are mostly black, including their plumage, their beaks and their innards. Their eggs are pitch black, whilst the yolk is blood red.",
										"Vermin, such as rats, are not unknown in the larger settlements of the domain. The Barovians argue whether they need to keep the common cat (which is usually black) to get rid of the problem, or if they should shoo these cats away, as they believe that they either bring bad luck or are transformed Barovian witches.",
										"Every now and then, a traveler will notice that ravens or crows fly above their head and follow behind them. The superstitious Barovians believe that these birds act as spies for Strahd and most of the time it is true. Ravens on the other hand, are believed by the Vistani and the wereravens to help as guides through the mists for the wandering souls. Killing a raven in front of a Vistani would immediately curse the perpetrator, as their actions would doom hundreds of souls to be claimed by the mists forever. Another bird that is sacred to the Vistani, is the Vista-Chiri. Vista-Chiri follow Vistani caravans for reasons that not even the travellers can fathom. The Vistani are adept at reading their flight patterns and altering their travel routes according to the warnings or signs they get, making it all but impossible to surprise a troupe with the birds around. Raunie can even magically speak with them, making the Vista-Chiri highly effective information gatherers. Only the Raunie knows the real nature of these birds and they will never share the secret. Not even with other Vistani. The Vista-Chiri are the souls of departed Vistani that willingly reincarnated into the birds to act as helper to their former tribe."

										"Some of Barovia's pine trees have become what are known as 'Spine Trees'; pines that grow where piles of skeletal remains lie. The pines absorb the bones, giving them an odd bend and white sheen, so much that it looks as though the tree is covered in bones. Green glades flourish in the dales, where grasses and wildflowers thrive, fed by crystal streams during the warm months of the year. Barovians are deeply fond of the wild lilacs and daffodils that burst into life with every new spring.",
										"Some Barovian plants are highly prized by the Vistani. Bitterblot - a large green variety of Barovia's famed plum - has a slightly noticeable, relatively tannic pleasantness that prevents it from being grown widely. The Vistani utilize this fruit for divination. The Vistani seer will cut the fruit down the centre, dealing the most savage slash she can; if the pit breaks neatly in a single strike, it is considered a great omen. The fruit is a component of a malevolent Vistani curse, the poor subject of the curse gradually becoming a whining cripple. The Vistan's Tears, a sensitive bloom, bluebell shaped but with a dull white hue, is broadly accepted as the primary component in the Vistani's mythical healing elixir. Finally, Speckled Hydrangeas, often known as \"Vampire's Kiss\" are white Hydrangea flowers with a single red petal on each flower. Herbalists claim that making a properly balanced tea from the red petals of this plant can cause the imbiber to slip into a more easily persuaded state. The nobles and burgomasters of Vallaki are known as the main users of this tea and the Vistani love to overcharge a possible buyer. Other common flowers are the wolfsbane, mandragore, and the night roses which have a dark violet hue to their petals. Beware the Black Nightshade, poisonous to the touch, it is rumored to bring misfortune or even death to the hapless plucker.",
										"Barovia is the home of the legendary \"Bloodied Edelweiss\". Only one of these flowers blooms each year, and it can only be found near the peak of Mount Ghakis. Due to its rarity, the common folk do not believe in its existence. Legend has it that if it brewed into a peculiar concoction, it can cure lesser vampirism. Many Barovians hire adventurers to find a cure for their loved ones that become vampire spawn, yet, alas, the flower is so difficult to find that most adventurers freeze to death on the frozen slopes of the mountain. Around the settlements, creeper vines, ivy, black dahlia, black lotus and wild berries sprout. Occasionally, Barovian gardeners will find a flower in their garden that makes them doubt whether that flower is a living creature. The Snapdragon, as this flower is known, has bright colors and sweet fragrance-not to mention that when squeezed at its sides it resembles a dragon's mouth opening and closing. When it rots, the \"dragon's skull\" is left behind. Interestingly enough, the Vistani believe Snapdragons hold mystical powers, and that growing them in other people's gardens will protect them from curses and evil. Finally, sweet grapes are being grown to create the delicious wine that is Barovia's main export. Most notably, Purple Grapemash which is the cheapest variant, Red Dragon Crush and finally, the most expensive and delicious, Champagne du le Stomp."

Once fully matured, the heads fall from the tree, and float away, in search of the flesh of warm-blooded creatures. The heads moan as if true living beings, but these lamentations are but imitations of speech; the head can't truly communicate. The tree is believed to be of magical origin, and its wood is sometimes used by wizards and alchemists due to its anti-magical properties. The sap of the tree can be used as a material component for the antimagic field spell or be used as an ingredient to make a potion which, when someone drinks it, becomes unable to cast spells for 1 hour. Shackles made out of this tree's wood stop spellcasting and spell-like abilities but can easily be broken.",

An undead aboleth was trapped within the Lake Zarovich when the domain formed. It attracts spellcasters, usually Warlocks, promising them power and riches if they either find a way for it to escape or kill the Mad Mage of Mount Baratok, who plagues it with lightning bolts. The aboleth is far too fearful of Strahd to act and show its presence, preferring to stay idle at the bottom of the lake until it is time to take its freedom."

												"The Amber Temple was created a long time before Strahd's arrival in Prime Material Barovia. It was firstly built as a temple to store all dark secrets, abhorrent knowledge of spells and rituals as well as evil magic relics and vile heirlooms. Amber walls deny access to anyone who tries to teleport into the temple or walk into it through other planes. Scrying and other divination magic is also canceled by the amber. The temple's original purpose was to be a safe place meant to hide the dark knowledge and power from to-be evil-doers. Or so, the lesser ranking wizards, librarians, priests and members of the \"Keepers of Forbidden Lore\" thought. In reality, the temple was dedicated to none other than Vecna himself, who aimed to collect all secrets and dark knowledge of the cosmos. Sat on Ghakis Mountain, the temple is always surrounded by mounds of deathly cold ice. Any creature that tries to find and enter the temple without protection or a guide will be found in a state below freezing and facing the effects of extreme cold. Not many know the way to the temple, there are rumors that the Neureni barbarians and the druids of Yester Hill know the right path but convincing them to share that information would be a difficult task. Nothing lasts forever though, and the dark knowledge started corrupting the minds of the keepers, promising them an awakening that would ascend their powers even to the level of demi-gods.Eventually driven mad, they turned on each other. Many of them hid in secret chambers with as many papyri and scrolls as they could amass to study, eventually dying of starvation or self-inflicted wounds. Others were convinced to experiment and cast vile rituals, or even duel the other wizards, as a means to classify the potency of the spells, freeing demons and aberrations, transforming themselves to unspeakable horrors or outright killing each other. The few that resisted the taint managed to trap some of the freed dark entities into sarcophagi of amber and barricaded themselves in the areas where magic protection was at its peak. No protection can stop the human condition though, and the poor souls, driven mad by fear or anger, turned on each other.",

Now, it stands as an old prison, used to store the relics of evil of the past. Nobody remains to protect the knowledge and it is filled with the monstrosities that remain. The temple is now \"managed\", if one can claim that, by the amnesiac lich Exenthanter, who is happy to share the temple's forbidden secrets to all who come. The ruins here provide the temptation of immense potential for those who seek power, although every favor comes with a price. It was here that Strahd made an evil contract with the Dark Powers, became a vampire, and thus determined his own destiny. The temple now reeks of evil. The dark vestiges imprisoned within the temple will try to corrupt anyone who comes into contact with them, offering secrets and gifts in exchange for a taste of the evil that lurks within their true hearts. The temple itself is multileveled, there is a secret basement that not many knew about and there is also an observatory to track the stars and observe the skies, some floors above the main halls. Long forgotten and unmaintained, who knows what can be observed through the mists and clouds that cover the skies of Barovia. The observatory can be used to reach the highest peak of the Ghakis mountains, where a giant Roc protects its nest."

Faint whispering moans and muted screams echo beneath the feet of anyone who is crazy enough to visit this place. A massive oaken door appears to be the only entrance to the asylum and any who knock on it will surely be greeted by Lady Arieth, the asylum's attendant. A delicate young woman dressed only in a white shift, with scars of manacles on her slender wrists and ankles. Lady Arieth once believed herself to come from a different world but now works with other such deluded souls in an attempt to save their minds. With treatments only thought of by her devious mind, she tries to restore the sanity of not only the poor trapped in the asylum souls but also her own. The asylum has two important areas, the first one is known as the \"Cage of Tormented Souls\" where children lost in their misery scream and rock while hugging themselves, the elderly claw with nails wild and sharp at their own flesh or run near-naked as the white-clad attendants move about like specters, attempting to keep them from harming themselves. The worst sight of all are the quietest, those with eyes glazed, mouths open screaming terrible but silent cries, with scenes playing over and over again in their minds. The second area is called the \"Hallway of Delusions\". A generally much less violent area of the asylum where the air is filled with notes of sadness, mixed with frustration and anger. This is the place where an old friend and former companion of Lady Arieth is trapped. The large man known as \"Sol\" is dressed in little more than loose leggings. His chest and arms, heavily muscled and scarred. Against the back wall, the symbol of the sun is drawn in his own blood. He claims that he is a paladin of a sun god and begs to be freed and have his armor and weapons returned to him. Who really can say who is delusional and who is sane in this asylum?"

Most of its residents drowned, yet to this day, their souls still inhabit their bloated undead bodies and forcefully grab and drown those stupid enough to enter the swamp.

Black clouds of flies dart around, hungry for blood. Pockets of hallucination-inducing spores float about, with people claiming to see huge ships battling on the shallow waters, or trees moving to drier land, digging and placing their roots there, having fallen victim to them. When Strahd was done with the flooding, he used his magic to eternally bound Laszlo's spirit to the ruins of his own mansion. Other notable ruins are the Saint Andral's church that barely stands and its watery cemetery filled with undead. After Strahd flooded the village, he erected a monument to remind him of Marina. A few hundred meters from the monument, the standing stones of Berez... stand. More ancient than the Amber Temple, nobody remembers who built them.

It towers sinisterly above the land of Barovia, stark against the sky as an ever-present reminder of Strahd's dominance over the region. A long time ago, when King Barov was younger than Sergei, this land was owned by his family. The Tergs, a barbarian tribe that used horses and bows to fight, drove the von Zarovich family away from their rightfully owned lands. The castle was a small keep at that time and it was sieged, torched and raised by the Tergs who then used the ruins as their headquarters. Years later, Strahd came back with an army and massacred the Tergs and others that opposed him such as the Order of the Silver Dragon. Strahd rebuilt the small keep into a great magnificent castle, naming it Ravenloft to honour his mother, in an attempt to gain the appreciation of his cold-hearted father. This was the place where Strahd murdered his brother Sergei, where Tatyana Federovna leapt to her \"death\" and where Strahd's pact with Death was enacted. Later Strahd, as a vampire and darklord of Barovia, used the castle's premises to conduct experiments with Azalin's help. In the catacombs of the castle, he buried his parents and other important figures or actors of renown. The castle is now inhabited by many allies of Strahd such as his vampire brides, Rahadin, Gravestorm the Lich-Dragon and Khyristrix, a devil who has made a fiendish garden which feeds the Heart of Sorrow, a crystalline red shard found at the highest tower of the castle, with energies that protect Strahd. The garden is currently composed of 60 devil trees, which are created from humanoids that have killed while serving as hosts for garden larva. Garden larvae are immature devil trees, requiring humanoid hosts to fully mature. The trees, in turn, bear garden larvae as \"fruit\".

												"The river Ivlis extends broad and dominates the land in the lowest point of the Barovian valley. The Ivlis River runs through central Nova Vaasa, defining the Dom-mark's southern boundary, skirting Bergovitsa to the north, turning west into Barovia, cutting through the Old Svalich Woods, climbing the Balinoks in a valley eventually shared with the Old Svalich Road, skirting the Village of Barovia to the north, mounting spectacularly the Tser Falls, climbing the Svalich Path. The Ulvand River, which flows from the Howling Hills and Mount Sawtooth, and the Volgis River, which flows from the Vaesen Foothills, are both tributaries of the Ivlis. The Volgis joins the Ivlis from the north, immediately north of the Old Svalich Road, very near to the Barovian border. Ulvand, a bit south-east of Bergovitsa, eventually joins it from the south via the Vaere Bange Road. The Storrokke Canyon, midway between Arbora and Egertus, flows into the Nocturnal Sea. Given its swiftness, rapids, stones, and gravel bars, the upper portions of the Ivlis in Barovia are hard to travail even on a tiny raft. Its mouth, a maw of jagged stone teeth, opens into the sea. In between, the Ivlis' twists and narrowness make sailing too unpredictable and dangerous to be cost-effective, though that isn't to say it can't be done. Given that the Ivlis is both economically and physically impassable, a bridge has most likely been erected across it at a very narrow point. Up to the beginning of the Storrokke Canyon, one or more more bridges might be built. In most areas, the Ivlis is probably too deep to cross. However, there will be spots before the Storrokke Canyon where a horse could swim over. Crops, humans, domestic animals, and creatures all rely on the Ivlis for water. Without it, many of the animals who live in southern Dommark would perish. However, what begins as a strong band of farmland reaching back from the river's banks near the Barovian boundary becomes a fractured band.",

Because, as the river dips farther into the Storrokke Canyon, access to its waters in sufficient amounts becomes increasingly difficult, if not impossible. Ruins of abandoned farmsteads become widespread, especially on the north bank, where having the Dommark at one's back adds to the weight of life. The Rivtoffs levy harsh taxes on the farms.

												"The Keep of Forgetting sits atop the Dreadpass, guarding it against trespassers.  The story of the Keep of Forgetting precedes Strahd's ascension to the throne by several years, as the actions of his father Barov von Zarovich laid the foundations of the Keep. During the wars to reconquer Barovia from the Neureni Horde, one of the nobles who, supposedly following the von Zaroviches, turned on them in one of the pivotal battles with the Neureni, having sold their fellows out. They believed that the Neureni Horde would emerge victorious, but they had not counted on the tactical abilities of the von Zarovich family, who carried the day. The nobles retreated to their Keep, and Barov's soldiers followed. Standing at the keep, Barov proclaimed that the noble's family name would be stricken from all records and that the lives of any that did not surrender immediately would be forfeit. The nobles did not surrender, and Barov set in place a large force to besiege them. They were given strict orders to not engage, and rather to starve the family. Any that tried to escape or surrender were to be killed. After a year, everyone inside was dead, and the keep was abandoned. When Strahd made his pact with the fiend Inajira for his Dark Powers, the land changed. For the Keep, it came back to life. Skeletal soldiers walk the parapets now, patrolling incessantly, defending their keep against a foe that no longer exists. No one remembers their name, hence the nickname the Keep of Forgetting, but the undead here seem to be beyond Strahd's control, and will attack even him - though they stand no chance in such a combat, they do not submit to his will. Some brave or foolhardy locals who dared to explore have noticed that any skeletons destroyed will reform the very next day, and the keep never seems to run out. Some of these visitors have apparently been able to stay the night, resting under an old banner that once carried the family crest. Strahd ignores the Keep. It is a blind spot in his ability to control the land, as it was stricken from the records before he was born, and it doesn't appear in any of the books penned within Barovia. Strahd has seen it, but much to his frustration, as soon as it is no longer visible, he forgets about it. He knows he saw something, but he is unable to recall what it was..."

												"Between Mount Baratok and Mount Ghakis, stands Lake Zarovich, which is fed by streams of ice-cold water that pour down the face of Mount Baratok. On the south side of the lake rests the town of Vallaki and on the northern side of the lake, Aracos and Antonbucher are found. The lake's water is perfectly still and dark, reflecting the black clouds overhead like a great mirror. The center of the lake is covered with a dense cloud of mist. Fishermen avoid the misty part like it's the devil. Rumour has it that anyone who enters the mist will re-appear at a later time period, perhaps long years, aged as little as a few hours and totally forgotten by time. Others are moved to the past or even worse devoured by whatever horror hides in that area. Mirages of huge battleships, islands that never were, the lights of lighthouses that do not exist and other illusions or peeks into alternate realities occasionally appear through the mists. Unnatural phenomena such as whirlpools, maelstroms of different water coloration, or thunderstorms forming within the body of water occur. The Barovians usually fish right outside of their town's port avoiding any \"uncivilised\" parts of the lake. The lake, even though it is not as big as one would think, shelters a number of fish, unnaturally numerous for a lake of this size.",
												"The lake's shores are home to the Green Hag named Jenny Greenteeth. Barovians are terrified of her, but will occasionally, if in dire need, decide to meet her and ask for a service. Jenny will happily agree to deliver, as long as her price is met. She is only paid in the currency of life-span and years.",
												"The recent sightings of the Mad Wizard, who shoots bolts of electricity into the lake to take in huge catches of fish, have deterred the villagers from seeking Jenny. The villager's fear of meeting the wizard is greater than that of meeting Jenny, and eventually may convince them that the problem they want solved is smaller than a bolt of lightning or the risk of being devoured by the green hag. Although the Mad Wizard is thought of as a delirious fisherman, in his madness he does not use his spells to fish. Rather, the Mad Wizard is trying to target and suppress something way greater than a few tons of sturgeon. At the deepest part of the lake, a slumbering behemoth remains trapped since the formation of the domains of dread. The monstrosity is an undead aboleth cursed to be unable to travel the planes forever, its nature changed by years of absorbing necrotic energies. Fearful of Strahd, it remains dormant, only influencing the to-be warlocks or other poor creatures that it sees as worthy to use and further its schemes. There are an increasing number of cultists that worship the creature in the deep, mostly found at Antonbucher and Aracos. Strahd has yet to realise the existence of the Aboleth and quickly dismisses any information that reaches him about the cult that worships it, thinking the cultists to be madmen grasping at an explanation for the peculiar nature of the lake."

												"The Lysaga Hill is a hill in Barovia which can be found some 10 minutes walk away from the Tser Pool. The hill parts the forest which surrounds it, revealing a spur of bare rock jutting up from the earth. At the top of the hill, a blackened ruined tower of crumbling stone stands. The ancient ruins hide within them the Mountain Fane, the oldest of the three that Strahd utilised to be connected to the land. Long before the advent of Strahd, the location had profane importance, as a wicked cult conducted horrible sacrifices on moonless nights. When Saint Ecaterina established her monastery on the hill, she felt she had hallowed it, and the inhabitants of Barovia regarded Lysaga Hill as a sacred spot for a time after the tower was destroyed and the saint perished. The respect of the people dwindled as more pilgrims met their terrible ends on the peak. The hill now accommodates meetings of Barovian witches, hags and spirits. The witches of Lysaga Hill are men and women from the village and nearby farmsteads. They have limited magical skills as a result of their indoctrination into the religion of the demon Chernovog, which is led by Baba Zelenna, the green hag who is a vassal of Baba Lysaga. With each new moon, they meet at the hill, but Baba Zelenna herself is never far from the Mountain Fane. Unbeknown to Baba Lysaga, Baba Zelenna has great ambitions of her own for the future. She intends to summon Chernovog himself and urge him to murder Strahd (along with the other two hags accompanying her and Lysaga too) so that she can govern the valley without opposition. The Lysaga Hill is haunted by a creature which was formed by the remnants of souls of those that were sacrificed to the witches and hags. These souls formed the \"Caller in Darkness\", a creature that remains silent and hidden as long as the witches remain on the hill. When the witches are driven away, the caller manifests and tries to kill any living or undead creature on the hill. A tiny remnant of Saint's Ecaterina's power remains in the grounds of the tower, as a 30ft holy circle, though it no longer discerns between holy and unholy. Spirits and undead cannot enter the circle and all attacks coming from within the circle are considered as magical and gain a magical bonus of +2. The same circle will be used by Baba Zelena to summon, trap and control Chernovog. Amongst the rubble, a hidden trap door leads to the tower's basement. There, a tiny reliquary box, the size of a spellbook, lies buried beneath the runestone, beneath the rubble. Images of devas, planetars, and solars are etched into the sides and lid, but every angel's eyes are crimson with a sticky substance that looks disturbingly like blood. A folded piece of paper within the box contains the powdered bones of Saint Ecaterina, an item now devoid of all sacred power but protected by two Babau Demons."

Had it not been for the intervention of the monks, Leo would have almost defeated Strahd. Today it stands abandoned, despite rumors that before its dissolution it was packed with unimaginable treasures. It is still guarded by foul undead horrors that inhabit the bodies of the slain monks. Inside the monastery, there is a central but hidden chamber. This chamber is filled with silver threads that hide a terrifying secret and wooden broadloom machinery that the monks used to divine the future. The monks worshipped Mother Night who, some say, is responsible for the thread of fate. Some of the monks are said to still be alive, unharmed by the horrors of the monastery. One might seek them to gain secrets regarding their life. It is said that the monks can see the thread of life (or even cut) and always know the amount of time left to someone with but a single glance. The monks might also see the red thread of marriage. This is commonly thought of as an unperceived red cord around the finger of those that are destined to meet one another in \"true love\". The two people connected by the red thread are destined and star crossed lovers, regardless of the place, time, or circumstance. This magical cord may stretch and tangle, but never break. Finally, the monks may help one travel to the astral plane through astral projection. There is a catch though, anyone who astral travels with the monk's help, risks being stranded in the astral plane forever, their body possessed by the soul of a deceased monk of the monastery who stole their silver thread. All of the silver threads in the central room are threads stolen from victims who looked for an easy way to \"ascend\". The silver thread is described as a strong, silver-colored, elastic cord which joins a person's physical body to its astral body and once stolen, the departed soul cannot return to its body without guidance."

												"Mount Baratok is the most noteworthy top in the Balinoks, with a height of 7,440 ft. It is situated in the northern wilderness of Barovia, already sitting above Markovia, presently gazing into the Shadow Rift. The Old Svalich Road skirts its south-western flank. The late spring melt waters from its flanks feed Lake Zarovich, which is a wellspring of the Musarde River. On its lower level, the town of Aracos and village of Antonbucher sit. Mt. Baratok also hides the ruins of the Boszórkan Keep. The uninhabited little keep appears chaotic and disorganized, yet the walls are mostly in functioning order. Aside from a few cracks and holes here and there, the walls are mainly 13-15 feet tall. Terrorvine, a deadly plant endemic to Barovia, has taken over the courtyard. Any book stolen from the keep's library is magically set aflame and reappears in the library one week later at a random place, as the Dark Powers do not approve of their removal. On the east side of the mountain, a small camp of darklings, expelled from Vistani tribes for vile deeds beyond measure, can be found, magically bound to guard a cave. The dank and damp cave has a strongly acidic pool and varied oozes live inside it. These pools of acid dissolve any organic material that falls inside them in mere minutes. At the end of the cave, an acidic apple tree waits for those brave enough to wander and find it. These apples are the main ingredient for an acidic apple cider that is rumored to have positive enervating effects on those who drink it. The wood of the tree can be used to enchant any weapon by replacing its wooden handle, making it permanently drip acid and deal 1d6 acid damage with each blow. The darkling Vistani are magically forced by a spell similar to geas, to stop any oozes or their master, a semi-sentient hybrid of green ooze and cloud giant from escaping this cave. Unfortunately for them, they cannot harm it, but can only subdue it by making offerings of animal and metallic items for the giant to devour. If the giant is slain, the darklings will be free to leave and exact revenge on their tribes and other innocent people."

												"The Demiplane of Dread and the Core began with the realm of Barovia, which sprang from the horrific crimes of Strahd von Zarovich in 351 BC. Strahd has continued to govern the country and the bleak Barovian people via a phony succession of kings who all wear his name. The Village of Barovia \"takes pride\" in being imprisoned under Strahd's Choking Fog and the gaze of Castle Ravenloft. Barovia has had plenty of burgomasters but the latest one was Kolyan Indrirovich who resided in the Indrinovich Manor. Barovia's population always changes according to Strahd's mood but it usually numbers a few thousand residents between 1000 and 4500 people. The Blood o' the Vine Inn is the village's primary inn, where one may obtain a drink or a glass of wine. Underneath it, there is an old basement that used to be the \"nest\" of the Keepers of the Feather guild, but since the members moved to Vallaki to avoid Strahd's gaze, it remains unused. Another inn which is not as well regarded by the locals as the first one, is the Wolf's Den, owned and run by Daria Fidatov. It is a gathering spot for Vistani women who dance to attract tired travelers, hunters of the nearby woods and Barovian thugs and bandits. Bildrath, a greedy merchant, runs a general store called Bildrath's Mercantile. Barovia also has a temple which was once dedicated to Andral but was renamed to Sanctuary of Blessed Succor by Martyn \"the Mad\" Pelkar and Sasha Petrovich, founders of the Morninglord cult. Now it is just a ghost of its former self as it is almost ruined. Father Donavich resides here with his son, Doru, trapped in its basement. Barovia also has a haunted building which attracts innocent travelers. The Death House is a haunted mansion that was previously home to a cult that worshiped Strahd as a dark messianic figure. Strahd slaughtered them all when they kidnapped, murdered, and sacrificed innocent victims. The ghosts of the cultists and some of their families are still present. The House has little sentience or knowledge of its surroundings and occupants; it may generate illusions of children to entice unsuspecting victims. The house may reconstruct and repair itself if it is destroyed or damaged. Finally, northwest of the village, two areas of old remain. One is called the Dark Grove which is a desecrated druid's grove at the border crossings with Nova Vaasa and Hazlan in Barovia. It is a training place for priests seeking to join the Order of the Ebon Gargoyle but is also an accursed place where brave or perhaps paranoid Barovians visit to ask the spirits for the \"resurrection\" of their departed ones. Even though the resurrection seems to occur, the one that is raised is not the one that departed. Their nature is changed to that of undeath and the love they might once have had is replaced with bloodlust which they will chase with devious plans until all the people they once cared for take their place in the grove and are perhaps raised as well to accompany them. The other location is a training facility for recruits who wish to join the Order of the Ebon Gargoyle as soldiers and fighters. The trainee must live inside the Great Oubliette, a labyrinth where the mental and physical capabilities of the ones who enter are tested."

Immol has a population of 2080-5400 and is home to a tiny refugee Thaani and Forfarian community.

The Ildi'Thaan seek to recover the Thirteen Texts of Thaan, a collection of tomes that, when united, are said to grant the Thaani knowledge and power. They are said to have been founded by the sole person to venture out of Bluetspur with their mind intact a century after the thirteen original survivors of the Thaan escaped into Immol. (This includes the ability to defeat Bluestpur's mind flayers.) The members aim to tap into the power of the mind via strict discipline and unwavering effort. They are opposed to magic (hence no wizards) and mystical tricks (thus no true psionicists). The Bolting Stag stands out as Immol's lone inn, a living museum of Forfarian traditions and social behaviors, a strong whiskey, and superb lamb sausage.

Krezk's centre is protected by strong physical fortifications, from which four quarters extend: one for general commerce, one for upmarket trade where the Red Vardo Traders are based; a trade en-terprise. They are well-known for recovering misplaced items and are directed by Jacqueline Montarri, one for housing, and one for institutions of religion. The ancient Terg siege left behind some old structures. Because of the existence of the Cult of the Morninglord and the Sanctuary of First Light (now known as the Abbey of Saint Markovia), the Cult's most important shrine, many Gundarakite residents have relocated to Krezk from the south. The locals of Krezk mostly operate as a commune and even though they trade with merchants, they are almost hostile to anyone else that is not a part of their commune or someone who can offer a service or trade with them. Krezkites grow trees and vegetables, cut wood to heat their homes, raise chickens and pigs, and share their food. A few of them have cows and mules, but there are no horses in Krezk. The town has no need for an inn as no outsider is allowed to stay in Krezk unless they have a permit from burgomaster Dmitri Krezkov. If they do have a permit, they can dwell in any of the town's cottages in exchange for services requested by the owner. Residents never leave the village for fear of being at tacked by wolves, dire wolves, and werewolves which infest the nearby areas. Krezk has its own militia which is mainly used to patrol the stone walls and to make sure that any visitors don't remain for a longer period than needed. A blessed pool at the north end of the village provides fresh water throughout the year. Next to the pool, the locals built a shrine to the Morninglord, covering it with a gazebo. It's known as the Shrine of the White Sun.The Abbey of Saint Markovia is no longer a holy place. Screams can be heard from it and it is no longer being visited by Gundarakites, who now prefer to visit the pool. There is a prophecy that somewhere in the catacombs of the abbey, the headquarters of the Dawnslayers still remains and when the time is right, the Dawnslayers will rise again to fight evil. The Needle of Ghaddar is a towering minaret that towers over Krezk's center plaza. It is unknown why the von Zarovich Family has allowed its existence since the Terg takeover.

Following the First Unwise Rebellion, the Gundars built the fastness to keep a watch on the region's nobility and secure the profitable commerce along the Crimson Road. Count von Zarovich's most difficult and brutal hamlet to conquer in the aftermath of the Great Upheaval, Zeidenburg, required a four-month siege that ended only when the Gundarakites were overpowered not by Barovian warriors, but by rats multiplying in the village's mass graves. The most famous Gundarakite rebel group is known as the \"Courses of Chaos\". Their leader, Ardonk Szerieza (Fighter 4/ Rogue 4), uses imported smoke powder to mount terrorist attacks against the government of the city. Zeidenburg is the place where Lyssa von Zarovich, Strahd's niece, resides. She is a powerful vampire with strength that belies her age. As part of a massively insane plot, she helped, presumably as a necrologist, in the genesis of the illithid vampire and, as a result, most likely has at least a passing knowledge with the concepts of biomancy. Lyssa conspires with Bluetspurean illithids to create a vampiric version of their race. She hopes to use these vampire mind flayers to take over Barovia.",
												"Antonbucher is a small port village across the lake from Vallaki with a small populace of 90 to 300 people. Most of the village is centered around the fishing fleet, which provides the major food source for Vallaki. Antonbucher is also a supply and trade center for the mining and logging camps around Mt. Bartok. Somehow the fishermen of Antonbucher are resistant to the peculiar nature of the lake and can travel its waters but not always. One hundred years ago, Antonbucher was dying. Not a proper village yet, just a few rickety shacks around the docks. Plague and drought ravaged the land, the catch was scanty, the boats rotted in port, the town's people boiled nettles and fish heads for soup and still went to bed hungry. Robb Drake, a wealthy noble from Vallaki offered Antonbucher salvation. It has a population of 90 to 300 people and its most notable areas are the Docks, Byronite's general store, Black Sails tavern, the old church of St. Johan and the old watchtower that used to look out for danger and warn the fishermen."

Their life-span is shorter than that of others found in Barovia due to the working conditions of the mines.

Hoessla has a large clock tower which signals, via a bell, the time for the men to go to and return from the mines. Its clock is damaged and does not work as many of its gears are missing.

Jarnivak is not an important place and other than the small cottages, pig farms and a small temple of a long forgotten god, nothing else of interest can be found. Except one thing, the residents themselves. These people are all immortal and forgotten by time; they have lived since Strahd was still the human conqueror who freed them from the Tergs. The people of Jarvinak do not recognise their longevity as time does not register in their minds. The reason for their immortality is their enchanted blood. Strahd used the people in an experiment to create a herd that would be able to feed him eternally with blood that not only would sustain him but also empower him. He hid the village with the powers granted to him by the land to impede any other vampire from feeding from his personal \"blood cellar\". Strahd has failed to give empowering traits to the blood of the people but he surely made them immune to ageing. Angered by his failure, he moved on to other more promising experiments and permanently hid the village behind a veil of mist."

The other winery is owned by the Badunas family, which, being irritated and dissatisfied with their social status, try to outcompete Milos. Nikolai Badunas (Rogue 3), a merchant by progression, is the youngest member of the family. He is a known cheat and troublemaker. He secretly sabotages the Winery of the burgomaster to make him appear as an untrustworthy winemaker.

Nobody really likes him but since he is a merchant, most of the people will quickly forget the harsh prank they fall victim to.

It occasionally struggles with the winter cold and as their land freezes, so do the crops, resulting in hunger.

The village has an inn called the \"Seven Tables Inn\" where one can hear or share any rumor as rumormongers are welcome there. A visitor can trade their wares mainly at the Hare and Hair, a general store operated by Gregori Wurlbach. His establishment is both a shop that sells adventuring gear (but not weapons or armor) and an inn where three rooms can be rented by travelers. The other area is known as the \"Eyes of Midnight\" and it is owned and operated by Fillar Esven. He mainly trades oddities, jewelry, and other weird or unusual items.

Finally, if one takes a path from Orașnou into the Svalich Woods, they would quickly reach the Fidatov Manor. Once home to Lady Marilena Fidatov, the Manor and all its inhabitants became cursed after she was poisoned by Burgomaster Ivan Randovich. Lady Fidatov pleaded with the Dark Powers to make certain that no one else profited from the Manor or its wealth. In retribution, the Dark Powers issued a horrible curse that forced an eternal cycle of normalcy during the day and horror throughout the night. The residents of the manor would repeat the day before the curse occurred throughout the day, but at night they would turn into horrifying undead or wererats.

His pale complexion detracts from his image of strength, but eating restores color to it and gives him a healthier aspect. His ears, which are pointed like those of an elf, his most peculiar aspect. He occasionally conceals this by combing his black hair over the tips, but he can easily explain them away by falsely claiming to be descended from elves, so he normally does not bother hiding them unless he is attempting not to be identified. His long, pointed nails are also unique, and he frequently conceals them with gloves. Strahd's fangs, unlike those of other vampires, are easily concealable, retracting when he no longer requires them. Strahd wears the finery of a Barovian nobleman, favoring black with red and white accents. He favors long cloaks and a gold necklace with a huge red stone around his neck.",
										"Strahd was doomed to be the devil long before his human birth. Count Strahd von Zarovich was a decent man with a talent for alchemy. Harrowed by his darker impulses, he employed the Apparatus, an experimental magical-alchemic contraption, to separate his evil and toxic half from himself and hurl it away. Unbeknownst to the Alchemist, this wicked side was reborn elsewhere in the multiverse as Strahd von Zarovich, who went on a crusade to take back the lands of his ancestors and eventually doomed himself to vampire-dom. Before Strahd's birth, Baba Lysaga had made a pact with Mother Night to dedicate a baby, born of noble lineage to her. In exchange Lysaga would have power and enjoy immortality. When Strahd was born, she recognized the baby Strahd's potential for evil and realised that it was the baby destined for her goddess. Lysaga approached the Zarovich family and wormed her way into their home in the guise of a midwife for Queen Ravenovia van Roeyen, Strahd's mother. Lysaga ensured that Strahd would be able to cast spells and follow an evil path by using the baby as a conduit for bloody rituals cast over empty graves under the full moon. When Ravenovia realised what Lysaga's actions were doing, she cast her away to protect Strahd. His destiny was already determined as he had a dark soul of and a chain of villainy tied to his life's web. Although Lysaga was dismissed, she kept close to Strahd to ensure that her \"son\" grew up as intended. Strahd's father was cruel and mostly absent, only caring for his crusades and political schemes. Barov only cared that Strahd would be trained as his successor in warfare and politics. He never considered him as his son but as a tool to further his schemes. Strahd had a difficult childhood, always trying to prove himself worthy of his father's attention. Eventually Strahd determined himself on the path to reclaim his ancestral lands from the Tergs. While still mortal, he made a pact with the arcanaloth Inajira, bargaining for military success in return for eternal servitude, and receiving a valuable artifact from Inajira as collateral, further sealing his fate. Strahd was renowned as a heroic general with ideals similar to that of a paladin, but that would later change. When he rebuilt Castle Ravenloft atop the old keep's ruins, he invited his family to join him. Barov would show no appreciation for his son's achievements, and Lysaga lethally poisoned Ravenovia as she made her way to the castle. Strahd had managed to achieve his dream but none recognised it, making him feel hollow. Sergei, his younger brother, was the only one family member to come to the castle. Strahd saw in Sergei everything that he could be but wasn't. He had spent most of his life chasing empty wishes. Sergei eventually fell in love with a village maiden named Tatyana, Strahd became obsessed with her. In her young life and passion, he saw what his brother had, what he wanted to steal from Sergei, what he had never had: youth and purity... Strahd tried to approach Tatyana to express his desires, but she saw him only as an elder brother to her true love, Sergei.",
										"In his depression, a whispered evil approached. A creature that Strahd knew was \"Death\". Death gave him knowledge of an ancient temple made of amber, hidden at the tallest peak of the Balinok Mountains. There, Strahd found an entity, Vampyr. The trapped vestige offered him immortality in exchange for a sacrifice. Strahd was fated to kill the person he loved the most and in turn be killed by those that hated him with passion. On Tatyana and Sergei's wedding day, Strahd murdered his brother with a Baal Verzi dagger, a relic from a society of dark assassins. In her despair, Tatyana threw herself from the castle walls. Strahd's enemies made their move, bolts and an arrow piercing his. body. Yet, he would not die but rather would be \"reborn\" in undeath. He became the first vampire and welcomed the mists, thus creating Ravenloft. Strahd's curse is that though he is absolute lord and master of Barovia, to the point where he can enter any home as the land's rightful owner, once in every generation he will meet a woman whom he believes is Tatyana reincarnated. As he tries to claim her, she always dies, spurned his advances in horror. Tatyana's latest reincarnations always evade his grasp. Strahd has had to deal with at least two darklords in the past: Azalin Rex the lich and Lord Soth the death knight.

It is unknown if Ravenloft would exist in its current form without Strahd's evil, although his evil appears to have had a considerable role in it. Strahd has grown in evil and might during the period of the tale recorded in The Tome of Strahd, becoming a necromancer of immense power and learning much about the prison that binds him. He has interacted with most of the Core's great characters, establishing alliances and enmities that have shaped the face of Ravenloft to this day. His partnership with Madame Eva, where he offered the Vistani free passage in exchange for them becoming his informants, is particularly noteworthy. Strahd despises the lich Azalin, who was once his reluctant servant, but is now his greatest nemesis. Their antagonism reached a climax at the Grand Conjunction, when Azalin came dangerously near to annihilating Strahd, but Strahd survived that encounter as he has every other. When Lord Soth arrived in Castle Ravenloft, Strahd understood that Soth's strength was actually a match for him. Armies of Strahd's slaves were defeated by Lord Soth, and the devastation and destruction inflicted by Soth compelled even Strahd to reconsider. Strahd had to give Lord Soth what he had sought, the disloyal retainer Caradoc, in order to remove Lord Soth from Barovia, for fear of the death knight wrecking further damage to his kingdom."

Strahd is unaffected by garlic, mirrors, or holy symbols. He is free to enter any building in Barovia, whether he is invited or not.

The only possible way to stop Strahd from existing is to kill the vampire and, before he is brought back to life, slay the alchemist of Mordent. An evil act that would most likely result in the birth of a new darklord. There is also another way; if somehow the Alchemist is convinced to visit his dark counterpart and merge with his evil self via the Apparatus, the vampire Strahd would cease to exist. Such a thing would be almost impossible to happen though, since neither the Alchemist nor Strahd would ever agree to this."

Rumor has it that those who have had the immense luck of encountering him describe a feeling of absence and complete serenity, as though there was no order, no chaos, just an absolute. In reality, those who met that entity felt the void engulf them as all of their memories and secrets were drawn from them into the void of his hood. Things grow even more complicated as ancient texts discuss the powers of this entity.",
										"According to legend, the power of the Severance was \"absolute\". With such a description, it is not surprising that many authorized the banning of all books mentioning the Severance. After all, the Severance is foremost a god of secrets and knowledge. Therefore, he came to be known as \"the Anonymous One\", \"The Nameless One\", \"The One Who Should Not Be Named\", \"The Whispered One\", \"The Great Keeper\".",
										"Since the Severance is the \"gap\" between the light and the dark, he is neither living nor dead, nor is he quite physical, simply absolute. Such a power can make both celestial beings and devils tremble. The holy symbol of this entity is a book with an eye drawn on and chained shut so that it can never be opened. The favorite weapon of those that follow him is the dagger. The Severance's domain is mainly found in neutral, knowledge, secrets, madness and magic. The worshippers of the Severance are known as \"The Keepers of Forbidden Lore\" and usually consist of wizards, clerics, warlocks, rogues and even bards. The Keepers believe that there is knowledge too evil for the world to know.",
										"They hunt down secrets and information they deem to be too dangerous for the world at large and keep it secret in the name of the Severance. The only known temple in Ravenloft that was made to worship this entity was the Amber Temple found in Barovia. Not every worshipper uses the same method to worship the Severance and usually, each method is kept a secret. One of the most commonly used methods of worship is a unique prayer. The worshipper whispers their secrets into an effigy of a closed palm of a severed arm, usually made out of branches, cloth and animal bones and thus, the prayer is complete. The uninitiated usually confuse this effigy for a voodoo doll or a spell component of evil magic.",
										"It is generally considered a great sin for a Keeper to have their effigy found by others. The main motto of the Keepers is \"Learn, Lie, keep secrets, promote confusion, sow distrust.\"",

								"Borca is a land of corruption, revenge, and intrigue, a land where a vial of poison is just as likely (if not more so) than a polite conversation to resolve an issue. But while Borca was always like this, not long ago, it was actually more peaceful (though still just as deadly), but that was before the Grand Conjunction.",
								"During the Grand Conjunction, the borders between Borca and Dorvinia blurred and Ivana and Ivan sought comfort in each other's arms, as they had long been penpals. However, when the cataclysmic event ended, the two domains merged, and the pair found that everything that tied them together as penpals pulled them apart when they were together. Now, they cannot stand each other, and the Dark Powers have divided the domain between them. Ivana ultimately holds the power of the throne, but Ivan holds the reins of the tax collectors and the money of the domain. And with that, an internal and eternal war has been created as each tries in vain to poison the other.",
								"As they are related, both ultimately hail from Dilisniya stock, and the family even has remote ties with the Von Zaroviches of Barovia. One of their ancestors was present at Strahd I's wedding, though they somehow survived that event. Evil tongues say that Leo Dilisniya was partly to blame for what happened and that Strahd exacted a terrible revenge upon him. Regardless, the family line survived and spread throughout the Core, eventually culminating in Ivan and Ivana (though many more Dilisniyas live in many of the domains of the Core, no others have risen to such a level of prominence). Just as the favored weapon of both darklords is poison, so does poison run through the veins of the Borcan populace, in a very literal sense. Any liquid in Borca can, at the command of Ivan or Ivana, be turned into poison when it passes the domain's borders. Often, their foes think that they have escaped, only to fall foul of poison hours or days after they thought themselves safe. But that may not be the most dangerous part of Borca - that may well be the Borcans themselves. They are as likely to scheme and plot as the worst nobles of Richemulot or Dementlieu, but while there they may consider the smearing of another's name enough to win a clandestine war, the Borcans will never let it lie.",
								"Poison and other means of dealing death without evidence are popular here, but none more so than the duels. The law in Borca is so corrupt (not helped by being under the control of Ivan), that sentences are carried out based on cost - the life of a commoner will cost the culprit 73 gold pieces, whereas the life of a noble might cost thousands. As such, most turn to duels as a way to get personal satisfaction and revenge. This is the only way that a commoner might find some measure of satisfaction against a noble, but everyone is entitled to the use of \"seconds\", assistants or mercenaries that take the place of the duelist. Professional duelers are paid a great deal of money for these tasks, as they often prove deadly. Adventures in Borca should focus on the struggles between Ivan and Ivana as each makes their way through Borcan society in a futile attempt to poison the other.",
								"The intrigue lies heavy here, and adventurers are likely to get drawn into plots that are beyond their control. This ranges from the simple matter of escorting one of Ivana's favored noblewomen (possibly one of the ermordenung) or one of Ivan's tax collectors, to protect them from attack to encountering one of the darklords directly and being instructed to deal with the other darklord. This could even be simpler and involve the heroes being dragged into one of the many vendettas among the Borcan nobility, perhaps with one of the heroes hired to be a second for one of the nobles. Upon killing the other duelist, the heroes find themselves the target of assassins looking for \"justice\" for the murdered noble.",

Deer are common here, as are hares, and other smaller animals. The exception here comes in two forms: the bats of Mt. Gries (covered below), and monstrous insects. There are swarms of insects in the hills and forests of Borca, and many of them venomous.

										"Borca is a vibrant land, dominated by hardwood trees, which lumberjack fell in the west. But what strikes a visitor are the many plants of all kinds that can be found here, ranging from beautiful flowers to healthy fruits and berries. However, appearances can be deceiving. Many of these plants, no matter how innocent or normal they appear at first, are often poisonous - Borcans know that plants, where the flesh of the plant is purple, should be avoided at all costs. The same goes for any water that has a purplish tint, as it is likely to be a carrier of poison from some plant or other. While the purple tint is not a guarantee of something being poisonous (and the absence of the color is not a guarantee of it being non-poisonous), it is a very good indicator. Borca is also home to many toadstools, and they are universally poisonous unless prepared in the correct manner. This process is incredibly rigorous and difficult, and only a master chef would ever attempt it. A popular method of poisoning someone in Borca is simply to bribe one of these chefs to serve the meal wrong - in other domains, nobles might avoid such dishes, but in Borca it is considered proof of one's courage to eat one of these meals, and cowardice to decline. Of course, should someone be challenged by another, and then die of poisoning, it is considered bad form on behalf of the host, and they will inevitably be challenged to a duel. No one considers the chefs to be guilty of such a trick, as they are merely the tool used by a poisoner. There are two plants that stick out among the multitude of plants in Borca. The first is passionflesh. This plant resembles an eggplant but has deep purple and red striations in the skin and flesh. It is mildly toxic (though not lethal unless partaken of to extreme degrees), but it is somewhat addictive. It is an aphrodisiac that supposedly enhances the imbiber's pleasure tenfold. As such, many Borcans use the plant frequently and many are addicted, though they take care not to poison themselves (at least usually). The other plant is the caldura rose. It is a white, exquisitely delicate, rose with long thorns and pale pink blooms in the petals. To the Borcans, the flower is symbolic - a fresh caldura rose is the sign of marriage, while a cut one is a sign of adultery. The rose is not without its dangers either, as once cut, it supposedly drains the vitality of those nearby. However, when imbibed in certain teas and ointments, it reputedly helps drive out disease. While this is not definitely proven, Borcans believe this to be the case and use the flower freely as a result."

Most Borcans dismiss these as tall tales until confronted with proof that they exist. At that point, the room turns quiet, many pray to their gods, and the next day they seem to have forgotten about it again, moving on to whatever other challenges they face."

Almost everything grows well here, but not as abundantly as in neighboring Falkovnia. Care must also be taken by the farmers to ensure that their crops aren't poisonous when harvested. Summers tend to be pleasant, if slightly cool, and winters can become quite harsh, though the terrain prevents the worst of it. Borca has a number of geysers (often referred to as hellspouts by the Borcans) that can be found everywhere. Some are well-known and can be timed, while others are unpredictable. These geysers carry many minerals with them when they sprout, and some Borcans have built health spas near them. In other cities, they are used as a  way of punishment. Those that cannot pay the fines that the law requires are put to death, and in places where they have geysers, this means being boiled alive by the scalding water."

The estate sits north of Lechberg, and is surrounded by a thick wall. It is a place of untended gardens that are poisonous or black with rot. The sole exception to this is the kitchen and medicinal gardens. Beyond the black wrought-iron gates of Degravo, it is not possible to find beauty. In short, Degravo is a squat, ugly mansion, with squat ugly buildings surrounding it, far too square for any architect worth their salt and it resembles a mix of a prison more than a house. Inside, Degravo is a marvel of self-indulgent splendor. Ivan has his own private theatre, ballrooms, dining halls, chambers for displaying weapons, toys, and armor, and even opulent lounges thick with the smell of hallucinogens.  Central to all of this is Ivan's \"Laughing House\", the central hall where he usually meets his guests. Those asked to dine should be wary, as Ivan has no taste buds at all, and since he cannot be poisoned, he often serves meals that others would never partake in. He has hired several excellent cooks, which means that on a lucky night you'll get delectables the like of which you'll find nowhere else. But if you're unlucky, you end there on a day where rotten rat is being served alongside offal.

Levin is one of the highest-ranking priests of Ezra anywhere, and the leader of one of the sects. He is also utterly corrupt, taking bribes from both Ivan and Ivana, in return for stirring the populace up with his speeches to support whatever schemes they are cooking up, though he is careful to avoid engaging directly in anything that the other darklord could subsequently accuse him of. He is playing a dangerous game indeed, jumping between the two, but for the last few years, he has been doing so successfully and greatly enriched the church (and himself, his family, and his supporters) as a result. A new election for Praesidius is coming up, but everyone in the Levkarest clergy knows that this is just a ploy for Levin to root out his enemies within the priesthood - he has already bought the votes he needs from the high-ranking clergy."

It is a single building but with soaring minarets and walkways high above the city streets. These have been nicknamed the \"widow's walks\" and Ivana supposedly haunted them whenever one of her husbands died. Most of the people of Levkarest believe it's just a matter of time before some hapless sod falls into her clutches and dies again, which has given rise to the estate's nickname \"Miseria Corpa\" - the body of misery. Vaulted ceilings and polished marble floors dominate Misericordia, with heavy tapestries and soft carpets dominating the galleries where guests can sit in comfort in ornately carved furniture, most of it imported from outside of Borca - a subtle display of Ivana's wealth.  Misericordia is thick with secret passages, most of which are for the servants to move about unobtrusively, but rumor has it that Ivana has even more tunnels of her own, for moving around the estate and stalking her guests. Supposedly her private suite can only be accessed through a series of these tunnels. Those who enter Misericordia had best watch their step and behave appropriately.

His eyes are bright blue, and his thin lips are usually drawn up in a quirky grin. Ivan is 68, but has the vitality of a man half his age. A true fop, Ivan fancies himself a great actor and master of the arts. When he is not clad in the finest of Borcan and Dorvinian fashions, he dons theatrical costumes ranging from that of a court jester to a paladin. Ivan has a soft, tenor voice with a high, rapid laugh, but at a moment's notice, both can change. His voice can become a low, velvety whisper or a dramatic boom. He enjoys changing his voice often since he believes it illustrates his theatrical talents. Ivan will gesture dramatically and rapidly pace back and forth to punctuate his words, giving the impression that he's less a man and more an animated marionette.",

Five years later, both Camille and Ivan's mother bore children on the same night and dark moon.

In return she doted on her \"dearest little brother\", blind to the evil that welled inside of him. Tragically that all came crashing down. His love turned to bitter jealousy when she was married and then became inchoate rage when she bore a child. Hurt, Ivan poisoned his sister and her husband (the lucky child was stolen away by a midwife). Now at the age of 21, his family discovered his foul deeds and chased him from town. With nowhere to go, Ivan fled into the mists where the domain of Dorvinia was created for him.",

From the poisoning of Vlad Drakov's troops when they tried to attack his domain, to his intriguing letters to Ivana over the finer techniques of poisoning, and finally, his marriage to Lucretia who later became a victim of uxoricide after faking the deaths of their three children. What really changed things for Ivan was the Grand Conjunction when earthquakes and general chaos allowed him to leave his realm and head straight to Ivana. Given Ivana's more dominant personality, she renamed  the newly combined lands to Borca and took over the duties of state,while Ivan was given control over the new domain's police, military, and tax collection forces.

Three times a day, Ivan can turn a small non-magical object into poison dust via his touch. The poison must be ingested and he can create one of three types. The creature that ingests the poison must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. If the creature fails, the effect varies based on the type of poison Ivan created. The deadly variety that kills the victim, the dangerous one that inflicts poison damage, or the malingering one which leaves the victim weak and bedridden for {@dice 1d4} days. Ivan Dilisnya commands fanatical loyalty among his inner circle of servants, guards and spies, chiefly through his use of an insidious poison known as Borrowed Time. This venom courses permanently through the veins of Ivan's key minions. Ivan poisoned these souls with Borrowed Time years ago, laying a sentence of death that only he can stay.",

Ivan is fickle however, and even the appearance of disloyalty can provoke Ivan to withhold Mercy at the last moment. A dose of Borrowed Time must be ingested each day for seven consecutive days for it to begin taking effect; thus, it is somewhat impractical for Ivan to inflict the poison on anyone but his own servants."

												"Camille Dilisnya was born in Mordent in 662 BC. She was the heir to the vast and powerful Dilisnya family that de facto ruled large portions of Mordent.",
												"Camille was beautiful, with long, dark hair, full lips and a small waist. Between her beauty and her fortune, by the time she had reached fifteen, dozens of suitors wanted her hand. Her father chose Siegfried Grymig and in 681 BC the couple were married. Siegfried was not handsome, but was a Barovian boyar with an ancient family that dominated the wool trade in southern Barovia. He was wealthy beyond measure and the children of Siegfried and Camille would inherit vast political influence and wealth. Camille was happy enough for three years until she discovered her husband was indulging in one of the oldest of  boyar customs, he was having an affair. His lover was Maria Diazi, a servant girl that worked in the manor. Incensed beyond measure, Camille seduced the local alchemist and convinced him to give her the most painful poison he could make. What he gave her was a draught called the Wasting. The victim would be locked inside their own body, unable to move but their nerves would be on fire as the poison slowly dissolved their nervous system. Through the magic of the poison, the creature would remain conscious until death took them.",
												"Camille gleefully took the poison and tested it on the foolish but helpful alchemist. Satisfied with the results, Camille returned to her manor and prepared a special dinner. She insisted Maria join her and her husband at dinner. The young girl and Siegfried were definitely nervous, but Camille insisted. She had lived in the manor for three years and knew nothing of the servants that lived there. She was going to have dinner with one servant every week until she knew them all. As the first course was served, Siegfried and Maria ate in silence while Camille talked of her day.",
												"After a few bites the poison had taken effect. With Maria and Siegfried defenseless, Camille unceremoniously dumped them on the ground. She took a  poker from the fireplace and held it over Maria. She taunted the young woman while searing her flesh with the poker. By the time the poor servant girl died, her eyes, nose, and tongue had been burned to ashes. Camille blamed the murders on the alchemist. She concocted an elaborate story about the alchemist falling in love with her and trying to poison Siegfried and Camille while taking the poison himself. The poor servant girl had taken the poison by accident and fallen into the fire. The local authorities did not wish to dispute the word of Lady Dilisnya, and the murders became an open secret in Mordent. Siegfried's family was a completely different issue. They swore revenge for his death. After a few close calls the Dilisnya's sent Camille to live with distant relations in Invidia. As she crossed into the misty borders between domains, she was given Borca. Since becoming the darklord of Borca, Lady Dilisnya has been granted the ability to craft any poison she can imagine. The ingredients and preparation process forms in her mind as she thinks about the effect she wants the poison to have. She can even create supernatural poisons, although she has no arcane knowledge herself.",
												"The Lady Dilisnya was also cursed that any man she ever loved would betray her. She married three more times, and all of her husbands betrayed her for another woman or man. Despite being married four times Camille has only had one child, a daughter Ivana.",

She seduced Pieter and made sure they were discovered by Ivana.",

With a little prodding, Ivana poisoned him a week later. Ivana was furious with her mother, but Camille knew she had actually performed a favor for her daughter.

								"Daglan was named after its second darklord, Daglan Daegon, though it can be argued that he was in fact the first, and that Radaga was merely a caretaker - a vessel - for his ultimate return and rise to the status of darklord. Daglan as such was formed from their shared lust for power, a domain where ancient undead lurked, controlled by the two masters, one a priestess of the undead, the other a powerful necromancer, but both with powers well beyond those given to others of their kind. Though small (less than 50 miles across in any direction), Daglan had several thriving farming communities, though none of them ever exceeded 500 (with Homlock being both the largest and oldest), and the populace was fairly rustic, with some odd and unfortunate habits. The people themselves were reclusive and reserved. Their style of clothing reflected this, with everyone wearing loose-fitting robes that obscured the person's features. This was the perfect cover for Radaga's and Daglan's minions, as the undead that they both controlled, and sometimes even the goblyns that Radaga created, were able to move about without being noticed. These undead creatures rarely caused trouble as they were tasked to keep the peace and ensure that any troublemakers disappeared. Of course, with Daglan originally confined to the artifact known as the Crown of Souls - a prison that could contain even this powercrazed necromancer. It required something spectacular to free him, which happened when a group of brave heroes defeated Radaga. He took her body for his own and came back to life. Shortly thereafter, they put him to death permanently.  Adventures in Daglan should focus on the cost that comes with wanting power. Perhaps the heroes meet one of the goblyns that Radaga has transformed when the (formerly human) unfortunate soul rejected her advances. Perhaps they run into a group of the undead who are in the act of silencing troublemakers. Perhaps the heroes even are the troublemakers themselves. Or maybe they know the Crown of Souls from ancient myths from their own homeland, about a powerful wizard, who was betrayed by his king, and whose soul transcended into a mighty artifact that tried to control all who wore it.",

There was one exception, as out in the grasslands, several prides of lions roamed. The locals avoided them entirely, often abandoning fields to the predators, as they were far too dangerous to deal with. Occasionally, the lions would run into an undead pack, a bloodbath usually ensued. Normally the undead came out on top in those confrontations, but there was one pride where the alpha male seemed particularly strong and aggressive (and large, by all accounts, at least nine feet to the shoulder) and he destroyed all the undead packs.

While he worked Daglan used his magic to spy on the warlord and his inner counsel. What he heard made him rage. The warlord had decided Daglan had become too powerful and must be slain.",

												"Daglan soon understood why. His undead minions were needed for an upcoming campaign against the elves of the forest that bordered the warlord's new empire. As the campaign ended, Daglan saw the trap. He was isolated from his disciples during the final battle, surrounded by the warlord and his retinue of fanatical bodyguards. As the final elf fell, Daglan felt the spear point slam into his back. As he fell from his horse, his soul was transferred to one of the gems in the warlord's crown.",

The skirmish was brief but the Crown of Souls was lost, knocked from the warlord's head by a stray arrow and rolling into mists that had started to surround the battlefield. In the confusion the crown was found by one of the surviving elves as they fled the battlefield. The elf placed the crown upon his head and his soul was drawn into the crown. The elf's soul and Daglan have fought for supremacy inside the crown ever since. Daglan is stronger but the elf weakens Daglan to the point that he cannot possess anybody that wears the crown. Daglan can only possess dead bodies killed within 30 feet of the crown. As the years crept on, Daglan discovered that every time one of his descendants died, Daglan was able to feed on their soul and grow stronger. Eventually the crown was pulled into Ravenloft along with one of his last descendants, the father of Radaga."

												"Radaga was born in Kartakass, sometime after the domain was pulled into Ravenloft. As she grew up, she knew nothing about her parents; her mother died during childbirth and her father disappeared just a day after her birth. As an abandoned child, she was sent to a monastery, to be raised in the faith of the sisters there. The monastery was one of a handful that were dedicated to the Raven Queen on the Core. It sat over an extensive set of catacombs, and was one of the few areas in Ravenloft free from the scourge of the undead. Radaga grew into a beautiful, yet isolated woman. Male visitors to the monastery always fawned over her and she soon considered them little more than expendable tools that could be used and discarded. As time passed, Radaga became increasingly concerned that one day her looks would fade. Whenever she looked in a mirror, she could see a million small flaws reflected back at her. She never understood how others couldn't see them. Her sisters at the monastery always commented on her beauty, but Radaga knew they were lying. As time passed, she knew they were mocking her.",
												"She could see the flaws in her beauty, and her sisters clearly had to see them. There was no way they could miss them. One day, as she spoke the endless prayers of her order, Radaga had a vision. A woman lying on a stone slab, a dagger above her heart. The dagger was brought down. The woman on the stone slab screamed as she aged a century or more in seconds. The vision expanded. Radaga saw the back of the woman with the dagger. When she turned around Radaga saw herself. She was perfect. Absolutely flawless. Radaga became obsessed with the stone table and the dagger.",
												"She tried to remember every detail of the table, the dagger, the room, anything. It haunted her dreams and her waking hours. Radaga took to wandering aimlessly through the halls of her monastery, often finding herself deep in the catacombs. Deep, deep in the catacombs, she finally found the table, and it was there that her descent into madness truly began. Radaga began to lure her sisters into the catacombs, often under the pretense of praying in a small chapel she had discovered. Once in the catacombs, Radaga would disable her victims with her spells and sacrifice them to her vanity on the altar. Her perceived flaws vanished, although new ones always appeared. It was only a matter of time before she was discovered. Radaga fled the monastery mere minutes before her vengeful sisters gave chase. Radaga fled to the mists, and, with that, the domain of Daglan was born. As the domain formed around her, Radaga found a crown, inlaid with precious jewels and made of the purest gold. The crown called to her, but Radaga did not know why."

								"Forlorn truly is what its name says. Forlorn, and devoid of all hope. The crimes of Tristen were so numerous, and the ways in which he killed those who mattered to him were so vile that the land itself seemed to abandon all hope. And on the eve of his success, with the total conquest of the realm of Forfarmax and the execution of his archenemy, the paladin Andrew ApFittle, Forformax was dragged into the Mists and became Forlorn. The druids felt the land twisting and turning around them, and the human populace twisting into the goblyns that now inhabit the land. And they knew the land was lost. The people left, with only a few druids staying behind to protect their sacred groves.",
								"Now, Tristen directs his goblyns to destroy and decimate the land, believing that only the complete severance of the Forfarian's druids connection to nature will free him from the Mists. Despite war having been waged in this manner for centuries, nature fights back. Strange accidents, freak weather, and carnivorous plants harass the goblyns as they follow Tristen's commands.",
								"Adventures in Forlorn should focus on this sense of desolation. The heroes should see landscapes destroyed by goblyn industry, with foundries churning out the simple weapons and tools used to wage war on nature. And they should see the druids' desperate fight to keep the goblyns and monsters at bay. And this is what adventures should focus on, the continuous fight between the druids on the one side and Tristen's quest to destroy what's anchoring him on the other. Fighting him directly is unlikely unless the heroes come within 300 feet of the central oak at Castle Tristenoira. Perhaps they're hired by the mayor of the hamlet of Forfarmax to clear out the ghosts at Castle Forfarmax or they've been tasked by the druids to help them in the fight against the goblyns. Perhaps they're sent here to attempt to stop Azenwrath at the Black Grove. The slash and burn tactics of the goblyns might even bring them into conflict with Azenwrath and the heroes will have to choose which side to help - which is the lesser evil ?",

Said cleric was later hung, convicted of the murder of the eldest son). The ghost of his wife Isolt can be seen searching the halls at night, looking for her daughter. Everyone believes this is a result of her suicide, but in reality, it was Tristen that did it, striking her so she fell from the walls. The only one missing is Tristen's daughter, Brangain, who vanished after having been imprisoned in the castle's dungeon for over a year.

One of the two original towers has toppled into the caverns and several doors are now crudely bricked over, along with a wooden barbican and wooden rooms for the goblyns to live in.

At night, Tristen becomes a completely different creature. His face becoming haggard and his hair blowing in an ethereal wind, Tristen floats a few inches off the ground and his clothes are torn asunder. He becomes a ghost, the result of a most unusual curse.",

After she recovered, Flora allowed Rivalin to feed on her regularly. Despite her regular loss of blood, Tristen was a healthy baby boy when he was born a few months later.",

Before the ApBlancs could flee the druid's sacred grove, the mob caught up with them. The mob wouldn't touch the druid or Tristen, who was under the druid's protection. Flora and Rivalin were another matter. Tristen watched as his father was beheaded and his mother was lynched on the druid's sacred tree. That night left deep scars on Tristen's soul. Rual tried to raise Tristen as her own and for a few years things were quiet. It changed when the boy was fifteen, and the vampirism that had lain hidden in his blood for so long took control. Rual found Tristen feeding on an animal in the forest. Beyond reason, Tristen attacked Rual in her sacred grove, at the foot of the tree where his mother was slain. The battle was fierce and Rual could have killed Tristen, but couldn't.",

Instead the holy water acted like poison to the young vampyre. As she lay dying, Rual gave into her despair and cursed Tristen. Tristen would never be able to move more than 100 feet from that spot.",
												"Tristen's new life began. Due either from the curse of the druid, the curse in his blood, or the holy water in his veins, Tristen changed. By day he was a vampyre, a living vampire, and with each nightfall he became a ghost. Tristen used his new powers to amass a small army of thugs and set them to raid the nearby villages. His first target was the village whose mob had murdered his parents. The village was burnt to the ground and the villagers sold into bondage. Tristen soon amassed enough wealth to build a castle and purchase a title. He married into an impoverished noble family with a long lineage. Tristen and his wife, Isolt, had three children.",

Any druids captured by Tristen's men were brought back to the castle and brought to a special chamber. None ever emerged. Tristen's cruel temper and raids brought him into conflict with the ApFittle family. The ApFittles were an ancient line of nobles and paladins that objected to Tristen in every way. Tristen was able to employ mercenaries and assassins with the money from his raids and soon was able to grind down the smaller and poorer ApFittle clan. The last ApFittle, Andrew, was captured and brought before Tristen. Tristen had him tortured and executed. Andrew's body had not even touched the ground before the mists closed around the castle."

								"Gundarak and the lord of the land, Duke Gundar are mostly defined by their relationship with one of its neighbors: Barovia. Like that other land, the populace here live in fear of the vampire that rules them, but there are some very significant differences. Strahd rules with a distant touch, one that is firm, but often unseen. Strahd is often seen by the Barovians as harsh but fair, and while some suspect it, very few know that he is a vampire. Gundar is everything that Strahd isn't. Gundar rules overtly with a tyrannical fist that taxes his peasants mercilessly on everything from firewood (the forests are owned by the state, despite being so plentiful) to the birth of a girl instead of a boy. (Gundar believes that women contribute less to the total labor output of Gundarak than men, so families who have girls are punished with a heavy tax. \"Generously\" he gives them 15 years to pay it off, but if it is not paid off by then, he takes the girl away on her 15th birthday. The woman is never seen again.).",
								"Life under the beastly Gundar isn't easy, and only Falkovnians are worse off, as Gundar is a sadistic ruler who balks at nothing to get his way. But his tyrannical ways keep backfiring and his focus on his semi-constant war with Strahd (more on his side as he continually sends Gundarakite soldiers to harass the Barovians, while Strahd quickly disposes of them) has left him exposed and failing to notice the dangers that have taken root at the very heart of his domain. His closest advisor, a vampire named Dr. Dominiani, was working on a way to introduce the Dr. as the darklord of Kartakass. What he didn't know, or even suspect, was that Dominiani was a double agent. In fact, the Kartakass agent that Dominiani was working with was Ariel Lukas, daughter of Harkon Lukas, and they'd intended to double-cross them both. In the end, Dominiani was successful, though Ariel wasn't. Gundar disappeared, and for 4 years Dominiani ruled Gundarak, though he had little interest in the country itself. When the Grand Conjunction happened, the domain disappeared and the lands were absorbed by Barovia and Invidia who invaded the vacant territory.",
								"It cannot be overstated how much Duke Gundar hates Strahd. Like dark mirrors of each other, Strahd is smart and calculating, where Gundar is a beast. Strahd uses subtlety to accomplish his goals, where Gundar uses force. Strahd takes the long view, and Gundar the short view. They do have one thing in common: They despise each other. Strahd views Gundar as an idiot, while Gundar views Strahd as a weakling. Gundar is, unknowingly, far over his head and while he could probably take Strahd in a one-on-one fight, he is so outmatched strategically that he might as well give up. Strahd already has contingencies in place to deal with upstarts and hasn't had to update his plans for how to deal with the Duke in over a century.",
								"This constant war has also led Duke Gundar to outlaw the Vistani within the borders of Gundarak, as he suspects them of being spies for Count Strahd, even if he cannot prove it. Any Vistani found within the border of Gundarak is put to death without question.",
								"Adventures in Gundarak should focus on this dichotomy. The lords hate each other, but the people look at it differently. Barovians are an insular lot, but they feel a kinship with the Gundarakites, viewing them like their poor cousins, the ones who got a worse deal. Gundarakites, meanwhile, are jealous of the lighter hand of the lord of Barovia, and dream of the day where at least their sons and daughters can be relatively safe. Adventurers therefore could enter Gundarak in an attempt to overthrow Duke Gundar or as part of the plot that Dr. Dominiani and Ariel Lukas are brewing. Perhaps they're trying to rescue one of the young maidens that are sent regularly to the Duke's residence at Castle Hunadora. Or perhaps (even likely) they've been manipulated by Strahd into making a move that'll distract Duke Gundar.",

Milak Gundar joined the forces of King Brun to save the kingdom, leaving his young son Nharov and wife behind. When Milak returned two years later, he was missing a hand, and came riding a fine horse,bearing the title of lord. Milak had saved King Brun from an ambitious spearman, at the cost of his hand.

All that changed one night when a stranger arrived at Nharov's doorstep. The stranger offered Nharov a means of revenge. He could slay all the nobles that mocked him, and their numbers would count for nothing. All he wanted in return was Nharov's wife. Nharov agreed immediately, Even as the stranger revealed his long fangs, Nharov had no regrets. When Nharov awoke, he could feel his great strength. He waited until nightfall and then began to move through Navar. Finding nobles, whether by themselves or in small groups, regardless, he slaughtered them all. As he killed the mists arose.",

Dr Daclaud Heinfroth had become a unique type of vampire after transfusing cerebral fluid from one of Gundar's many vampire wives into his own skull.

Gundar was desperate to have a thrall in charge of a second domain and agreed. At a crucial moment, Heinfroth abandoned the duke, and Gundar was slain, with a stake piercing his chest.

However, following the Grand Conjunction, he reversed that particular edict and now encourages the people, whether Mulan or Rashemani, to seek power through magic. He has gone so far as to take a Rashemani as his apprentice (much to the discomfort of the ruling Mulan, though none dare question him), and has built an academy that teaches magic to those with the talent for it.",

The Mulan constantly scheme amongst themselves, and the Rashemani could be a powerful force of rebellion - but they're too cowed to make a move on their own. Power is all that matters in Hazlan, the power to do as you wish. The power to live. And the power of death over each other. And the easiest way to gain that now, is through magic. And magic is of course where Hazlik shines, so using magic potentially exposes the user to the often fatal attention of the Red Wizard.",

The most common of these are the krenshar, dire panthers or tigers, that stalk the plains and kill a lot of farmers each year. The second are the chuul, that hide in the rivers near Sly-Var and grab unwary sailors who stare into the waters from the supposed safety of their boats.

										"Hazlan is a land of little variety. While it has mountains, plains, hills, and such, they all seem much the same. This is due to the relative lack of natural resources in the domain, and while Hazlan has many enormous grain fields, they're often infected by molds and insects, leading the farmers to burn the fields in the height of summer, rather than risk sickness spreading. Similarly, there isn't much in the way of trees, except for a few tangled patches of scrub trees, although the broken forest in the west could be used for timber. Unfortunately, the wood taken from there rots extremely quickly, making it useless for constructing buildings, and it is instead used for firewood. There are two plants that stand out in Hazlik, and both for unfortunate reasons. The first is quøvusp, a mildly narcotic plant. The Mulani use it as snuff and gain little effect from this affectation, but the Rashemani treat it as part of a religious ceremony, where a single person will venture into the wild, build a bonfire, and spend the night smoking quøvusp. This supposedly gives the smoker the ability to see the answer to any question that they're facing, but those non-Rashemani who have tried this simply claim that it makes for a strange experience, but not one that gives any sort of insight. The other plant is the poppy flower, and the juicy milk harvested from it, the milk of the poppy, is refined into opium, and many opium dens are found in Mulan circles, though the Rashemani are too poor for this, and merely use flophouses. There seems to be little consequence to those who partake in this while in Hazlik, as long as it does not affect their work."

Orliab agreed to meet Hazlik in her tower, but it was a trap. Thantosya gathered all Hazlik's enemies together and watched as Orliab served him drugged wine.

While searching the woods one night for a rare ingredient for one of his experiments, Hazlik came across Orliab and Thantosya unaware. Full of rage, Hazlik easily overcame his enemies. Once Thantosya and Orliab were defeated and helpless, Hazlik gave into years of planned revenge. Hazlik tore the skin from Orliab, and made Thantosya drink the blood of her lover, as well as a hundred acts even more terrible. Then, when Hazlik's lust was sated, he slew them both.",

When the mist lifted, Hazlik had been granted the domain of Hazlan. Once Hazlik realized he had been spirited to a realm he couldn't leave, no matter how much magical power he acquired or knowledge he learned, he went mad. For thirty years, Hazlik was the only person allowed to study arcane magic in Hazlan. Any other arcane spellcaster was hunted down and killed. Hazlik passed the time trying to escape Ravenloft.

Hazlik has outwardly accepted his imprisonment in Ravenloft, but all is not as it seems. The Red Academy and the town it lies in, Ramulai, are designed in unusual ways. Arcane casters can sense the power drawn to the area by the design. Ramulai and the Red Academy were designed by Hazlik himself, and some say built by magic overnight. Hazlik tolerates the Iron Faith. As a wizard, he is anathema to many of the faithful, but Hazlik could have the entire church wiped out overnight.

Add to that a rebellious faction of Gundarakites (from the fallen domain of Gundarak that Invidia usurped a part of when Duke Nharov Gunder died - the other half of Gundarak now belongs to Barovia) and Invidia is a hotbed of internecine warfare, with tensions lurking just below the surface in the small realm. Invidia is the story of vendetta, of passions that run high, and of hatred. Originally it was the hatred of the werewolf Bakholis against humanity in general, and his cruel mistreatment of the people he ruled, especially the women. However, Bakholis was murdered by one of the women that he tried his tricks on; Gabrielle Aderre. She was able to overwhelm him with her powers and kill him. She then took his place as darklord of Invidia.",
								"Her hatred of the Vistani is beyond belief and she has both killed her mother (specifically by leaving her to die at the hands of a werewolf) and deliberately sired Malocchio, the dukkar supposedly destined to destroy the Vistani, and raising him with a hatred of the Vistani at least as great as her own. When he came of age (after having been born only a year before), he turned her subjects against her and tried to drive her insane. He succeeded, but she was rescued by her lover Matton Blanchard, a wolfwere from Kartakass that genuinely cares for her, and her newborn child, Lucita Aderre.",
								"Malocchio, meanwhile, is the son of Gabrielle and the fiend known as the Gentleman Caller. He is a dukkar, a man of Vistani blood, one of whom is prophesied to destroy the Vistani themselves. These are usually killed at birth, but his birth outside of a Vistani tribe saved him that fate. Due to his upbringing, he hates the Vistani with a passion and is convinced that he is the one that has been prophesied. And so do the Vistani. Adventures in Invidia should focus on the internal conflict between not only the forces of the two members of the Aderre family but on the conflicts between otherwise reasonable individuals. Passions run high and violent in Invidia, and they're prone to brooding, bitterness, and holding grudges that can claim hundreds of lives and last decades (if not centuries). In many cases, the people involved have forgotten the reasons, but still fight duels of honor (and brawl) over these long-forgotten slights. They love as fiercely as they hate, embroiled in their passions, but this also leads to disaster such as infidelity at the end, leading to more bloodshed. The ex-Gundarakites in the north are more somber and subdued than the southern Invidians, but Malocchio's soldiers are trying to transform them into law-abiding Invidians. Which of course just riles them up more, and among the Gundarakites there is a strong current of revolutionary sentiment, with at least one rebellious leader counting himself amongst Gabrielle's lovers.",

												"Three hundred years ago, Treholan was one of dozens of petty nobles that tore Invidia apart with their squabbling. Treholan differed from the other nobles in his willingness to use intimidation and violence to crush his enemies. Treholan invited several dukes to attend a wedding. One of his daughters was to be wed to one of his greatest rivals' sons. Once all of the guests had arrived, Treholan bade his men attack. Every duke, duchess, and escort was slaughtered in the courtyard of the duke's castle. Treholan quickly dispatched his armies to occupy their lands, lest any distant relation stake a claim. Within a few years, Treholan sat as baron over all of Invidia. To honor his ascension to the throne, he had his great castle, Castle Loupet, built. Nearly one hundred years later, Treholan's descendents still ruled Invidia. The most recent, Baron Bakholis, was the cruelest thus far. Bakholis would ride through the countryside, choosing peasants at random to force into his harem or give to his soldiers. He taxed the peasants mercilessly, with any infraction was met with extreme punishment. Soon villages had more people with missing hands and eyes than those that did not. The only person that Bakholis showed any compassion for was his son and heir.",
												"One night Bakholis took a young woman named Marta. As he tried to flee with his prize, over a dozen men, Marta's fiance Karlus, Marta's brothers, father, and several villagers gave chase. A fight broke out between the men and Bakholis' guards. The men were angry but they were not trained warriors. They were fighting with pitchforks and wood chopping axes. Bakholis' men were trained killers, armed with real weapons and armored in maille. The fight was short. In the end, Marta's father had to sacrifice himself so Karlus could escape. All the village men were dead, and only one of Bakholis' men had been slain. As Karlus fled into the woods around his village, Bakholis ordered every member of the village to be crucified to pay for the life of his soldier. He made Marta watch as every person she had ever known was crucified that night. Then he sent her off to his harem. Karlus soon gathered a small army of oppressed villagers from other hamlets, bandits and refugees. Soon Karlus was able to overrun a few small outposts of Bakholis' troops, and turned his attention to Castle Loupet.",
												"Karlus and his army were dedicated and hated Bakholis, but they were not warriors. Castle Loupet was a formidable fortress, and Karlus couldn't breach the walls. The siege dragged on, and soon disease and famine ran rampant in Karlus' camp. As Karlus' army fell apart, Bakholis and his men attacked. Karlus' army was broken, scattered to the winds and Karlus captured. Bakholis brought Karlus and Marta to his dungeon and suspended over a pack of starving wolves. The lovers were slowly lowered into the pit while Bakholis laughed. While the wolves feasted on the lovers' legs, Marta cursed Bakholis. He would be beast outside as well as inside. She yelled the curse as the wolves devoured her legs. She screamed the curse as the wolves tore into her stomach. Choking on her own blood, she whispered the curse as the wolves ripped into her arms. Bakholis laughed the whole time. Once the wolves had had their fill, Bakholis retired to his chambers. He had a sudden headache and needed to sleep. Bakholis woke the next day covered in blood. Every servant, soldier, and advisor in the castle were but piles of bloody meat. Bakholis seized with a sudden panic, raced through the castle, calling his son's name. He barely registered that the landscape outside the window, while similar to the Invidia he ruled, had changed. He found most of his son in the throne room. His wife had tried to save the child by covering him with her own body. She had failed."

The first is meekulbern, a type of vine that grows only in a few places. It has a sickly-sweet odor, and the berries are a deep crimson.

She failed, but her ruins remain here. From the surface, it is only possible to see the tip of a grim ziggurat that is topped with a statue of a great raven. The raven marks the entrance to the catacombs. It was thought to be uninhabited for a long time, but it seems that the Beast of the Hills is a creature that lives there. It is a hideous female, with black scaly skin, wings, and thin matted hair. Though it looks fearsome, the locals have yet to be able to verify a single instance of it attacking anyone, leading some to speculate if this creature might actually be the opposite of the dangerous wolfweres, in that it looks malevolent, but is benign.

The biggest source of pride to Harmonia is the amphitheater that it is home to, and the source of much of its fame. The amphitheater is carved directly from the rock of the surrounding cliff face and its acoustics are unmatched in the Core. Anyone who takes to the stage and sings can be heard clearly more than halfway through the town. Next to the amphitheater is the Harmonic Hall, the palace widely considered the finest musical academy in the Core, having educated many famous performers over the years.  Finally, Harmonia is home to the Temple of Divine Song, the only known temple dedicated to the Ancestral Choir. It is in poor shape and in need of repair, but the pipe organ has been lovingly restored through the efforts of Tibor Bellock, the baritone lead singer and high priest of Harmornia."

Unlike many other domains, it wasn't created from whole cloth by the entrance of an evil entity into the Mists but was instead ripped from another world by the actions of those who attempted to escape the clutches of the Domains of Dread.",
								"The story starts when an alchemist named Count Strahd von Zarovich, a man of good heart and alchemical knowledge embarked on his greatest undertaking, the creation of a device known as the Apparatus. Of course, within the Mists, the name Strahd has very different tones, and no one knows if this second Strahd (referred to hereafter as the Alchemist) was a byproduct of Strahd's agreement with the Dark Powers. Perhaps this was where the good parts of his soul were sent, while the remainder turned into the Devil Strahd of Barovia. Regardless, on the night where he activated his device for the first time, he broke down the barriers between the realities of the multiverse.",
								"At the same time, Strahd and Azalin were attempting to escape the confines of Barovia, and for a time, all three were caught near Mordentshire and Gryphon Manor in particular. Once the dust of that settled, the two of them had been returned to their domains, and the Alchemist had vanished. And that left the ghost of Wilfred Godefroy as the most powerful force of evil within the land. At the time, he had been hiding from the ghosts of his wife and daughter, who were haunting him, after he killed them and later committed suicide to avoid the haunting. His residence at the time, Heather House, was no longer sufficient and he returned to Gryphon Manor and has since been absorbing spirits and souls, strengthening himself.",
								"Adventures within Mordent are likely to involve Gryphon Manor or Heather House and should feature elements of Godefroy's volatile temper. Crossing him is easy, and annoying him even more so, but he prefers his revenge and striking back to be slow, and instead of merely killing an enemy, will set out to utterly destroy him: mind, body, and soul. Perhaps the group of adventurers is sent here to assist the famed Weathermay family in their pursuit of monsters, and a spirit that they are fighting against is absorbed by Gryphon Manor as the fight draws close to the building. Perhaps they're looking for information on someone who is lost, or perhaps they're here to help cure Lord Weathermay, or strengthen his heir. They may even have been sent as ghost hunters, looking to the famous House on Gryphon Hill, wanting to make sure that earlier adventurers completed the task and drove out the ghosts that the Manor reputedly holds. Of course, those previous adventurers failed, and Godefroy is not likely to make the same mistake twice.",

They hide in the attics of old houses, barns, and in the ruins that can be found around the Mordent countryside. In Mordent, the populace doesn't fear the bats refusing to believe in such things as vampires, though they're all too aware that ghosts are real.

										"Mordent is dominated by the heaths, and the grass that covers it appears to the casual observer to be practically everything that lives in the domain. And to some degree that is correct though only at first sight. The true variety of plant life in Mordent can be found within the ancient deciduous forests. Here all kinds of trees can be found, though willow trees dominate near the waterways. Of special note here though are the bush known as Devil's Tears and a small white flower called Wraithroot. Devil's Tears, or specifically the berries from the bush, are exceedingly hot when eaten, followed by a sweet rush afterward. They're often added to certain desserts and delicacies as a result, where they can be counteracted in the proper way and ensure that the taste comes to the forefront at the right time. Unfortunately, they are the crux of a favorite practical joke among the young of the Mordentish nobility, where the crushed berries are added to an unsuspecting victim's drink or food. Apparently, it is the height of comedy to watch someone trying to cool themselves after a mouthful of the berries. Wraithroot flowers are small, ivory-colored flowers that reflect even the slightest light back on their source. They're often used to make cemeteries where the flowers will lead a visitor past the graves in the moonlight. Locals insist that it looks romantic with the silver glow, but their stories insist that it is bad luck to use the flowers to lead the way home, so they're not used for marking public roads. More specifically, they believe that spirits are bound to follow the lights of the flowers, and if those lead to a home, they'll haunt the house forever."

Encounters with the Headless Horseman are more frequent here than anywhere else in the Mists. There is an exception to this. In a 6-mile radius around Gryphon Manor and Mordentshire, there are hardly any such creatures. Those that do venture here, are inevitably drawn towards the Manor and Godefroy's control. As a result, being here is quite safe, though a few spirits do the work of Godefroy, and they are able to move freely within the area. Special mention must also go to Arden Bay on the west coast of Mordent, where there supposedly is a large sea serpent that rises to the surface during the most violent storms, and who has been blamed for the disappearance of many ships over the years."

When combined with the wind, it gets incredibly cold to be caught in a downpour, even though the domain and temperature might otherwise be quite comfortable. The land is also rather poor when it comes to minerals and stone. As a result, everyone builds their houses from timber and thatch, often using mud and the like to insulate their houses, along with sod roofing. Only the rich can afford to have stone and ironwork as part of their buildings, but even for them, it is sparse. Instead, they use wooden shingles to cover their roofs and show their higher status. Around the domain though are the ruined remains of many older mansions and houses, and these all show a much greater degree of stone and ironwork than even the buildings of the rich. It is as if the land was once much richer, but lost a great degree of mineral wealth when it entered the Mists. Elsewhere, the stones and metals might have been recovered from the ruined buildings, but in Mordent the fear of ghosts is enough to keep people away from them."

Supposedly that last scion of the Halloways may still live there now unless they too have died. The Halloway family was quite wealthy, but their wealth has never been found, and must still be at the House itself. The only way to access the hill and Halloway House is through the use of Smythe's Shadow. Smythe was the ferryman of Steadwall and is the only living resident left in Steadwall. The old man is too stubborn to move and spends his days ferrying people across the Arden River, though he is particularly eager to ferry adventurers to Halloway House, hoping that finding the wealth may help him too. In fact, Smythe is the reason that the Halloway family has died. After killing a young Halloway bride and groom, and dumping them overboard, he was discovered by one of the dreaded Mist Ferrymen. Pleading for his life, he made a deal with the ferryman. He would receive all the riches of Halloway House in return for killing the entire family and guiding victims into the ferryman's waiting hands. He's done so for years, but the wealth eludes him, as he can no longer leave the crossing, making him unable to retrieve the riches and break the curse that the ferryman has placed on him.

He, against all odds, liked it here, and stayed here for a number of years, with his wife giving birth to his daughter. Wilfred was not happy with \"just\" a daughter, wanting a son, and blamed his wife for all manner of transgressions against him, for failing to secure him a male heir. And eventually, his temper led him to murder his wife and child, pinning the blame on his favorite stallion for it, as an \"accident\". While this absolved him of mortal judgment, it didn't free him of the hauntings of his wife and daughter who came back as ghosts and haunted him for almost a year before he finally killed himself on New Year's Eve. This still did not free him of their hauntings, and he fled to Heather House until he became a darklord, at which point he returned. Unfortunately for Godefroy, while his ascent to Darklord gave him great powers, including control over other spirits and undead, it doesn't extend to his wife and daughter, and they still haunt him now, taunting him for his failures and stoking his rage, making it grow ever hotter. The building itself is built in a gothic style, with crenellations and gargoyles on every corner. The roof is made of clay shingles, and in spite of the age and lack of living inhabitants for the last century, it is still in good repair and all the windows are intact (though the garden could use some work). It sits like an angry animal waiting to pounce atop Gryphon Hill, just waiting for the right moment."

												"In the heart of Gryphon Manor lay something evil. The locals shunned the place. The surrounding towns and villages all knew the legends. Gryphon Manor was evil. No one has lasted there for more than a year before fleeing in terror, taking only the clothes on their back and what they could grab in a panicked flight. Then the house would sit empty for a few decades before some other fool moved in.",
												"Lord Wilfred Godefroy inherited Gryphon Manor nearly 200 years ago. Unlike previous tenants, Lord Godefroy found the home quite comfortable. After living there for a year, he arranged to marry Estelle Weathermay, the daughter of a wealthy local, some 50 years his junior. Godefroy was a cruel and quick tempered man, given to fits of rage at his new wife for imagined slights. When his wife gave birth to a girl, Godefroy began to build an insane fantasy. His wife had cheated on him. His wife had cheated to make sure she wouldn't have a male child. The young girl, Lila, was Estelle's heart and soul. Lila was a sweet child that loved unconditionally. Godefroy stewed in his insanity for years before it finally became too much. One night his temper exploded and he beat his wife to death with his walking stick. When his daughter tried to save her mother, Godefroy killed her as well.",
												"Godefroy moved quickly to frame one of his servants. Against someone as wealthy and well connected as Godefroy, the man never stood a chance. He was hanged for murders he never committed within a week. For all the centuries Gryphon Manor had been a nexus of evil, no one had ever taken a life there. When Godefroy killed his wife and daughter something deep in the heart of the house awoke. The night after his wife and daughter were buried, their vengeful spirits appeared and tormented Godefroy. Every night for a year Godefroy was tormented by their spirits. Finally it proved to be too much, and Godefroy committed suicide.",
												"Godefroy haunted his manor for a few years. He was denied the rest of the afterlife, but at least he was free of his wife and daughter. All that changed when the Dark Powers found Mordentshire.",
												"An alchemist moved into Gryphon Manor, seeking to use the terrible power trapped there to activate an arcane Apparatus he had created. The alchemist activated the Apparatus at the same time that Strahd and Azalin opened a portal to Mordentshire. Strahd and Azalin were trying to escape Ravenloft, but instead pulled all of Mordentshire into the Core. The alchemist was slain, and the Dark Powers chose Lord Godefroy as a darklord.",
												"At first Lord Godefroy revelled in his new power. Gryphon Manor was full of spirits and Godefroy wasted no time in making thm his unwilling servants. For one day, Godefroy enjoyed Ravenloft. Then night came and his wife and daughter found him. They came one night as the sun set. They tore at his ethereal form, ignoring his powers and pathetic cries for mercy. Despite this, Godefroy rarely left Gryphon Manor, only going as far as his family vault to check on his body.",
												"A decade ago, a party of adventurers assaulted Gryphon Manor. Godefroy was able to best them, but was nearly slain in the process. The conflict shook Godefroy from his self imposed exile. He used his ability to turn invisible to spy on the moving in Mordentshire. To his horror, he found that the adventures had been around for weeks and openly discussed their plans. Godefroy continued to spy on the living when fortune smiled on him. The mayor of Mordentshire, Daniel Foxgrove, had recently lost his wife, Alice Weathermay. Alice was one of the spirits trapped in Gryphon Manor. Now Foxgrove serves as Godefroy's spy. If Godefroy is disappointed with Foxgrove's information, Alice is punished. If Godefroy is pleased, Alice is allowed to leave the manor and visit her husband for one night."

He forces a spirit to spend its time in one room, cleaning and making minor repairs. Godefroy inspects each room daily. He rages at the spirit if the room is not perfect. If the room is perfect, Godefroy tears the room apart and then punishes the spirit for not stopping him. Godefroy plays the invincible lord during the day, but as the sun sets his demeanor changes. He starts at every small sound. As the terrible screams of his wife Estelle and Lila echo through the house Godefroy flees. No matter where Godefroy hides, his wife and daughter find him.

								"Nova Vaasa is a domain built on duality, where everything seems to come in opposites. The wide plains and steppes are twinned with claustrophobic cities that are almost too narrow for their inhabitants. Nobles and their families are twinned with bandits and raiders. And the noble of heart are twinned with the monstrous, with Sir Tristen Hiregaard facing his opposite in Malken.",
								"Born from the many murders committed by Tristen Hiregaard, from an old curse placed on his father, his personality was split in two upon his arrival in the Mists. The original, Tristen, and his dark opposite, Malken. While not as noble as he would wish, Tristen, at the end of the day, is a good man, cursed by the actions of his father - indeed, should he die and take Malken with him, the curse will pass on to another member of his extensive family.",
								"Nova Vaasa is under the control of both the church and Prince Othmar. Normally the Princedom would circulate between the five great families of the kingdom, with a new prince put into power every five years, but Prince Othmar has managed to retain the power for the past 29 years, using a technicality while Tristen Hiregaard was his regent (back when the prince was young), and with the support of the well bribed Church of the Lawgiver, with Divine First Pieter Jergaar lending enthusiastic support to Othmar, as long as the church is given its due. Even Malken sees this state of affairs as beneficial to him, as it allows him to further expand his criminal empire, while others draw attention away from his endeavors.",
								"All of Nova Vaasa knows of Malken. He has committed hundreds of murders since the creation of the domain, and of his war with Tristen Hiregaard, as it has been well-documented, especially during Tristen's service with the realm's guards. Even after his retirement, Tristen continues to dedicate himself to the pursuit of Malken. It is but ten years ago that Tristen discovered that he and Malken share the same body, and that during his blackouts in periods of rage, Malken takes control and enacts his schemes. Malken understands the state of affairs, however, he does not know that he will be reborn in a different body should Tristen die, and he is not interested in his own death. Tristen would like nothing more than to separate the two so that he can finally kill his nemesis, and for that purpose, he has been exploring ways to split body and soul. Efforts such as Azalin's Doomsday Device and the Apparatus of the Alchemist (in Mordent) have proven of great interest to him. His agents work across the Core to find a cure for his ailment, though they don't know why they are looking. It is unclear if Malken is aware of all the agents that are sent out in this manner, as Tristen has taken steps to avoid the darklord finding out.",
								"Adventures in Nova Vaasa should focus on this duality, or at the very least include elements of it. There should be an element of conflict between two polar op-posites, so a certain amount of friction is introduced. Good should be opposed by evil, nobles by bandits, and so on. While the heroes should not have direct po-lar opposites, perhaps their employer has, or there is some element introduced of opposing interest to spice things up. For example, the heroes could be hired to retrieve a stolen religious artifact for the Church of the Lawgiver in Kantora, but another group has been hired by either an extreme atheist (perhaps from Lamordia) or the Church of the Lawgiver in Hazlan, as the artifact is used in declaring the position of the Divine Fist.",

The \"plains cats\" are a type of leopard that live on the plains. They are extremely aggressive and seem to have outcompeted the wolves that are present in so much of the rest of the Core. They hunt not only other animals but sometimes deliberately target humans, though they avoid larger groups. The horse is the greatest export of Nova Vaasa, and there are multiple breeds present within the domain, as nearly every noble family breeds their own particular kind of horse. The horses of the Hiregaard family are known to be sturdy and strong warhorses, while those of the Bolshnik family are swift horses, built for racing. Most commoners within Nova Vaasa have access to a horse in one form or another, though this usually amounts to a draft horse that their family owns. And it's not always the nearby family that owns it."

										"Nova Vaasa is home to a few crops (wheat, oats, and rye) as well as a few pine trees here and there in various small forests on the western borders of the domain. However, what Nova Vaasa is really known for is grass. Lots and lots of it, and in various types. Dead man's grass grows near Ehrendton, and a fungus infection gives it an unhealthy white pallor, rather than the normal yellow-green hue. Locals believe that it's a sign of an unmarked grave. Sea grass is the tallest known type of grass, and grows in the Pommel, an area in the southern part of Nova Vaasa. Due to the height of the grass, the area is infected by stalking felines such as pumas and plains' cats, who find it easy to hide in. Horse grass grows only to knee height and is common on the Tordenmark (or Thundering Plain). The grass has brown or white seeds that stick to horses like burrs, and the seeds are the source of the name. Knife grass grows only in the Dommark (Plains of Judgment). The grass is only about ankle height but the edges of the blades of grass are razor sharp and will cut through unprotected feet. Horses and other animals avoid areas of this grass, which has led to some farmers cultivating it around their fields (though only while wearing heavy work clothing themselves) Wine grass is short and golden with purple seeds and grows on the Kejsermark (the King's Plain). Due to its color when it is blooming, the thick patches of grass look like a royal carpet, hence why it's also sometimes known as the Palace Carpet."

The lycanthropes, while problematic, are rare, but the Vaasi tell stories of the Death Riders - undead horsemen that rampage across the plains, the remains of horsemen and horses that have died of thirst or exposure. They crave the company of the living, but their mere presence is anathema to natural life. Of more immediate concern to those visiting Nova Vaasa are the bandits. There are many of them, and while bandit lords come and go, there are three that have managed to stand the test of time, and who have built a legacy of their own: Dagfinn the Burner, the Tatters Man, and Chezna the Bloodcat. Dagfinn raids fields and farms, putting both lands and the people to the torch when he's finished with them. The Tatters Man ties strips of his victims' clothing to his band's barding and lances, though some whisper that the strips are not clothing, but truly human skin. And finally, the most infamous is Chezna, the one who obtained the poison that Prince Othmar used to kill his sire. Her band has been active for over thirty years, and she is the only one to regularly raid Bolshnik lands, in retaliation for the prince's attempt on her life following his father's assassination. She's rumored to be a darkling - a cursed Vistani with blood-red hair, one bound to the land but still able to use the terrifying magic of the Vistani."

It lies a short distance outside Liara, and it is not a pretty construction. It is clearly constructed for defense, with stout walls and imposing towers, though unlike many fortifications in the lands surrounding Nova Vaasa, it is not built to intimidate the populace, merely to defend them. Some attempts have been made to \"brighten up the place\" through the use of colorful pennants and banners, with little success in drawing attention away from the sturdy drawbridge or the barbican.",

One of the castle towers stands out from the rest, with the window shutters being even sturdier than the others. The tower rises some 30 feet over the other three towers of the defenses. The whispers of the guards have led the locals to deduce that this is where Sir Tristen retires to, when he is in one of his \"moods\" and needs to get himself back under control. A certain amount of sadness lingers over the buildings here as if the emotion has seeped into the very stones, the result of the murder of Tristen's first wife, and the lovers that Malken has killed along the way. This is not helped by Tristen's current marriage, which is a loveless affair, but one that has borne him four children, who he loves (unlike the half-disdain he has for his wife. Ironically a disdain that seems to be shared by Malken)."

Bergovitsa is under the control of Mayor Araam Tavolys, who is a cousin of the Bolsniks. He's been instructed by Prince Othmar to allow the two families to feud - in some cases, he even seems to encourage this and ensures that even otherwise peaceful overtures between the families are sabotaged. In this manner, the 6,600 folk who call the city home are almost under constant siege.

These two lapses between each criminal's reigns of terror seem to indicate that the two are different individuals, though no one knows for sure. As it is a recent development most still believe Malken to be the Signature Killer - regardless, the Signature Killer is a terrifying prospect for most of Nova Vaasa as he has killed more than 100 women, leaving each dismembered and practically torn apart for the city watch to find. Bergovitsans breathe slightly more easily than others might, as the Killer has only rarely struck here, seeming to favor Kantora (and Liara in recent years).",

This terrified most of the locals so much that they moved to Kantora instead, and for many years, only a few traders dared to brave the miles between Kantora and Egertus. This all changed with the appearance of the Nocturnal Sea in 750 BC, when suddenly Egertus found itself with a shoreline again, and the old quays came back in use (though many required much repair). The people of Egertus were quick to take advantage of this new state of affairs and suddenly found that resources were flowing back from Kantora, through Egertus, and into trade with the realms that had appeared within the Nocturnal Sea. As a result, the small town is now almost back to full strength with some 4,000 souls now calling it home. Egertus had the dubious fortune of being the home of the Clinic of the Mentally Distressed before the disappearance of its entire staff and all the patients in 749 BC. A thorough search and investigation was conducted by the city watch, as one of the recently admitted patients to the clinic was a relative of Prince Othmar, a man who had killed a dozen people and who had gained the nickname of the \"Kantora Strangler\"."

The Great Corral is a gigantic fenced-in area for horse-trading, and, every fortnight, traders from across the Core congregate here for the auctions, hoping to get good deals for strong horses or set up new breeding programs to improve their stock.",
												"Here, and only here in Nova Vaasa, the Vistani are welcomed with open arms and treated well, as they are considered to be expert horse-trainers and breeders, something which is appreciated here. Kantora is also the location of the Prince's Palace (described above), though it's rare for Prince Othmar to be here. Kantora is home to the Mausoleum of the Elect, a series of mausoleums created for the use of the elected Princes. In theory, anyone who dies while wearing the crown of Nova Vaasa, is interred here, but the Church of the Lawgiver often uses this as a propaganda tool. Princ-es who are unpopular with the Church, or considered too liberal by the clergy, are proclaimed to have been struck down by the Lawgiver and denied entry into the Mausoleum. Those who commit suicide (such as Sir Tristen Hiregaard's father who killed himself while wearing the crown) or who die dishonorably are also denied entry."

The watch is attentive and diligent in their duties, though during the day they often have little to do. During the night, this all changes, due to the Signature Killer. The murderer has conducted his business in Liara more often than in any other city in the domain, and the people here live in fear of the maniac striking again.",
												"In spite of this, they have taken an almost aggressive counter-approach, refusing to stay their hands, and during the night Liara descends into depravity, partying as if there is no tomorrow, and alcohol and drugs flowing freely. During the night, visitors would do well to stay indoors unless they intend to find (or be sought out by) trouble.",
												"This strange state of affairs is epitomized by two central buildings in Liara. First, the Passelot is a squat, strong stone fortress, and the home of the City Watch. It is constantly busy with its stables and armory at work at all hours. It radiates an area of calm and watchmen patrol the walls at all hours during the day. Secretly, they hope that all who were sent on patrol at sunset will return unscathed. Realistically they know that at least some of their number will be hurt, but they hope that at least they'll return alive. The other building, the dark twin to Passelot's light, is the Staggering Stallion inn. It is the center of all the criminal activities in Liara and offers everything from alcohol, drugs, and gambling, to beast fighting, and companionship. While none of these are illegal in Nova Vaasa, the degree to which the patrons of the Staggering Stallion engage in the activities is so high that it contributes significantly to the troubles facing Liara at night.",
												"The owner of the Stallion, a man named Canute Dorisz, a fat and (falsely) jolly man who has the hygiene of a swine, claims that he has nothing to do with it. After all, it is all legal. The watch knows that the money generated by the Staggering Stallion ends up in the pockets of Malken, but they've been unable to prove it decisively. Each attempt they've made, where they haven't been 100% certain, has ended in disaster and made the next attempt much more difficult. For now they hold back until they've gathered all that they need. The city watch looks forward to the day that Sir Tristen unleashes them upon the filth they see gathering at the Inn, and they believe that vengeance will soon be theirs. After all, so many of their friends have had their lives taken by the patrons, that it seems only fair to return the compliment."

If his young wife showed even polite interest in another man, he would descend into a rage. The rages became worse as time progressed. One day he found his wife in the arms of another man and killed them both. After the rage subsided, Romir realized the man was his wife's dance instructor. With her dying breath, Romir's wife cursed him. Romir would kill any woman he loved or any man that angered him. Overwhelmed with shame over what he had done, Romir killed himself. The curse passed on to the 15 year old Tristen. Tristen first learned of the curse less than a year later when he murdered the daughter of a servant family. Over the next six years, Tristen killed nine more women. To make matters worse, the more Tristen killed, the more he enjoyed it. Eventually the Dark Powers took notice and pulled Tristen into Ravenloft. When Tristen was pulled into Ravenloft, Malken manifested fully, a raging mad man that was everything Tristen despised. There is no way out for Tristen. If he is killed and Malken chooses to let him die, then the curse is transferred on to his eldest son, Yorgi. The curse that created Malken can only be defeated when the Hiregaard line ends."

								"Richemulot is a land under siege from an invisible threat, an illness that is nearly impossible to cure, and which spreads like wildfire when unleashed. Lurking underneath the city streets, and in the houses of the populace, most know of the threat but can do little to fight against it. In essence, the domain hides the bestial underneath a thin veneer of civility and sophistication.",
								"This disease is that of lycanthropy, specifically that which turns people into wererats. It is also the reason that so much of Richemulot is empty of people, even though it has room for far more. People crowd together for safety, as many as can comfortably be kept in a single building or estate as possible. Ironically the term, rats in a cage, fits only too well, not only for the wererats but also for those that they prey upon.",
								"The darklord, Jacqueline Renier, is cut from the same cloth as Richemulot's original darklord - her grandfather, Claude Renier. But she rules with far more sophistication and charm than her predecessor ever did. And this is where Richemulot truly shines, not in the pestilence of the wererat, the (innumerable) intrigues of the noble houses or the stabbings in back alleys, but in the realm of lost love. Jacqueline CAN and DOES love others on occasion, though she is cursed to assume her rat form in their presence. And inevitable doom soon comes to the bond, twisting it into animosity - often through no action of Jacqueline's. Adventures in Richemulot should feature any and all of these. Perhaps one of the heroes has fallen in love with a noblewoman from Richemulot, but she has been promised to someone else. That person is a wererat in disguise and tolerates no interference from others and sets their pack upon them. Perhaps they're trying to find a cure for lycanthropy for another strain than wererat, but have heard of experts in Richemulot, only to find that the sage has been kidnapped by wererats, and no one knows where they are. Or perhaps, one of the heroes is infected and will soon turn into a wererat, and they're taking the others home as a peace offering to their future family.",

Balihnda is an annis hag of terrible power and rage, who has taken up residence here after a prolonged fight with the famed monster hunter van Richten. While originally she only took up residence here as a temporary measure, she developed a genuine interest in the teachings of Hala, and this interest has tempered her bloodlust to the point where most travelers are hosted amicably and generously while here, often remembering their time with fondness.

The hunters followed the lycanthropes into the sewers and the cornered wererats took a horrible toll, but it wasn't enough.

								"Sithicus is the land of truths. The land of really uncomfortable truths. While many other domains, such as Dementlieu and Richemulot, lie about their presence and seemingly enhance untruths, Sithicus doesn't. It is a domain where all must face their darkest secrets. It imprints itself upon you to such a degree that those with the darkest memories find themselves unable to continue living. It is a land of melancholy, where many have given up hope and dreams, and merely pass the days as best they can. This takes the form of a strange affliction known as the Guilt of Sithicus.",
								"Those who come here find it increasingly harder to concentrate on the matters at hand, and find themselves lost in reverie over the wrongs they have done in the past. Those who have visited Sithicus report that this malaise disappears when they leave.",
								"The inhabitants of Sithicus stand out in more ways than that. They're in the rare position where the elves outnumber the humans in the domain, and they are quick to take this opportunity against the humans. Elsewhere non-humans are shunned and in some cases persecuted, and here in Sithicus, they return the favor, though at least they do not resort to violence. Suffice to say that non-humans find it difficult to find even decent accommodation and food within the borders of Sithicus.",
								"This has become less pronounced after the Black Rose disappeared, especially as Azrael has attempted to increase opportunities for trade with the rest of the world, leading some of the elves to, reluctantly, accept the presence of human traders in some areas. Ironically, those who are not living in Sithicus are treated better than those who do. Sithicus also messes with visitors in a different way than the Guilt of Sithicus.",
								"Before the Black Rose vanished, those who came here found it difficult to navigate, as no matter how many times a visitor saw a particular landmark, it always felt oddly unfamiliar. With the ascent of Inza however, the domain is just as difficult to traverse, but now it is because everything seems familiar instead, as if a wanderer has passed that way before, making them doubt their own judgment on directions.",
								"Sithicus is also a domain that suffers under its ruler: Azrael Dak. The stunted dwarf rides around the land in his chariot, terrorizing the locals in any way he can. Before the Black Rose disappeared, he did the dark knight's bidding, a king in all but name. But his treachery, and working with Inza, when they caused the Black Rose to disappear, also changed Azrael's status. While before he had all the power, but not the title, he now has the title but none of the power. As soon as he is out of sight, the locals ignore Azrael's dictates unless one of the local cronies (of which there are many) are watching - strangely, though it is illegal to know the identity of his agents, most locals do, leading to the populace having to pretend that someone isn't an agent of Azrael, even when they know full well that the person is. This has lulled the elven populace, and especially the aristocracy, into a false sense of security, and they only focus upon the known agents.",
								"Little do they suspect that the cunning dwarf has inserted other agents into their midst, pitting them against each other, and preventing them from working effectively against him. In this manner, he manipulates them into doing his bidding far more often than they realize.",
								"The true power in Sithicus lies with Inza, the Vistana who took control of the shadows and even became a unique one, on the Night of Screaming Shadows. She brooks no challenge, and only tolerates Azrael because he makes an excellent cover for her machinations. Once he is no longer useful or becomes too much of a nuisance, she's likely to get rid of him.",
								"Adventures in Sithicus should focus on the themes of regret and betrayal. Perhaps the heroes discover that Azrael is about to punish one of his agents for betraying him and the heroes will need to rescue the elf, only to realize that they themselves have been betrayed and set up.",
								"Perhaps one of the heroes has committed some grave misdeed, and in Sithicus, one of the spirits takes on the form of a person that they have hurt, and they'll need to face the consequences of their actions. Or maybe, the heroes are foolish enough to take an assignment from Azrael himself, sending them into the depths of the Black Chapel and the Lake of Sounds, in an attempt to eliminate Inza - the only way to survive may be to turn double-agent and then work against the dwarf himself.",

The forests are also home to a number of predators such as badgers, brown bears, and foxes - surprisingly though, despite the neighboring domains of Valachan and Verbrek being home to significant numbers of panthers and wolves respectively, Sithicus barely ever sees any of these cross the domain borders. The elven rangers that patrol the wilds near the settlements sometimes ride enormous stag beetles, bugs as big as a horse - creatures that they control, but which certainly aren't tame.

As devastation rained on his world, he was reborn as a death knight. Soth was bored for decades until he met a general that stirred his cold dead heart. He planned to kill and raise her as his undead consort. As his plan came to pass, Soth and the ghost of his treacherous seneschal, Caradoc, were pulled into Ravenloft. Soth appeared in Barovia and found the Kulchevich family, a Vistani clan. The meeting quickly became hostile. Soth slaughtered the entire family and forced the only survivor, Magda, to serve as his guide. Magda took the death knight to the lord of Barovia, Strahd von Zarovich. Soth and Strahd initially got along, but it did not last. Two creatures of immense pride, both with a desire to rule quickly became hostile to one another. Soth rampaged through Castle Ravenloft and escaped. He attemptedescape from Ravenloft through a portal that he discovered, but was deposited back in Barovia.  After Soth returned to Barovia, Strahd sought out the death knight and offered an appeasement. Strahd told Soth to travel to a neighboring domain, Gundarak and kill the son of the darklord Duke Gundar. If Soth could kill the Duke's son, a portal would open and he could leave. The death knight traveled to Gundarak and stormed the duke's castle. Gundar was forced to flee and Soth killed Gundar's vampire son. Much to Soth's dismay, nothing happened.  Soth was incensed. He returned to Castle Ravenloft and tore through an army of zombies and mercenaries that Strahd had summoned. As the last of his opponents fell, Soth saw Caradoc fleeing the castle. The death knight realized that the ghost must have been in league with Strahd all along. Caradoc fled to the border of Barovia, where he was caught by the death knight. As Soth strangled his seneschal, the mists closed in."

								"The story of the House of Lament is one of pure dread and misery. Originally built some 350 years ago by a bandit warlord named Dranzorg, it was created as a monument to his power. In fact, he was powerful enough that the actual lord of the area, who at that point was an aging man, simply wanted peace for his country, and he offered up his beautiful daughter Mara's hand in marriage, hoping that Dranzorg would lessen his attacks on the local populace. While it did accomplish that, the old man never expected that he'd never see his daughter again.",
								"Dranzorg, instead of waiting for the girl to arrive, attacked her caravan and captured her. He told her of an ancient ritual of his people, where a cat or dog was interred within the foundations of a new building to ensure its strength. And he had a new tower that he'd built. Screaming out her fear and cursing them, the young girl was entombed in the tower.",
								"Dranzorg and his men expected the girl to die within a day, but the screaming continued for weeks. Eventually, the men had enough and begged Dranzorg to release the girl before they all went mad. When the tomb was opened, the girl was gone.",
								"What followed was nothing short of a massacre. Over the next few weeks, one of the soldiers went mad and killed themselves each day. Eventually, only Dranzorg was left, utterly crazed. When he woke in the middle of his last night, he heard the young girl's voice calling \"Mara is lonely\". He went to the still open tomb, sat down, and died.",
								"Mara is still lonely. And she wants company. The power of the House was greatly diminished when it arrived in Borca. Before this, it was able to move be-tween domains, settling itself wherever it wished, but now it is stuck in a single spot. Somehow, in spite of the locals knowing the danger, people still go to the building. And never leave.",
								"Adventures that involve the House of Lament should focus simply on escape and on the desperation that House is feeling. It, or at least the part of it that was Mara, is truly alone and lonely, ever seeking company. But how the heroes arrive within the House will inform their methods. If the heroes simply arrive on a late cold night and find an empty house where they can take shelter from a snowstorm or inclement weather, they will have no idea of what faces them. All they will know is that they cannot escape this strange mansion and that it is slowly getting madder and strang-er. Noises are everywhere as if someone is there - floorboards creak, doors open and close at random, potentially hinting at someone walking around for the heroes to attempt to follow. And when enough time passes, the heroes will slowly realize that the draft from the chimney sounds like someone breathing. A dull regular thumping noise can be heard as well, mimicking a heartbeat. And then they'll realize that they won't be able to leave until Mara gets her due, her chosen one.",
								"Those who enter the House knowing what it is are likely better prepared - they might seek someone lost in the past, or perhaps the House is rumored to hold information that they need. Regardless, they might have some idea of what awaits them, and at-tempt escape through magical means like teleporta-tion or even an exorcism. They might even be suc-cessful, or at least they might think so. The House will not be easily denied.",

										"The House of Lament consists of two different parts. One is an old tower, once part of a much older castle or fort, but which is now long gone. The mansion was added several hundred years later when a now-for-gotten merchant bought the old tower and built the rest of the estate. His choices were odd, to say the least, and quite possibly affected by the spirit of Mara. The windows are extremely tall and narrow, often starting seven feet from the floor, and culminating in a spire 15 feet up, just shy of the ceiling. The rooms on the first floor mostly do not have windows at all, leaving many of the rooms shrouded in darkness.",
										"The mansion itself is furnished as you'd expect from a rich merchant's mansion. The mansion itself is surrounded by a tall, thick, stone wall and it even has a small moat and a (now-dead) kitchen garden. Above everything towers the central tower, where Mara originally died. Well-appointed rooms with bespoke furniture are everywhere, adorned with high-quali-ty artwork. All of the art is subtly corrupted, such as the carved wood nymphs on the two-story curving staircase that is found inside the foyer. The wood nymphs look normal and frolicking at a distance, but up close their faces are contorted in pain and hatred. The same is true of the paintings around the place. Nothing is truly what it seems in the House, as it can change everything at a moment's notice, and doors often lock and unlock on their own. Most worryingly is the one consistent message that all visitors get, whenever a victim has been chosen. Letters scrawled in blood manifest upon a nearby wall with the words \"Mara is lonely\"."

Dranzorg burned her village to the ground and enslaved her people. Mara was taken to Dranzorg's keep and bricked into the wall of the tallest tower. Dranzorg thought this would make his tower invulnerable to attack. Mara's screams reverberated through the castle for days after she should have been dead. When Dranzorg and his men opened her tomb, she was gone. Not long after Dranzorg's men would claim they heard a woman calling to them in the night. Anyone who went to investigate never returned. Soon only Dranzorg remained. No one knows what happened to the bandit lord. The locals fled from the castle and never returned.

Nothing in the domain is ever straightforward, even travel is difficult as the ground is broken apart, and the trees that cover the domain in trackless greenery are ancient, and blot out the sun and sky above.",
								"Here, life is cheap, both for man and for the beast, and neither knows who is the hunter. But above them all rises one beast, one man, and one monster more powerful than all of them. Urik von Kharkov himself. Law enforcement in Valachan is handled by the Black Leopards, a group of soldiers, woodsmen, and essentially monstrous sadists who enforce the will of Urik von Kharkov, including collecting taxes and running the bridal lottery. Each and every one of them is unknown to the populace, werepanthers, or those aspiring to be. Even the name, Black Leopards, is a sly nod to this fact.",
								"Unique to Valachan is their worship of Yutow the Peacebringer, also known as the Dead God. The belief of Yutow is one of unflinching stoicism and endurance of the trials of life. Even the history of Valachan itself is a nod to this fact, as Yutow supposedly died to pacify Valachan. Now his faithful do the same, believing that those who follow the rules will be rewarded, and those who don't will be eaten by animals or swallowed by the mists.",
								"Adventures in Valachan should focus on this man vs. beast theme that's present in the domain. There should always be a feeling of \"Am I in the right here?\" for everything that happens, as adventurers question their own decision-making process, and are forced to reevaluate their own motives. Are they doing what they do for a higher purpose, or have they fallen to some baser desire? And of the danger of arousing the animals to a wave of instinctual anger that you cannot understand.",

										"Redwood is the dominant plant type here, with the huge trees growing everywhere, and providing the vast majority of the limber from the domain. These redwood trees are prized across the Core, due to their ability to repel insects and rot. It is said that anything built from Valachan redwood will never succumb to things like termites. That may be an exaggeration, but they are incredibly resistant to problems that afflict other types of wood. In the north of the domain, there are also a number of cheery, willow, yew, and beech trees, and an impressive array of different ferns that make navigation through the domain difficult. To the south, especially near Ungrad, this turns into an incredible array of mushrooms, toadstools, and various forms of fungi. In the north, barley hops and apples are both cultivated by local farmers, and grow wild. The most successful crop though is wheat, which grows extremely well in Valachan after having been imported from Mordent a few decades ago. The most notorious plant of Valachan is the lily of eternal slumber, also known as Yutow's blood. It can only grow in Valachan and local legends say that it only grows where the god Yutow's blood fell as he pacified Valachan. For 24 hours after a lily is plucked, it is effective against vampires. A wreath of four flowers, when placed around the neck of a vampire, works as if the vampire is exposed to sunlight, potentially killing it, if it is not removed in time. If a lily is placed in the coffin of a sleeping vampire, it'll force that vampire into a deathlike coma, until the lily is removed."

One strange threat in Valachan is the White Fever. A disease that temporarily debilitates those who are infected with it. No treatment has proven effective. The reason for this is that it is not a disease, but the predations of the large population of nosferatu vam-pires in the domain. They're kept in check by Kharkov's power and only rarely overfeed. This prevents the gen-eral populace from realizing the presence of these foul monsters.

It is the richest town in Valachan, a point of contention with those surrounding villages, who all believe that those in Helbenik have forgotten how to do an honest day's work. This is somewhat mitigated by the fact that Helbenik is also closest to Castle Pantara, and as such is the one most often selected for the bridal lottery of the Baron, and also the one that suffers the most from the White Fever. Helbenik is home to two remarkable features: The Gastre, which is a colossal tree that never bears leaves, but each autumn comes alive with scarlet flowers. The locals use the tree as a part of their festivals, decorating it with garlands and ribbons during festivities, to keep its spirit happy. They believe that this spirit is a fertility spirit of some sort, one that grants her boons if she is pleased, and who blights crops if she is not. The other feature is Felkovic's Tower, a near-ruined, blackened heap of decay that was once home to a local wizard. The locals believe (correctly) that the ruin is haunted by the ghost of the old man, who went mad after his wife died from the White Fever. In reality, she was turned into a nosferatu by Urik von Kharkov, and he died following an attempt to kill the Baron. No one knows her current whereabouts, nor that of the weapon, the Cat of Felkovic, that he created to kill the Baron."

The rest of Valachan is under the control of Urik von Kharkov or his minions with almost everyone in power being charmed or dominated by the Baron or one of his underlings. If they're not directly under that control, they're influenced in other ways instead, such as by being bossed around by those who are or simply living in terror of the Black Leopards.",

It is a holy relic that prevents any lycanthropes from entering the hospice (keeping the witches safe from Kharkov's retribution), and which, once per year allows the reader to cast dispel magic (as a 6th level spell) affecting anyone within earshot. In this manner, the witches dispel the enchantments and abilities that are holding the natives captive. Of course, the spells and such are quickly reestablished, but this allows them all to, at times, recall all the atrocities inflicted upon them - which in turn leads to the revolts.",

After a few years he was recruited into the Kargat, Darkon's secret police. Kharkov served in the Kargat for 20 years, becoming a vampire in the process, before fleeing into the mists when his vampire master was slain. Kharkov wandered the mists for a time.

The Cult sacrifices victims to their savage god on the night of the full moon and takes joy in hunting sentient creatures. Disgusted with his father, Alfred left Arkandale at a young age. He wandered Ravenloft for years until he was captured by a group of shepherds while slaughtering their sheep. Alfred was rescued by a Vistani tribe. The Vistani offered to set Alfred free if he swore he would never attack one of them again. Alfred agreed. Once he was free, he immediately tried to kill the Vistani's leader. The Vistani drove him off and forced Alfred to flee into the mists. When the mists cleared he was in Verbrek. Verbrek was south of Arkandale and absorbed that realm during the Grand Conjunction."

								"Castle Island is inspired by two myths from England and Wales. The tales of King Arthur (specifically the Lady of the Lake) and a Welsh mythological creature known as the Avanc. The story of Castle Island combines both, but adds a twist to them as well, meshing them into a new whole. At the same time, it manages to add a tragic and horrific twist to the story of both. The story told here is one of lost love and vengeance gone wrong. The Lady loved the man who became the avanc, but when he died in an accident (after having been cursed to be a monster by a hag), the Lady took vengeance - not on the hag who originally cursed the man, but on the people who had slain what they thought to be a monster. And the way she did it was truly horrible, slowly tearing a family apart, killing the lord of the castle's wife, and watching him die as he realized he had been seduced and betrayed. As he slipped into oblivion, she was taken by the Mists, and the lord was released from what she had intended to be eternal pain.",
								"Adventures centered around Castle Island will be short, simply by virtue of its size, and they should re-volve around the idea of lost love or vengeance. Per-haps someone that the heroes care for heard the siren song of the Lady and disappeared (likely eaten by the avanc), or perhaps one of them descends from the original lord, and they now want to restore the keep, not knowing that it is \"haunted\" by the Lady of the Lake. In order to move here, they will have to deal with the Lady and the avanc both, though likely not at the same time.",

								"Darkon is by far the largest domain within the mists, taking up the northern third of the Core, with a population that is far bigger than any other domain. Ruled by a lich obsessed with the search for power, and his attempts to escape the grasp of the mist, Darkon has in some ways suffered more than any other domain. His attempts to escape have nearly destroyed Ravenloft itself more than once, and resulted in the loss of the capital Il Aluk, to a former underling. Now ruled by Death, and named Necropolis, Azalin has yet to establish his capital elsewhere, continuing instead to rule from his seat of power at Castle Avernus, where he continues to rule, disguised as a mortal man. The ruler of Darkon is the wizard king Azalin Rex - a careful illusion crafted by the real Azalin, who is a lich. While he appears as alive in his guise as the king, many suspect that he is not, and his agents most often know the truth. Darkon itself is an extension of both his powers, but also of his limitations. Those who visit Darkon for more than three months find themselves losing their memories and becoming other people (they can regain their memories by leaving once more, but with their new personalities, they most often do not want to). While this allows Azalin to more easily manipulate the populace, it also reminds him of his own limitations and how he's not able to acquire new spells, even if he has become a master at manipulating the ones he already knew. No discussion of Darkon is complete without mention of the Kargat. These are the spies, assassins, and secret police of Azalin, both in his formal rule of a king and in his informal rule as a powerful undead. Many of the Kargat are undead themselves, led by Lady Kazandra, Beryl Silvertress, and Venrith Chole - the first two of these are vampires, while the last is a werewolf. The Kargat also employs plenty of living agents, but only the undead or truly monstrous make it to the top of the Kargat. All must be able to pass off as living in one form or another. Adventurers in Darkon should rarely tangle with Azalin as he is far too powerful for most to handle, especially with his ability to modify the memories of anyone in his domain and control the hordes of undead here. Instead, heroes are far more likely to run into the Kargat, and stories of memory loss and forgotten trinkets and objects should abound, as such intrigue and the theme of escapism from not just Darkon but the Mists in general. Adventures should focus on the accumulation of knowledge and power, in a similar vein to Azalin himself. While they shouldn't run into him, perhaps they're working for one of his agents in trying to obtain a rare spellbook or some strange components that Azalin needs to complete a new experiment. Or perhaps they're trying to find a friend who is in Darkon, one who stayed for more than three months and lost themselves. Or perhaps, the heroes themselves are beginning to drift from their memories, and they're now in a race against time to escape.",

										"Within Darkon, there are two types of areas: Those that have been civilized, and those that have not. The throng of humanity overrun certain areas, especially near the cities, to the point that there are no large predators as they've been hunted to extinction by the locals. The most dangerous native creature that you're likely to encounter in that area is a rabid dog. In the wild regions, bears and wolves are common, while the waters off the Darkonian coast have a relatively high amount of sharks, attracted by the readily available food supply from the coastal cities, especially near Rutledge. Even in the wilder regions though, large animals are rare, with deers being the biggest ones commonly found. Smaller animals, like birds, rats, rabbits, and the like are far more easily found. In the Mountains of Misery, in the south and south-eastern parts of Darkon, large spiders are rather common, to the point where the locals often have a small bounty going for anyone able to take down some of the spiders."

										"Darkon, due to its sheer size, has great variety in the plants found within its borders. The trees are mainly deciduous, though conifers are the majority near the border with Falkovnia (though they do not have the black bark of their Falkovnian cousins). There are a number of fruit trees in Darkon, mainly pear and ap-ple trees, but only the apple trees are considered useful by the locals. Pears are a \"poor man's fruit\", eaten or fermented only by those who cannot afford better. Apples are often used as a food source, and Darkon is well known for an extremely potent apple wine that the locals near the smaller towns bottle. Near the larger towns, the fields are dedicated to various types of grain, with wheat being the main harvest. Darkon is also known for two distinct types of plant: Spuma Vitae and Somnos Berries. Spuma Vitae is a type of algae that when devoured causes the body's system to close wounds at an astonishing rate. When eaten, the imbiber regenerates one hit point per round, but once reduced to zero the regeneration stops. If a creature dies within a week of imbibing the algae, the algae that are left in the system infect the body, preventing it from being resurrected. A week after death, the body turns into a vine blight. The somnos berries are used for a type of wine that causes the imbiber to lose their inhibitions - the wine, as a result, is illegal within Darkon, but the berries are too plentiful to be eliminated. Instead, certain homemade distilleries and smugglers still brew the wine and then sell it in places like Dementlieu and Richemulot."

The undead are so prevalent, and so under the control of the darklord, that they have become known as the Eyes and Ears (and Voice) of Azalin, capable of bringing information to him from with-in anywhere in the domain. Less known, but perhaps more horrifying than the undead is the memory loss inflicted on those who spend time in Darkon. Within the space of three months, the memories of any creature in the domain are modified, so that they always believe that they have been a resident of the domain, and often ignore signs that should tell them otherwise.",

There are two exceptions to this: Anyone who lives in Martira Bay is apparently immune to this effect, and anyone who vis-its regains their lost memories. This means that the city tends to be overrun with those from elsewhere, who desperately cling to their true memories and person-alities, afraid of losing themselves upon leaving. (Of course, those actually from Darkon are unaffected, and believe these to be tall tales).",
										"The other group of unaffected are those rare few who have visited Castle Avernus and somehow gained access to its vast library. Hidden within this reposito-ry of knowledge is said to be a book (called the Book of Names) that contains the true memories of anyone who has ever been in Darkon, and had their memo-ries changed. Upon touching the book, the creature re-gains all its lost memories and becomes immune to the mind-altering effects of the domain. Only an extremely rare few adventurers have survived the trek to Castle Avernus, and many of them have died subsequently. They report that while they can read the stories of oth-er people, and see if they did indeed have a past (as well as their true name), but were unable to regain the memories of others."

												"Sitting a few miles south of Il Aluk, Castle Avernus is the lair of Azalin. Named not after the first layer of Hell, as so many outsiders believe, but because of a peculiar property of the castle that means that only a few types of bird (named avis in Darkonese) will fly over the castle, such as vultures, crows, and ravens. Any other type of bird that flies over simply drops dead as soon as their shadows hit the spires of the castle. Castle Avernus is built as a defensive fortification. The windows are narrow arrow-slits, about six inches wide, allowing the defenders to see out while remaining protected. The spires, while appearing ornamental, actually give a commanding view of the countryside and are sturdily built to withstand a siege. And on the walls of Castle Avernus patrol Azalin's doom guard - armored skeletons and zombies, though he keeps the more outrageous types of undead out of sight. Here is where Azalin holds court when he wishes to do so, and there are even chambers for living guests. It is rare for Azalin to have company unless it is a captive either being interrogated or used for magical experimentation. During the night, visitors can hear a spirit moaning from the tallest, central spire, and while it tugs at their life strings, it is too far away to affect them. Anyone inside the castle buildings (apart from the central spire) cannot hear it - unless they are of elvish descent, in which case they hear it far more clearly than anyone else. Underneath Castle Avernus lies the best-kept secret of Azalin, even beyond the location and nature of his phylactery. It used to be the lair of Ebb, a shadow dragon ally of Azalin. He maintains the pretense that she still lives there, but in fact, she has moved to the Mountains of Misery to be with her mate Gloom. They keep the fact that there are two of them secret by only venturing out one at a time. And known only to Ebb, Gloom, and Azalin is the fact that they have eggs, and that these are about to hatch."

Instead, the Forgotten Hills have become far more dangerous as they're inhabited by brigands, bandits, and monsters who often prey on merchants and travelers heading to and from Nova Vaasa. Azalin has yet to take action against them. There are a few ruined buildings left, following what appears to be a side effect of the Scouring of Arak (see Keening for more), but otherwise, the original Arakian population has vanished.

She affects reality around her in such a way that the memory loss that visitors and inhabitants suffer elsewhere in Darkon falls away here, in a similar manner to them leaving the domain. This makes it very difficult for him to directly influence events there (at least in a subtle manner), though he still has full control over the undead there. Styrix is also the builder responsible for an artifact known as the Rift Spanner - a device that may be of interest to Azalin's ongoing attempts to escape. So far, it has not been activated and remains hidden somewhere within the city. The local Kargat is led by Lady Kazandra, a beautiful and cunning woman with a rakish eyepatch. She owns the Cosmopolis Club, a posh club in town (and a suspected brothel, but nothing's been proven), and is influential behind the scenes, though the local ruler, Baroness Karimana Reldkasen, has firmly rebuffed attempts to control her directly.

The inhabitants here are capable miners and many of their products make it to the center of Darkon, though it is not as common as the products of Temple Falls, especially as recent washouts, rockslides, and more, have rendered access to the town impossible to reach, except on foot. Once the Strigos road is completed, it is expected to pass through Sidnar, and give the city a significant trade boost."

Tempe Falls is home to the Nova Vaasan embassy (the chief envoy is Myar Hiregaard, the son of Tristen Hiregaard - one of the few who have retained their memories, on the command of Azalin). It is also the home of Geraldine Enrich, an elderly human woman who has completely immersed herself in dwarven culture, and who runs the well-guarded Geraldine' Gem Emporium that sells figures made from the gems mined beneath the town. She even worships at the Ancestral Vault, the local dwarven temple."

Unknown to the locals, Glennis is actually a green hag, who is trying to subvert Viaki, in revenge for the murder of the rest of her coven - only the woman named Isha Goldtree (who the locals call the Lost Seer, for her supposed ability to foresee the future) knows the truth, of which she's failed to convince anyone else.

												"Firan Zal'honan was the second son of Duke Tiralitan Zal'honan, a minor noble in a forgotten world. At birth his prospects were bleak, Firan couldn't inherit land and he did not have the strength of arms to join a company of mercenaries. The duchy was small and surrounded by hostile tribes of humanoids. The young noble respected his father and older brother, Ranald, but had no love for them. The only person Firan developed any connection for was his younger brother Irik. Irik was kind and slow to anger. He was the only person who could calm Firan's temper when the young noble lost control. Firan's father hated magic in any form and forbade it in his lands. At first Firan respected his father's rules and avoided magic, but as he grew Firan realized magic offered him what nothing else could, control. The discipline necessary to study the arcane arts gave Azalin control over himself and the spells he studied gave him control over others. As Firan grew in ability he realized another desire magic could achieve. Power.",
												"Firan soon confided in Irik about his arcane pursuits, the pair soon joining together in studying under the wizard Quantarius. Quantarius was a powerful wizard who kept to the shadows to avoid the wrath of the boy's father. Firan mastered magic quickly, but soon his grasp exceeded even his considerable reach. When he was 15, Firan and Irik tried to summon a fiend. The fiend quickly overpowered both of the young mages and went on a rampage. Quantarius was able to slay the fiend, but not before Irik lost his life. Quantarius had saved the duchy, but was outed as a mage, and banished. Firan chose to follow Quantarius into exile and continue his studies.",
												"Over time, Firan mastered powerful magic. He could drain the vitality of others to extend his life and heal his wounds. He could steal spells from the minds of other mages and learn them in an instant. Firan studied dark magic and soon moved beyond what Quantarius was willing to teach him. When Firan studied on his own he learned even faster.",
												"During his exile, Tiralitan died, and Ranald inherited the duchy. Under Ranald's rule his people suffered. Ranald was a harsh and petty tyrant who drank and whored the treasury to nothing. The people suffered, both from Ranald's drinking and from the raids of the surrounding tribes. Constant drinking and feasting took its toll on Ranald and within a few years he passed. Firan returned from exile as an Azal'Lan, a Wizard King.",
												"Azal'Lan was a harsh but fair ruler. Magic was embraced and Azal'Lan conducted a series of brutal mercenary campaigns against the neighboring tribes. His duchy became powerful militarily and economically. His people procured, as long as they obeyed. Anyone who broke the law was severely punished, even Azal'Lan's own son, Irik. Irik, like his namesake, was a kind soul. When Azal'Lan imprisoned several political prisoners Irik led a doomed attempt to free them. Irik was tried for treason and found guilty by his own father. While Irik's conspirators and the prisoners were executed by a headsman, Azal'Lan beheaded Irik himself. After the death of his son Azal'Lan became obsessed with immortality and restoring his son to life. He would race toward any hint of new magic to add to his immense library. It was a shock when the secret to lichdom was offered to Azal'Lan by a shadowy figure in his own lab. Azal'Lan was wary, but could not resist the power undeath offered. After his apotheosis, Azal'Lan ruled for decades, greatly expanding his territory and power. Despite the decades Azal'Lan still desired to resurrect his son. One day a traveller told the lich king of a new magic that would bring the dead to life without the interference of the gods. Azal'Lan took a small retinue of guards and set off after the rumors. Once outside of his duchy Azal'Lan and his guards were ambushed by a combined force of tribal warriors and mercenaries. Azal'Lan's guards were slaughtered but the lich was more than a match for his assailants. He laughed as he drained their lives away, dissolved their bones, and shattered their minds. As the last tribeman died the mist came for Azal'Lan.",
												"When the mists cleared Azal'Lan was in Barovia. The first person he met mispronounced his title as Azalin. It was a name Azal'Lan quickly adopted in his new home. Azalin traveled for a time and eventually found Strahd von Zarovich, the lord of Barovia and the only creature in Barovia that Azalin could consider an equal. Even then Azalin knew he could kill Strahd if he so wished. Azalin stayed at Castle Ravenloft for years. He quickly learned about his prison and began to experiment with the nature of the demiplane and the Dark Powers. One of his earliest experiments involved creating the arcane machine, the Apparatus, that opened a portal to Mordent and in the chaos that followed dragged the entire country through to become a new dark domain. After the experiment failed, relations between Strahd and Azalin, already strained, reached a breaking point. Azalin knew he could destroy Strahd, but was concerned Barovia would dissolve into the mists with the death of its lord. Because Mordent had been pulled into the mists and now lay outside of Barovia's borders, Azalin deduced that new countries may exist or be created in the mists. Azalin left Castle Ravenloft and walked into the mists. He was gifted the realm of Darkon. For a time after the creation of Darkon, Azalin was split into two beings. Firan was a mage who couldn't remember anything about himself. Firan helped those in need, but felt pulled to Castle Avernus. There Firan fought and defeated a powerful undead entity called Daraculas. When Daraculas was slain, its undead essence merged with Firan and Azalin was reborn. At first Azalin raged against the Dark Powers and swore to break free of their control and get his revenge. After some time and research, Azalin has come to believe that the Dark Powers had granted him a chance as Firan to escape Ravenloft and return home. Azalin established his rule at Castle Avernus, but the nearby city of Il Aluk became the political and economic center of Darkon. While exploring the castle, Azalin found the crypt of his son, Irik in the catacombs beneath the castle.",
												"Azalin himself is unsure, but at some point after he was taken by the mists, he lost the ability to learn new magic. Azalin remembers creating new types of golems and researching the complicated magical rituals for his first attempt to breach Ravenloft. He also remembers teaching Strahd the spells needed to activate the Apparatus. Azalin's memory changes every time he tries to remember, and interrupting one of these reveries is a sure way to die a painful death.",
												"Azalin quickly established his rule in Darkon. He assembled the Kargat, a secret police of human informants, werewolves, and vampires, charged with crushing dissent and ferreting out spies. Over the years the Kargat expanded their activities to carry Azalin's will to other domains as spies and assassins.",
												"Azalin continued his research into the nature of the demiplane of dread. He tried to escape several times, all of which have failed. One such attempt, now called the Grand Conjunction, nearly tore the demiplane apart and reordered the domains that were trapped. His most recent attempt, the Requiem, drained the life force of an entire city, Il Aluk, and created a new dark lord, Death. The events of the Requiem were supposed to grant Azalin enough energy that he could break free of his corporeal body and escape Ravenloft. Instead Azalin's body was blasted apart and his mind scattered across Darkon. Azalin struggled to reassemble his mind for five years. Finally Azalin could possess the body of his son and be reborn."

If a creature attempts to fly over the horde they are forced down to the ground by an invisible force. Any attempt to teleport past the horde partially fails. The creature is instead teleported into the middle of the undead horde. Undead near the border inerrantly know the location of creatures Azalin does not want to leave Darkon, and the undead relentlessly assemble and attack in greater and greater numbers until the targets turn back from the border -- in which case they are harried no further. Azalin himself doesn't automatically learn about attempted escapes of creatures he forbade from leaving Darkon, but he is likely to receive reports of an unexplained mass rising of undead and put two-and-two together."

								"Dementlieu was built in France during the Renaissance amid the machinations and infighting that were common among the nobles of that time. As a result, it is highly civilized and technologically advanced (one of the most advanced domains in existence), and outwardly claims to be a republic. In reality, it is run by Dominic d'Honaire. Dominic is the darklord of Dementlieu and prefers to remain the \"power behind the throne\" of his puppet, Marcel Guignol, an old man too feeble to defend himself from Dominic's mental onslaught. Dominic has no real ambitions of expanding his domain and spends his time setting his subjects upon themselves through his manipulations and schemes. However, he is being challenged by a newcomer to the domain, the Living Brain. The Living Brain is a brain that somehow survived the care of Dr. Mordenheim and was transferred from its body into a waiting receptacle, a glass jar, with mechanical legs. The Living Brain escaped and found that its unlocked mental powers made it a formidable foe for Dominic.  Adventures based in Dementlieu should contain an element of manipulation. The heroes should always feel like someone is trying to pluck their strings and control or direct their actions. They might get involved in the power struggle between Dominic and the Living Brain, and while they might attempt to avoid getting entangled, this should prove difficult at best. Dominic is likely destined to win this battle, as his powers are stronger than that of the Living Brain, but it has emerged as the first real contender that Dominic has ever faced. Furthermore, if any of the heroes is an attractive female, they should be able to see the true monster that hides behind Dominic's smiling visage, even if the rest of the heroes might never discover it.",

Gardening is a popular pastime among the Dementlieuse, with frequent competitions held to show off the wealth of the nobles, by having unusual and exotic plants imported, but even among commoners, there is a sense of pride with these. Here they grow colorful flowers and spices that they use to liven up their food, and popular spices include lavender, thyme, rosemary, hyssop, and marjoram. One plant, in particular, deserves special mention here, a herb called dapplewort. It seems capable only of growing in the wild, as all attempts to cultivate the plant have failed. As it grows on the sandy dunes of the western shore, a select few of the populace make a living harvesting the herb, and supposedly disposing of it safely. Ingesting dapplewort makes the recipient susceptible to manipulation of both magical and mundane nature, and rumor has it that some of the nobles use this to lure secrets out of their rivals. Dapplewort is easy to recognize, as the flower is a beautiful pink, with a yellow center. The yellow center is the seed of the plant, and once it has swollen to its full size, it can be squeezed, and a thick fluid that tastes like honey can be harvested. This fluid is what has the intoxicating effect, leaving many locals to harvest the seeds early, destroying them, and then simply enjoying the view. Or so they say..."

								"Falkovnia draws upon several sources of inspira-tion. The main source is the story of the actual Dracula of history, i.e. the man known as Vlad Dracul (the Son of the Dragon), Vlad III, or most infamously, Vlad the Impaler. Along with this are inspirations that hail from the fascist regimes of both Hitler and Stalin (in the way that he suppresses the populace of Falkovnia). Finally, and most well-hidden is his inspiration from Alexander the Great, in his insatiable lust for conquest. The quote (which, incidentally isn't correct) that sums up Vlad Dra-kov is the one that Hans Gruber mentions in Die Hard: \"And when Alexander saw the breadth of his domain, he wept, for there were no more worlds to conquer.\"",
								"Here though, Vlad is even more frustrated. He can SEE the domains around him, but he cannot ever conquer them. Adventures in Falkovnia should run into these points. The populace should be oppressed by the mil-itary, with everyone being a potential recruit. They're suspicious of everyone, and try to avoid attracting the attention of the soldiers, who are above them in status. The masses are treated little better than slaves, and all their labor is owned by the state (and the state IS Vlad Drakov). But they're so indoctrinated into a cult of ha-tred, that they hate and fear foreigners, outsiders, and those of other races, seeing themselves as inherently superior, despite their harsh lot in life. This should be evident in all interactions with the natives of Falkovnia. Furthermore, the heroes should constantly be remind-ed of the Hawk's cruelty and find that all lawbreakers are punished harshly, with even relatively minor infrac-tions being punished with impalement. The populace is poor, overworked, and underfed, in spite of the fertility of the land around them. Only the barest minimum of food is distributed to the locals, while everything else is exported to the domains around Falkovnia, in return for the coin that the Kingfuhrer required to keep his war machines running.",

Wolves and bears can be found here too, though as with other animals they sometimes reach an extreme size, known to sages as Dire creatures. Hunting birds are extremely common here as well, especially hawks and falcons. Crows and ravens are a common sight in the domain, due to the proliferation of the unburied dead - a result of the harsh laws of the domain. They're so common and so associated with the dead that they feast upon, that the populace sometimes refers to them as the \"dead birds\".

However, while the land is covered in lush forests, it is mostly known for its rich crops. While the fields themselves are relatively small compared to the size of Falkovnia and its forests, they are incredibly fertile and grow far more crops than Falkovnia needs to feed its own people.

Generally speaking, they're a minor threat, but they re-main one of the most effective resistance movements in the country. No one is sure what is the cause of the other problem: a strange mutating disease known as the Blight.

The soldiers and officers that are stationed here know that they are under the watchful eye of Vlad Drakov himself, and as a result, they're much harsher in their enforcement of his laws than anywhere else in the do-main. This results in nearly a quarter of the city being in a state of ruin and ashes, after the various punish-ments and pogroms of the soldiers. The city itself is built with an eye for defense, with each of the city's districts walled off separately, though this is more often used as a means of quarantining and detaining parts of the civilian population by the soldiers, than for defense. In fact, apart from Drakov's own campaign when he conquered the domain, Lekar has never fallen to en-emy hands, nor even been threatened. Lekar is also home to a large number of vampires that hide under the protective cloak of the Slumlord Vladimir Ludzig, who owns a large portion of the buildings in Lekar, all with the implied protection of the Drakov family. Lekar is also home to the Radiant Tower - the only place in Falkovnia that is openly receptive to practitioners of arcane magic. Drakov innately distrusts magic but has in recent years realized that he needs such methods to combat the lords and ladies surrounding him, so while the tower in years past was a dilapidated ruin, today its white walls rise above the city, striking even more fear into the populace than in the past."

Now instead it sits on the edge of the Shadow Rift, diminishing a little in trade importance every day. Fortunately for Morfenzi, it is unlikely to ever fade entirely from prominence in Falkovnia, even if its influence is diminished, for the reason that almost all Falkovnian livestock is slaugh-tered here, in one of the many abattoirs that fill the city. It is named Butcher's Burg for this simple reason. The region is also home to the finest livestock in all of Falkovnia and the Northern Core. The amount of live-stock that passes through Morfenzi has led to a local custom of bringing animal totems out into the streets in the morning, to ensure that the animals stay calm when being brought to the butcher's block. At night they're taken back into the houses and placed in po-sitions of honor to placate the spirits themselves. The vast amounts of animals being butchered in Morfenzi mean that the city is constantly surrounded by a mi-asma of death, with vast mounds of dung and animal blood clogging the streets, while the stench of tanner-ies fills the air. All this is coupled with enormous clouds of fat flies that are a constant reminder of the city's claim to fame.

Azalin hasn't even bothered to send an envoy demanding an end to the attacks or asking for peace. It seems no matter what Vlad does, Azalin hasn't even noticed him. Vlad takes this out on the people of his domain. He demands at least one execution a day, and eats his dinner while watching his victim being tortured to death. On special occa-sions Vlad will have as many as forty people execut-ed. His favorite method is impalement, but Vlad is al-ways on the lookout for fascinating new ways to slowly and painfully kill. Falkovnia is the breadbasket of the Domains of Dread, and Vlad could starve the armies of his neighbors by the simple act of just not sending them grain. Vlad will never even consider this, as to his mind that is how a coward conquers."

Those who come here, prepared, face fates even worse than that in the af-terlife. Adventures in Keening should focus on sorrow and loss. Coming here, without being willing to sac-rifice an orphan is to invite death. People only rarely come here, and only then if they believe that they can find something of interest in the ruins of civilization. Perhaps the heroes have come here to find infor-mation that was lost when Tristessa fell, or perhaps they're seeking information on the Spider Queen's worshipers. If Tristessa could be made to listen to reason, she could prove a font of great knowledge. Of course, convincing an insane banshee of this is no easy task.

After the interrogations they either let the living con-tinue on their journeys, or they attack. There seems to be no rhyme nor reason behind which outcome it is, though those who bring a new-born child with them are inevitably brought to Tristessa.

										"On these lower steps it is worth looking out for two types of moss however, as these, while edible, are dangerous to the unwary. The first is wasp sting moss, which is a pale green and yellow patch of moss that in tiny amounts contains enough nutrients to sustain an average human. Unfortunately harvesting the moss (or even just sticking a hand into it by accident), will embed tens of crystalized needles into any exposed flesh. (A creature touching wasp sting moss must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 4 (1d8) piercing damage and is poi-soned for 24 hours. On a successful save, the crea-ture takes half damage and isn't poisoned. Ingesting it is safe, if cooked - if eaten raw, the DC increases to 14, and it deals 8 (2d8) piercing damage.).",
										"The other danger to be aware of is trollflesh spores. These are a small deformed brown mushroom that grows in patches between three and five feet across. Anyone disturbing a patch (such as by walking through it), runs the risk of going mad from delusions. Each patch takes a week to regrow its spores, so if it is disturbed by one creature, it is safe to disturb for up to seven days, after which the spores have matured once more. (Anyone disturbing a patch of trollflesh spores must make a DC 14 saving throw. On a suc-cess nothing happens. On a failure, the creature is affected, and after a week starts to develop the effects of infinite madness (as per page 260 of the Dungeon Master's Guide-the Dungeon Master should choose a specific madness that fits the character, rather than rolling one at random. The nature of Keening means that most types of madness developed here will be dangerous, either to the victim or those around them). Apart from these two, there is only one more plant of note in Keening - a small delicate flower known as wilting roeby, which grows on the border of Keening and Tepest. It is a pretty little yellow flower, with a sweet scent. However, it instantly wilts when brought within ten feet of the undead - i.e. not many speci-mens survive further into Keening."

The Arakans enjoyed toying with the hu-mans, pitting them against each other in endless cruel schemes. Tristessa was the sister of the domain's king, Loht. Things changed when three outsiders entered Arak. The outsiders, drow elves, looked similar to the shadow fey and were comfortable in the cold lightless tunnels the fey called home. Tristessa, Loht, and the shadow fey welcomed the drow into their kingdom, and the three, lost and harried on the surface because of their appearance and obvious inhuman blood, readily accepted. The drow brought their faith in their venom-ous spider queen, Lolth, with them. The drow quickly be-gan to convert shadow fey to the worship of Lolth, start-ing the Church of the Spider Queen. In a few months hundreds of shadow fey had converted to the worship of their dark queen. The shadow fey that converted to the worship of Lolth began to resemble the drow that led the church, their skin often becoming purple or jet black, and they covered themselves in stylized web and spider tattoos. Loht, sensing a threat to his pow-er and seeing the danger of the growing power of the church, decided to act, but the magic of the shadow fey stayed his hand. The oldest law of Arak was called the Law, and Arak and it was sealed with ancient magic.",
												"This law forbade any shadow fey from directly slaying another shadow fey. Because of the Law, the politics and fighting of the shadow fey was always subtle. The fey rarely acted directly against each other, working through hired agents and glamoured minions. Although Loht could not move directly against the shadow fey who had fallen to the Church of the Spider Queen, he was free to move against the drow, who were quickly slain. Tristessa took control of the cult and the war be-came a bitter family feud. For decades the war raged in silence in the kingdom of Arak. Despite her best ef-forts, Tristessa was slowly losing. She begged Lolth for aid, but the Spider Queen was neither willing nor able to help. As the noose tightened around Tristessa and her remaining followers, Lolth sent Tristessa a miracle. Tristessa gave birth to a baby girl with spider legs. Her followers demanded to know who the father was, the doctrines of the Church of the Spider Queen required the father to be sacrificed to Lolth. Tristessa insisted there was no father and the baby was a gift from Lolth. The cult shattered and Loht was finally able to wipe the Church of the Spider Queen from his kingdom. After de-cades of bitter warfare, Loht had nothing but contempt for his sister. So great was his hatred, he broke the Law of Arak and staked Tristessa and her child out on the slopes of Mount Lament, so they would be turned to ash by the morning sun. As the sun scorched the flesh from her bones and her baby wailed in agony, Tristes-sa brought down a powerful curse on the kingdom of Arak. A sandstorm descended on the surface kingdom for over a year. When it finally abated, the kingdom, every human, animal, and building was gone, as if they never existed. The Arakans were largely unharmed, but the surface had become a barren wasteland. On the slopes of Mount Lament, a figure stirred. Although she had been burnt by the hated sun and lay inside a terrible sandstorm for a year, Tristessa still moved. Her body was gone and only her hate-filled psychotic spirit remained. In death, she had become a banshee, and the mountain where she had died became her domain. To her horror, Tristessa's child was missing. There was nor sign of the child or her body. Tristessa scoured the mountain, but to no avail. Her cries of pain and rage echoed from the slopes of Mount Lament."

								"Lamordia is the stronghold of science in Raven-loft. Its people believe in rational thought above all else, to the point where they eschew all forms of reli-gion as superstition and view magic simply as \"science that we don't understand yet\". Ironically this belief has such strength that it affects magic in Lamordia with an effect known as \"The Dakj Fe'nunft\" (the Dark Reason) where magic is suppressed around a crowd of Lam-ordians. If in the presence of more than ten Lamord-ians (and within Lamordia) a spellcaster must make a Concentration check to successfully cast any spell, as the strength of the Lamordian belief tries to dispel the presence of magic. Lamordia is not only the stronghold of science but also of weapon development and med-icine. They were the first domain to introduce firearms and have developed medical procedures that students and healers from across the Core come to learn. Vlad Drakov of Falkovnia regards them as an object of hate, as most firearms in the domains surrounding his were supplied by Lamordia. The Lamordians care little about his disregard, as they believe that the dictatorial madman will be defeated by firearms and discipline.",
								"Lamordia as a domain takes its creation from the depths of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein but also takes inspiration from The Island of Dr. Moreau by H.G. Wells. The themes of Lamordia are different to those domains around them, dealing with hubris, the usurpation of the power of gods, and the creation of twisted life. In many ways, it is the epitome of blasphemy - science taking the place of the gods and creating and changing life with the powers granted to those few with the intelli-gence to do so: Embodied mainly by Victor Morden-heim and Adam. Adventures in Lamordia should show these facts. The Lamordians that the heroes encounter see themselves as intellectually superior, dismissing petty notions of magic and gods. The heroes should face twisted mockeries of life (though importantly, not the undead) with mongrelfolk, flesh golems (but not other types of golems), and many abominations being the primary opponents here. Of course, any run-in with a flesh golem runs the risk of it being one of Adam's creations, or worse yet, Adam himself. The restoration of life should also be a major theme, but through sci-ence, not magic. And ultimately the consequences of failure when such attempts inevitably go wrong.",

The cold climate of Lamordia and its strong winds means that the fur is thicker than that on animals found elsewhere. All the common animals in colder climates can be found here, such as deer, elk, moose, and boar. The most common predator found in the domain is the wolverine, with the Lamordian variant being particularly fierce and aggressive, to the point where local hunters believe that they feed on something that drives them mad. Lamordia is mostly free of the dangers that infect so many other domains. The undead are unheard of here, as are goblins and lycanthropes. Instead, the forests teemed with un-natural life, dire animals, strange amalgamations of humans and animals, such as the mongrelfolk, and creatures with no set form, like gibbering mouthers and oozes."

The highlands feature many stands of coniferous trees such as pines, larches, and fir trees, while the lowlands feature oak, beech, and walnut. Almost ev-erywhere is covered in grass, apart from the colder highland tops, that nearly tip into mountain peaks. Many herbs are found in the lowlands as well, but across both the high and lowlands, the visitor to Lam-ordia will find an astonishing range of toxic and dan-gerous plants. Local herbalists often gather these and use them for medicine, but locals with fewer scruples often turn these into poisons and sell them outside the domain, especially in Borca and Dementlieu. Special mention must go to the blistercap mushroom, a small hardy mushroom found on the slopes of the Sleeping Beast mountain range. This black mushroom, when ground and mixed with the saliva of the coal toad (which is found on the edges of the dry heaths of the plains) turns it into a virulent poison that causes per-manent damage to the nervous system."

The western part of Lamordia is most-ly forested, with some plains and swamps scattered in between, but to the far north-east lies the Finger, a range of islands that the Lamordians surmise are infected with pirates and dangerous beasts. The Isle of Agony is especially avoided by the Lamordians as they believe that a powerful monster - one that takes human form, resides there and slays all unwelcome visitors."

A small group of monks make their home there, never leaving the area of the monastery. Ostensibly, they're attempting to contact their god, Lothurr, a god of storms and lightning - a fact that is often mocked by the Lamordians as being a hopeless quest rooted in superstition. Strangely, all the monks are large and powerfully built, the Lamordians putting that down to healthy living, hard work, and the fresh air of the mountains. Considering that the monks fo-cus on purification of the soul, and have learned many secrets of surgery through dissection and experimen-tation over the years, they could be right. Unknown to the Lamordians, the monks are not humans, though many appear as such. They are Adam's failed chil-dren - flesh golems that he attempted to create in his own image, but who did not live up to his expectations of power and intelligence. They lack souls, and they are looking for them here. Referring to themselves as the Seekers of the Spark, they seek to create their own god from pieces of religion elsewhere, in much the same manner as Adam created them. This is also what leads them to be unable to do anything but cow-er before him, should he attack - he cannot control them, but neither can they defeat him. Unknown to the Seekers (and anyone else) is the presence of Bal-toi, an amarilith tanar'ri that was trapped underneath the Sleeping Beast range (and after whom the range is named). She is of gigantic proportions, held back by strong spells that have caused her to fall into hi-bernation. She is the most powerful outsider currently trapped in the Mists and her bonds are beginning to weaken. Should she break loose, even Adam might have trouble keeping her in check."

								"Necropolis is ruled by Death. Or at least a creature that thinks of itself as the actual incarnation of the Grim Reaper (and resembles it in most ways, to the point that most Darkonians consider the two synonymous). His control over the undead of Necropolis is absolute, and he brooks no dissent. His control is not all-power-ful, only extending to those in his immediate presence, nor is he omniscient, limiting his ability to foresee what is happening. This has led to the rise of a minor cult of former priests who continue to worship their old gods, who plot to destroy Death and the other undead while restoring themselves to life. They hide beneath the sur-face waiting to strike. And they are not the only ones, as whenever Death's attention fades (which it does of-ten), the various factions of undead (often split along the same lines as the undead types) vie for supremacy and rule over the city. Only when Death's attention re-turns do they return to an uneasy peace once more.",
								"Entering Necropolis carries grave risks for the heroes, due to the Shroud. Any creature that enters it turns into one of the undead eventually, and then, leaving proves incredibly difficult. Only the use of amaranth (described in Fauna below) or various forms of life-preserving magic will prevent them from turning into monsters.",
								"Strangely, in spite of this extreme fixation on the undead, that is not the theme of the domain. Certainly, the idea of life after death is there, but just as much, it is the epitome of the sin of pride. Azalin's pride created Death. Azalin's pride was what caused him to vanish and Death to rise in his place. Death's pride was what caused Azalin to be able to return once more. And his continued pride is what prevents him from launching an effective attack on Azalin now, with any undead sent by Death into Darkon falling under the control of Azalin. On a smaller scale, pride is what is causing the civ-il war in Necropolis as well. The pride of the various kinds of undead. The pride of Death causes him to spend time delving into his memories and dreams of power and the Requiem itself and thus preventing him from uniting the undead beneath him.",
								"These two should be recurring themes whenever the heroes adventure in Necropolis. They should see a travesty of life wherever they go. Undead creatures go about their day in a horrible mockery of the way that life moves outside the domain. And they should see the pride that leads to the clashes that the undead engage in with each other, and they should see their own pride exposed whenever they think themselves smarter than the lesser undead. Pride is a deadly sin in Necropolis, and only by taking great care should it be possible to survive.",

In Darkonian tales, amaranth suppos-edly prevented aging and had life-sustaining qualities, but in Necropolis this tall tale became true. When fresh amaranth blossoms (less than three days old) are worn next to the skin, the wearer is unaffected by the Shroud and does not age. However, exposure to any sort of positive energy, such as the wearer being healed with spells, will instantly kill amaranth and remove the pro-tection offered to the wearer.

There seems to have been no real pattern to what form of undead a living creature became except for spellcasters - those with spellcasting abilities all retained these faculties in their undead forms with most arcane spellcasters be-coming liches (though some were quite weak for such a creature) and most divine casters becoming mummies with the more powerful becoming mummy lords. A few vampires appeared of both types as well. The only oth-er commonality between the undead transformations was that families tended to become the same type - i.e. one family of ghouls and another of skeletons, with the variations usually based around spellcasting ability (so a family of zombies might have a lich in the family who was previously a wizard). The other thing to note is that these undead are all intelligent, even the ones that would normally be considered mindless. Seeing skeletons talking to each other and conversing with zombies can be a disconcerting feeling, especially for undead hunters, once they realize that these normal-ly weak undead are using tactics against them, rather than being unthinking hordes."

The Temple of Eternal Pen-ance was the center of the worship of the Eternal Order in Il Aluk, and it was led by Brege Heuss and George d'Arcy. Unknown to George, Brege was a werewolf at the time, one who kept her predations very quiet, often disposing of her kills in the sewers below the city. Af-ter the Requiem, when both of them became undead (Brege turning into a wight, and George into a vampire) they came to an odd truce, that allowed them to share control of the Unholy Order - the main religion of the Necropolitans. This order is dedicated to the worship of Death, and functions as both priesthood and secret police in a similar manner to the Kargat for Azalin. The few who still subscribe to the worship of the Eternal Order consider them heretics and have started wor-shiping at the Temple of Undying Order in Degradia instead.

They fight viciously to keep their territory but show no interest in expand-ing it. What they're guarding no-one knows, but rumors abound of them rebuilding the Doomsday Device, of holding some magical secret to restoring life, to an undead abomination being trapped deep beneath the city, one that drives them all insane. No one knows the truth, and the halflings are not willing to talk to anyone."

Built from granite and bluestone, it has no windows at all and sits astride an entire city block. Carved with depictions of torture and twisted col-umns, it has a palpable aura of pain and horror. Even scrying on the building has made some creatures go insane. Scrying on the inside of the building has prov-en impossible, as it is warded with strong magic. This is perhaps to protect the rumored Black Vault - a repos-itory of all the cursed items that Azalin has collected for study during his reign. If so, Death has not been able to access the Black Vault, and should he succeed, it would spell disaster for everyone else."

												"Lowellyn Dachine was marked for greatness before he was born. Azalin, the lich lord of Dark-on, cannot learn new magic and the lich finds this curse almost too much to bear. Azalin sought to break his curse by using a wish to cause several women around Darkon to fall pregnant with his clones. Most of the clones died in the womb, but the few that survived, the lich watched. Azalin used magic to make sure that his clones studied the arcane arts and were fanatically loy-al to the lich lord. Once the clones had spent a few de-cades mastering magic, Azalin planned on draining the knowledge from their minds. If Azalin retained what the clones had learned, he would have found a way around the horrible curse the Dark Powers had placed on him. Although Azalin was able to drain several of his clones, the knowledge they had gained fled Azalin's mind as fast as he learned it. Azalin was determined to salvage something out of the experiment, and placed each of his clones into positions of power. Lowellyn Dachine was unusual for a high-ranking member of the Kargat. He was a human while most high ranking members were vampires, or rarely werewolves. Lowellyn was also a cleric in the Eternal Order, giving him powerful positions in the secret police and state religion of Dar-kon. Because of his powerful will and complete loyalty, Azalin chose Lowellyn to test the infernal machine, the prototype for the Doomsday Device. The Doomsday Device was Azalin's latest attempt to escape the Demi-plane of Dread. The infernal machine was designed to steal the life force of dozens and channel them into the creature inside the infernal machine. The machine worked perfectly, transforming Lowellyn from a human into something more. Lowellyn shed his human name and became Death. Death was a powerful elemental, composed entirely of negative energy. The experience shattered Lowellyn's sanity and he began to believe he was the embodiment of death itself. Azalin found the new creature fascinating and moved ahead with his plans for the Doomsday Device, which was the infernal machine on a grand scale. Death was chased from the Eternal Order's temple by adventurers soon after and fled into the mists. Death emerged from the mists in Il Aluk and began helping Azalin with the final preparations for Doomsday Device. When the device was activated, Azalin disappeared and Il Aluk became Death's domain. Il Aluk became Necropolis, the city of the dead. All of its inhabitants had been slain by the Doomsday Device and reanimated by the necrotic energy rampaging through the city. Death is the most powerful creature in Necropolis, and can control any of the undead within its borders, but cannot move beyond the Shroud that surrounds Necropolis. Death worked to stop the return of Azalin, unsure of what would hap-pen if the darklord returned. Death's agents were frus-trated when after five years Azalin returned."

								"To live in Tepest is to be mired in superstition as the residents of this (barely civilized) domain are convinced that they're under attack by the \"fey\" at ev-ery turn. Their belief that the \"fey\" are out to get them leaves them so deluded that they can no longer distin-guish between actual fey creatures, humanoids, and monsters. Anything that seems to be non-human has a good chance of being convicted as being fey. As has any creature with access to magic, whether this is from training (such as a wizard) or by nature (such as the spell-like abilities of various creatures). There is SOME truth to this idea, as before the emergence of Tepest, the inhabitants were under siege by the fey, but when they erupted into the misty realms of Ravenloft, these \"fey creatures\" seem to have disappeared into the background. With the rise of the Tepestani Inquisition, this is, even more, the truth, and they now operate in secret (but are no less prominent).",

Perhaps the heroes come here looking for riches, like the famous pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. Perhaps they've heard tales of a house made of food or of dwarven mines rich with gold. The greed that drives them here, should bring them into conflict with the fey realms and from there, they'll simply have to follow to see how deep the rabbit hole goes.",

										"Tepest is a domain covered in thick and ancient forests of hardwood, mainly beech, oak, and hazelnut. It is occasionally interrupted with pine or spruce, but there are none of the warm-weather trees present here. All the forests are gnarled and twisted, far beyond what they should be, even for their age. Even trees that are known to grow straight and true in other lands are twist-ed here, almost as if the land itself is trying to scare away the unwary, giving the domain the appearance of an evil fairytale forest. The trees are strong and healthy, with thick crowns that block out the sun, and in the eternal gloom underneath the boughs, numerous mushrooms and mosses can be found. In the forests are occasional, natural clearings that the locals refer to as \"fey rings\". Within these clearings, explosions of colors can be found, as they are covered in flowers and grasses, and some strange property of them caus-es spring and summer to linger here, longer than in the lands around them. The locals avoid the rings until they've been \"cleansed\" by a priest, as they believe that they're home to fey creatures, who lure in and trick mortals. Once the clearings have been cleansed, however, they're favorite spots of local herders. Three plants that are native to Tepest warrant mention: cloud-berries, fairy stools, and wichtingourds. Cloudberries grow only naturally in the bogs of the southern woods, and the southern shores of Lake Kronov. Attempts to cultivate them elsewhere have failed, except for a suc-cessful planting on the hillsides overlooking the Black-mist River. These cloudberries make for a potent and fruity wine that's won acclaim and fame in Nova Vaasa in the past 20 years and is quickly becoming a favorite of the nobles of that realm. Fairy stools resemble fly agarics, with red caps and white spots. They grow in lines, circles, or spirals, but a peculiar property of them is that they flourish wherever magic has been cast - sprouting like crazy within 2 hours of being exposed to magic, almost as if they draw some form of suste-nance from the magic. The locals believe that these mushrooms sprout only in the presence of fey, but use them as a form of primitive detect magic. Moved to a tray and passed across the body of an accused, they believe that if the mushroom sprouts more, it is a sign of fey witchcraft.",
										"Wichtingourds are also believed to only grow when exposed to fey influences, but instead of working like primitive detection devices, the Tepestani have re-alized that these have two peculiar properties. If the gourds are dried and turned into a rattle, they can be used to great effect for settling infants and the restless. If the dried wichtingourd is rattled, everyone within 5 feet must make a DC 8 Wisdom save. Failure means that the creature is exhausted (at level 1) for 2 (1d4) rounds. Anyone already exhausted must make another DC 8 Wisdom save or fall asleep. A new saving throw must be made each round that the gourd is rattled, though deaf creatures are immune.",
										"The second property affects only fey creatures and outsiders. If a dried ground is broken open, and the seeds spilled in a 10-foot line or 5-foot circle, they must make a DC 12 Wisdom save to avoid having to pick up and count all the seeds. Picking up and counting the seeds requires a DC 10 Acrobatics check, and takes 1d4 rounds. If the creature has failed the Wisdom sav-ing throw, it is incapable of crossing the line or circle, until the seeds have been picked up, forming a barrier similar to a wall of force that affects only the creature itself."

										"While Tepestani view all monsters as \"fey\" or controlled by them at least, that isn't entirely true. While there is a large amount of them present in the domain, such as nymphs and sprites, and more dangerous varieties, they aren't the only monsters around. Goblins and \"gob-lin beasts\" are far more prevalent than any fey, but that is not how the Tepestani view it. There are a number of treants here as well, all corrupted by the presence of the Mindefisk sisters, but their greatest achievement is Blackroot, a twisted undead treant that rules the Hag's Wood (Brujamonte) south of Viktal. These are all on top of the monsters that wander in from other domains, but there is one thing that the Tepestani are correct in: The fey are NOW a threat - their numbers have increased exponentially since the appearance of the Shadow Rift. Of far greater danger than the mon-sters or any fey in Tepest is the Tepestani Inquisition. Created by Wyan of Viktal, out of good intent to root out dangerous fey and those under their influence, it has grown and mutated beyond his control. The fur-ther away from Wyan and Viktal that the Inquisitors get, the more brazen they become, with some only giving lip-service to the ideals that they supposedly uphold. Many of the Tepestani themselves have come to see the Inquisition as a useful tool to remove obstacles, with many neighbors blaming even minor incidents on each other and accusing one another of consorting with fey. To the Tepestani Inquisition there are only 4 levels of guilt: Innocent, the accused is bewitched (bheict faoihk raiocht in Tepestani), the accused is a fey consort (fealltóir), or the accused is one of the fey themselves. Suffice to say, that very rarely is anyone found innocent, though those who are bewitched are generally treated as innocent by way of being manipu-lated, so their punishment is light. Those who consort or are one of the fey are often forced to confess via torture and then burned at the stake. As the Inquisition also works as the law enforcement in Tepest, running afoul of them is highly dangerous."

The first is the temple to Belenus, which is the only temple to the god in Tepest that does not have an open-air area. It is instead a much darker brooding structure than other temples and features pews of the worshipers to sit on (The open-air affairs that are nor-mal to Belenus do not have places for the lay-folk to sit). The other structure is the home of Wyan, the founder and leader of the Tepestani Inquisition. Both of these structures sit within the same compound, and on the outside, Wyan's house is ostentatious when compared to the four buildings in Tepest. Inside, it is clear that the man is humble, but values knowledge, having the only (small) library in Tepest within his house. Furthermore, the man has invented a written language for Tepestani (which doesn't feature writing of its own). But while the man is smart, he is also driven. The death of his second wife at the hands of the fey broke something in him, and he created the Inquisition and led hundreds of courts, which led to the death of many fey. His re-cord-keeping is immaculate and he was always thor-ough, but when his own daughter fell under the sway of the fey and nearly caused him to condemn an innocent to death, he withdrew to heal his daughter and search his records and feelings to see if he had been too vig-orous. Only in the last year or so has Wyan reemerged as the leader of the Inquisition, but he now spends most of his time curbing their worst excesses. This has many of the other influential Inquisitors worried as Wyan acquits far more people than any other mem-ber of the Inquisition, but his immaculate record-keep-ing (that he insists other Inquisitors follow) reveals that he still performs his work to the best of his ability."

										"The three hags of Tepest are sisters that live deep in the Wormwood. They can change their appearance at will, and alter their features on a whim. Laveeda pre-fers to have dark hair and long black nails. Leticia's hair and clothes flow around her like she is in a strong cur-rent, and wears elaborate necklaces. Lorinda is always well dressed in animal skins of questionable origin.",
										"Despite their outward appearance, the sisters see each other's true forms. They are twisted and hunched ogresses. They have razor sharp nails and thick teeth perfect for crunching bones.",
										"Laveeda is an annis hag. She is the strongest of the sisters and her nails and teeth are made of iron. Leticia is a sea hag. Her skin is a deep blue and she is cov-ered in small scales. Seaweed grows in her hair and she smells of rotting fish if she doesn't use magic to cover the odor. Lorinda has become a green hag. Her skin is green and rough like the bark of an ancient tree.",
										"The sisters have a cozy cottage in the middle of the Wormwood, and regularly entertain travellers and lost adventurers. Laveeda will cook them a splendid meal while Leticia and Lorinda distract their guests. The hags are talented potion makers and their guests are left awake but helpless after dinner is served. Once the hags have slain their victims no part of the body is left to waste. The skin and bones are eaten, the teeth and any organs not needed for an immediate potion are crafted into beautiful jewelry. The remaining organs are either used to craft potions or preserved for a snack later.",

												"Rudella Mindefisk desperately wanted daughters. She and her brutish husband, Holger, had several sons, but Rudella prayed for a daughter. In her desperation Rudella didn't think about who she was praying to.",
												"One morning the sound of a baby crying met Rudella when she awoke. She followed the cries to the door of her house and, much to her joy, found three baby girls left on her doorstep. Holger wanted to drown the infants in a nearby river. They were sickly and weak, but Rudella didn't care. They were her beautiful baby girls and Rudella would die before she let any harm come to them. Rudella named them Laveeda, Leticia, and Lorinda.",
												"Under Rudella's care the three girls regained their strength quickly. In a few years the girls grew strong, As the girls grew strong Rudella started to weaken. By the time the girls were three, Rudella was sickly. By the time the girls were five Rudella was too weak to leave her bed. Right after the girls turned six, Rudella died.",
												"Holger wasted no time grieving for his wife. Instead, he considered taking the girls into the forest and leav-ing them to die of exposure, but decided to keep them around as long as they would keep the house clean and cook for him and his sons. For years Holger and his sons would ignore the sisters until they wanted to be fed or have something cleaned.",
												"The girls grew into intelligent and talented teenagers. Laveeda was a brilliant cook, with the exception of mutton, which she always burnt or under cooked. Laveeda could take almost any ingredient and make wonderful meals. She got a job at a local inn and her cooking brought in travellers for miles around. Laveeda was happy at first, but her father demanded her wages. Holger forced Laveeda to work sick, and never let her rest. Laveeda soon quit the tavern.",
												"Leticia fashioned beautiful jewelry, often out of worthless stones and polished animal bones. On the rare occasion Leticia had actual gems, she could craft as-tounding works of art. Leticia even attracted the atten-tion of a few local nobles, who paid a hefty sum for Leticia's art. Holger took the gold and drank it away. Leticia soon stopped making jewelry.",
												"Lorinda was a seamstress beyond comparison. Lorinda had a natural talent for stitchery and how fabric fell around a body. Lorinda could work with any materi-al, animal skins, wool, even silk when she could find some. The local villagers even became suspicious of Holger and his sons. How could a poor farmer afford such elegant clothing? Lorinda refused any commissions, no matter the cost. She had seen the greedy look in her father's eyes as he took her sister's money. Lorinda would be damned before she would become a slave for her father.",
												"The three sisters were desperate to leave their abusive father, but knew they needed gold to survive. They saw their chance when a wealthy stranger stopped at their farmhouse. The stranger had gold and was will-ing to pay gold for any food the sisters could spare. A silent agreement was reached in an instant. Leticia and Lorinda entertained the traveller while Laveeda cooked a wonderful meal. Laveeda could mask any flavor and the stranger never tasted the poison that killed him. The sisters took care of the body quickly. Laveeda cooked the meat into stew for Holger and her brothers. Leticia polished his bones and turned them into jewelry. Lorinda tanned the skin into wonderful new vests for her father and brothers. The sisters had found a way to get the gold they needed, while taking a small amount of revenge on Holger and their broth-ers. They continued to murder innocent strangers for years, amassing a vast fortune buried in the woods. One day an absolutely beautiful man appeared at the gates to the farmhouse. He was witty, intelligent, and told the sisters exactly what they wanted to hear. The three sisters fought for the man's affections, shower-ing him with gold and gifts. The man spent the money on a lavish lifestyle, and disappeared as soon as the money was gone. The sisters realized they had been played and were furious. They tracked him down and took their time cutting him to ribbons. The sisters were broke and hungry. They had no food and no way to get any, so they turned to the only meat they had on hand. As they devoured the dandy, the Mists clouded in. When the Mists cleared, the sisters had changed. They were hags now and revelled in their new power and abilities."

								"The tale of Blaustein and Bluebeard is inspired by the mythological French story of Bluebeard, the Maiden-killer. But where the Bluebeard of myth was killed by the brothers of his final wife, the Bluebeard of Blaustein got away with his crimes, having killed at least eight women before entering the Mists of Raven-loft, and at least two thereafter. In some ways, the tales of Bluebeard within the context of Ravenloft also feel like a retelling of the story of King Henry VIII and the killing of his wives. There is, of course, the recurring theme of violence against women in this domain, and it is a horrific subject - it should be presented as such. There is NOTHING that can redeem Bluebeard's ac-tions in the eyes of outsiders, but the second theme is where it gets complicated. It is a theme of unending loyalty and trust. Not a matter of earning or having re-ceived such trust in accordance with one's actions, but having gained it either through subterfuge or power. Adventures in Blaustein need to be carefully planned out, as not every group will be comfortable with the first of the two themes in this domain. Any group that de-cides to touch on this should check with all the players and even the Dungeon Master whether they are com-fortable with such a subject or not. If they are not, it should be avoided as it is one that comes dangerously close to real-life experiences. Adventures that choose to focus on the second theme should involve trust, the breaking thereof, and the deadly consequences that one might face if one does not obey (instantly) the lord of Blaustein.",

												"Before he was brought into the Demiplane of Dread, Bluebeard would have considered his current physical appearance to be a gift from the gods. Bluebeard was, to say in no uncertain terms, hideous. His skin was red and blotchy, his lips were swollen and a disturbing shade of purple. If Bluebeard didn't con-centrate, his tongue would protrude from his mouth. His beard was cobalt blue and hung in thick braids to his chest. He looked for all the world like a corpse. De-spite this, Bluebeard was very popular with the women of his small kingdom, Blaustein. Undeniably charming, Bluebeard always had a humorous story or ribald joke at the ready. It didn't hurt that he was fabulously wealthy, owning gold and silver mines that he used to fund successful trading ventures all over the world. His castle was large and well appointed, with rarities such as mirrors and gear driven clocks in every room. Bluebeard was often away on business ventures that took him far from Castle Bluebeard and Blaustein, but he would return as soon as possible. The people of Blaustein considered Bluebeard a just lord, but whispered about his great tragedy. They didn't whisper about his looks, which you grew accustomed to after a while, but his wives. By the time Bluebeard was in his early twenties he had been married three times. Each time he had only been married for a few months be-fore his wife met a tragic end. The people of Blaustein whispered that Castle Bluebeard was haunted, that the spirit of either Bluebeard's first wife, or his long dead mother, haunted the castle and killed the wives when they were alone. Others thought the castle itself was evil and devoured the young women. The truth was far darker. Bluebeard's fourth wife was Marcella, a beau-tiful and cunning young woman. Marcella was as witty as her new husband, and helped him make several shrewd business decisions soon after they were mar-ried. She also learned some important facts about her husband. Bluebeard treated his opinions like facts and hated it when someone disagreed with him. Even rea-soned and well thought arguments that he disagreed with would be met with disdain and a refusal to accept that he could be wrong. Marcella soon learned her life with Bluebeard would be much happier if she agreed with her husband, no matter what she actually thought. It didn't hurt that Bluebeard showered his new bride with gifts when she agreed with him.",
												"A month after their wedding, Bluebeard left to attend to business affairs in a neighboring kingdom. Before he left, Bluebeard gave his wife a large ring of keys. He told her that the keys would open every room in the castle, and she was free to explore as long as she followed one rule. Bluebeard held up a small golden key and told Marcella that it unlocked the room at the top of the tallest tower in the castle. Marcella was not to enter that room under any circumstances. To do so would invite disaster for her and their marriage. She agreed and Bluebeard left the next day. For a month she explored the castle, and the room at the top of the tower was never far from her mind. Twice she placed the key in the lock but lost her nerve at the last second.

When her eyes ad-justed to the darkness, Marcella shrieked in horror. Bluebeard's three past wives were in the small room. They had been hung from hooks and their throats had been slit. The cuts were so deep that the spine of one of the wives had been gouged and nicked by the blade.",
												"Marcella slammed the door and ran screaming back to her chambers. Once she returned to her room she realized, much to her renewed horror, that the lit-tle golden key had turned blood red. Marcella stared at the key, realizing it spelled her doom, when she heard her husband's voice behind her demanding to know what she had done. Bluebeard dragged his wife through the castle, bemoaning his fate. Marcella had been his favorite, but now she couldn't be trusted. He hauled her up the stairs and they disappeared into the room. No one knows how many wives Bluebeard had before he was claimed by the mists, although Blue-beard himself thinks he may now be on his eighth wife."

Her name, Althea is derived easily from Athena (and is evidenced by her ranged attacks), she is a medusa (like the famous Me-dusa of the Gorgon sisters, the one killed by Perseus), and her prison is inspired by the maze that kept the minotaur of Minos away from prying eyes.",
								"Her island of Demise is equally embedded in myth. The name of it suggests that Althea is the Medusa of Greek legend, the one who died at the hands of Perseus, but was sent here to suffer. Perhaps she is a slightly different version, one who became monstrous not by accident (unlike our Medusa who was cursed by a goddess), but by her own actions.",
								"Perhaps she killed the men who came to see her, ever-seeking a perfect but non-existent, mate. The island itself, and its build-up bring those parables to mind as well. A barren island to those who pass it by (like the Cyclopean Islands of the Odyssey), even the lush caldera at the center of the volcano can be lik-ened to the eye of the Cyclops - alive, but alone.",
								"Adventures on Demise should focus on Althea and her search for a mate, but maedar (male medusae) are incredibly rare, and she'll try to lure others into her embrace. Her greatest hope is that one day she'll find a mate, someone to spend her time with, though of course, with her deadly gaze, such an idea is folly. Adventurers who come to Demise should come here of their own volition, as Althea will not set traps to lure them here - she believes her mate will come willingly.",

Soon, one by one, the men were disappearing. After a few hours only Weh-ner was left. He tied a blindfold around his eyes and tried to meet his fate bravely. To his shock the crea-ture didn't charge him, but instead approached him slowly, entreating him to stay, to enjoy her wealth and companionship. Her voice was lovely, but offset by the sibilant hissing of serpents. Wehner lashed out and felt his blade connect. The creature screamed and ripped off Wehner's blindfold. Something spat venom in his eyes, burning them in the sockets. Weh-ner turned and ran. He miraculously made his way out of the maze and back to his ship.

								"Dominia lies within the Sea of Sorrows and is the personal domain of Dr. Dominia, also known as Da-claud Heinfroth. Dominia is the domain of mental an-guish as the doctor performs experiments and torture on subjects at the Asylum for the Mentally Disrupted (known to some as Heinfroth's Home for the Mentally Ill).",
								"Dominia is a small island, some five miles long and wide, but worryingly it is a domain that is expand-ing. The darklord briefly held control over Gund-arak before the Grand Conjunction, but his inter-ests did not include running a domain, and he was a poor ruler. His interests lie in the many afflictions that can affect the human mind as he tries to save himself from the madness that runs in his family.",
								"When the island originally appeared, it was no more than a mile across, barely able to contain the com-pound of the Asylum, and it was adrift in the mists. As Daclaud delved deeper and deeper into his atrocious experiments, inflicting greater and greater anguish on his subjects, the domain grew, and eventually joined the Sea of Sorrows as an island. With each step as it grew, he gained more power and more control. Some-thing else strange happened, as Daclaud disappeared in 740 BC, creating his small domain in the mists, but he remembers spending several years here. How-ever, everyone else knows that the island-domain in the Sea of Sorrows appeared that same year.",
								"Given time, if he is allowed to continue his experiments, the island may grow to rival the size of the domains of the Core, but what then will happen? ",
								"There are two overriding themes in Dominia - mental suffering and total control. The doctor conducts his gruesome work and has learned more about men-tal illness than anyone else in Ravenloft and his fa-cility is the most advanced in these areas, with the possible exception of Dr. Illhousen and Dr. Tasker at the Clinic for the Mentally Distressed. When that facility vanished from Nova Vaasa, Dr. Heinfroth be-came the \"destination of choice\" for the suffering. Anyone who comes here has a mental illness or issue that they're dealing with - and if they don't, the Dr. conducts experiments on them until they do.",
								"The second overriding theme is one of control and oversight. Everyone here, whether orderly or pa-tient, dresses the same, in neutral gray-colored robes, and wearing smiling, white, clay masks. This is all to cause a loss of individual identity and arouse suspicion so that you never know when you're safe. The masks especially reinforce this, as the smiling masks look friendly, to begin with, but the longer one looks on them, the more mocking they become.",
								"Adventures in Dominia should naturally revolve around these: Perhaps one of the heroes has suffered great trauma and magic has proven unhelpful, and the heroes bring their friend here in the hopes of a cure. Or perhaps they come here looking for a patient that was sent here, but which no one has heard from. Finding someone who has lost their identity amid a sea of gray robes and clay masks should prove dif-ficult. They should also always feel that they're be-ing watched. Daclaud is ALWAYS watching, whether through the prying eyes of his orderlies or through magic.",

After a month she could not speak more than two words at a time and had trouble remembering basic concepts. By six months she had to be bound to keep herself and others safe. She died screaming in fear and rage a few days later. In six months the dis-ease had torn her mind apart, then taken her life.",
												"After her funeral, Heinfroth began to research his ancestry. He found that every single one of his relatives on his mother's side had died of the same disease, most before the age of thirty. The disease always worked the same way, their minds were rapidly torn apart by a mysterious disease, then death.",
												"Heinfroth was determined that he would not suffer the same fate. He began to kidnap anyone that wouldn't be missed and experiment on them. He would break the mind of his victims through torture and manipulation, then try to heal them of the afflictions he caused.",
												"Within a few years Heinfroth was no closer to curing the madness that had taken his mother, but was a master at psychologically damaging innocent people. What's more he found he enjoyed tearing apart the minds of his victims, and had a natural affinity for it. His half hearted attempts at curing the madness he caused were no match for the zeal he had in inflicting it on his victims.",
												"After a few years of torturing vagabonds and transients, Heinfroth finally had a breakthrough. He used long syringes to take spinal fluid out of healthy victims and injected it directly into the spine and skulls of suf-fering patients. To his surprise, the patients showed some improvement.",
												"Using his new techniques, Heinfroth was accepted to study at the Asylum for the Mentally Disturbed. The asylum provided the perfect cover for Heinfroth's work. Hienfroth began to refine his technique and soon was a master at draining every last drop of spinal fluid. It killed his victims, but sacrifices in the name of science were acceptable losses for him.",
												"By the time he was twenty eight, Heinfroth was recognized as the premier medical doctor in all of Gundarak. It was just after that birthday that Heinfroth noticed the tremors for the first time. His hands began to shake, ever so slightly. Then he began to forget things. Small things at first, but soon he was forgetting the names of people and places he had known all his life. The mad-ness had him in its grasp and it was only a matter of time before he fully succumbed.",
												"Heinfroth found a woman near his home in the prime of health and quickly spirited her away. He bound her and drained every last ounce of spinal fluid from her, then injected it directly into his brain. Unfortunately for Heinfroth, Duke Gundar, a powerful vampire and lord of Gundarak had chosen the woman to be his next vampire bride. Her spinal fluid, steeped in the life drain-ing energies that were the result of a feeding vampire, mixed with his to create a new and powerful undead. The cerebral vampire is a type of undead that must drain its victims of spinal fluid rather than blood. Their fangs are longer and stronger than a traditional vampire, perfectly formed to slip in between vertebrae or puncture the skull.",
												"Duke Gundar was furious with Heinfroth and nearly killed him. The only thing that saved his life was his total obedience to Duke Gundar and his weakness versus the Duke's mind dominating gaze. Gundar forced the doctor to move into his castle and serve as his full time physician.",
												"After years of dominating Heinfroth, Gundar conceived a plan to make the doctor the lord of neighboring Kar-takass, the domain of Harkon Lukas. Gundar tried to manipulate a party of adventurers into killing Harkon, but the wolfwere proved too canny a foe. The adven-turers uncovered the plot and returned to Gundarak, seeking revenge. Duke Gundar sought to lure them into a trap by using himself as bait. Gundar thought of his control over Heinfroth to ensure he would release the duke from his cage and Gundar could slaughter the fools at will.",
												"Much to the dismay of Gundar, Heinfroth was finally able to resist the mental domination of Duke Gundar. The adventurers wasted little time in staking the duke and fleeing the domain.",
												"With the death of Duke Gundar, Heinfroth assumed control of the domain. He moved back to the asylum to continue his research and ignored the rest of Gundarak. When the Grand Conjunction shattered Ravenloft, Gundarak was dissolved and the asylum became its own domain in the Core.",
												"Originally Dominia was small, just the asylum and its grounds, but as Heinfroth began to give into his sadism and cruelly experimenting on his victims, Dominia has slowly expanded."

He is willing to try any experiment, no matter how cruel on one of his patients or another cerebral vampire that he believes has the slightest chance of curing or preventing the lunacy. Un-fortunately, most of his victims are not suffering from madness, so Heinfroth has no way of knowing whether the experiment worked or not.",

Trotting out these poor victims has con-vinced the people of Dominia that Heinfroth is a living saint, living his life to bring succor to the mentally ill.

								"Eventually, as his corruption became more and more popular, the king took a dislike to him, and saw him as being less and less useful and more of a dan-ger to his own influence, and had a painting created that magically took away that which Stezen cared for the most: his feelings and sensations. Stezen became a man of grays, a man who took no joy in anything and received no pleasure from any sensa-tion. In frustration, he murdered the king and found himself exiled to the Mists. But it was not enough.",
								"The Dark Powers cursed the man so that the painting could never be destroyed, but he can receive some amount of pleasure by exposing people to his picture. For the few hours that the murders he com-mits, using the painting, give him any sensation, he reverts to his old ways of indulgence, lust, and worse.",
								"Ghastria reflects this as well - nothing conveys any feeling or emotion. There is no taste to the food, and the people there, while they love Stezen as a ruler, have no other emotion for him, and he has had to curb his killings to avoid attention. Only when his passions are up do they sense anything. Unfortunately for visi-tors to the island, they are usually the ones that arouse his passions, and the ones he can get away with mur-dering. This is also what should drive any adventures in Ghastria. Stezen is virtually immortal, but he is prac-tically addicted to the short fixes of emotions that he gets. He wants people to see his portrait so that he can leech what little joy he can, not to see them die to any-thing else, even his own hand. Adventures in Ghastria should revolve around the rising passions and emo-tions and the strange lack of them that the inhabitants have. Perhaps an artist friend of the heroes has come here to paint the landscape, or perhaps someone they care about went missing on the island, whether to Stezen or one of the carrion eaters on the island.",

There are plenty of wildflowers around the island, dotted among the small deciduous forests (consisting mostly of beech and elm trees), but they're nothing that you couldn't find in many of the domains of the core. The one plant that truly stands out is umbral weed. Umbral weed, when boiled, creates a paste called umbral gray that is highly valued among artists for its smokey gray color - perfect for many moody paintings depicting dark clouds and storms. When this paste is mixed in a manner known to only a few people on Ghastria, it becomes a very powerful poison, but one that stinks to the high heavens and which tastes even worse. As the only one, the marquis has discovered when um-bral gray poison is mixed with the venom from carrion crawlers it becomes completely odor- and taste-less, making for it almost impossible to detect without the use of magic."

Stezen has several magnificent bedrooms and a chef beyond compare at his disposal, but one room is the jewel of his eye. Only a select few are ever invited to see his art gallery, wherein hang many pieces of great fame and renown. The famous balls that Stezen holds are infrequent, but he always hosts at least one every season - sometimes when he is in a good mood, and others while he is in a foul mood. Locals have learned to avoid his wrath when he is having one of his moodier periods. At the back of the house is one of its greatest secrets though, a secret chute where Stezen can send the bodies of his victims into an un-derground burrow of carrion crawlers (and the occa-sional ghoul), and eliminate any evidence that they were murdered by him."

												"Centuries ago, Marquis Stezen d'Polarno was a vassal to the powerful King Oderic IX on a for-gotten world far from the Demiplane of Dread. Stezen's father was a drunk who had squandered most of the family fortune on drink and disreputable company, but the young marquis was determined to erase this stain from his family's honor. Stezen's lust for life and mag-netic personality made him tremendously popular with the commoners in Oderic's realm and his quick wit and deadly rapier made him popular with the courtesans of Oderic's court as well. Oderic had been king for a long time, and knew an ambitious noble with designs on his throne when he saw one. It was only a matter of time before the old king and the young noble would decide the fate of the kingdom.",
												"During a particularly harsh winter, Stezen thought he saw his chance. One of his spies in the king's inner circle told the marquis about Oderic's huge grain stores held under the capital city. Even better, the spy had procured a map. The common people were starving in their homes and rebellion hung heavy in the air.",
												"Stezen laid his plans carefully. He gathered his allies in the capital and then leaked the map to the common-ers of the capital. The city was rocked by riots, urged on by Stezen and his followers. Stezen had several prominent nobles dragged into the streets to be torn to pieces by the howling crowd. Commoners and mer-chants that had slighted the vain marquis were given to the howling mob's tender mercies as well. Stezen rode a wave of blood to the very gates of Oderic's palace. Then it all went wrong.",
												"Oderic had secretly brought an army into the capital. Hundreds of loyal knights, thousands of pikemen and archers flooded the streets. The commoners fled for their lives, leaving Stezen and his noble followers to their fate. The son of the nobles Stezen had fed to the vicious crowd joined the fray searching for the treach-erous marquis.",
												"In a matter of hours it was all over. Oderic had Stezen's noble followers beheaded and their heads mounted on pikes. Grain was taken from the massive underground store houses and distributed to the people to quiet their stomachs. Unfortunately for Oderic, Stezen presented a problem. His grip on the common man was far too tight to make beheading safe, so Stezen was left to rot in the dungeons beneath Oderic's castle.",
												"Eventually one of Oderic's mistresses, a powerful spellcaster, came upon a solution. She painted a beau-tiful portrait of Stezen, and cast a complicated variant of the trap the soul spell. The spell only trapped part of Stezen's soul in the painting, leaving the marquis a bitter shell of what he was. Stezen's temper became short and his mood was foul. There was an undeniable wrongness about him and even the rats of the dungeon fled his presence. When Oderic saw what was left of his rival, he gleefully released him.",
												"Stezen became a sullen drunk, his lack of a soul and bitter demeanor made him an outcast. Stezen was ig-nored and forgotten. Only Oderic was ever happy to see the broken nobleman, and let the marquis have room in his castle. The king's overconfidence would prove his undoing.",
												"After a year of living as a bitter wretch, Stezen seized upon a desperate plan. Stezen waited until the feast that marked his defeat a year before. To show his pen-ance Stezen served the king himself. Oderic gleefully allowed the disgraced marquis to serve him. After the first bite, Oderic's throat closed and his face turned a disgusting purple. Stezen leaned forward and drank in Oderic's final moments with glee. As the guards reached for Stezen, a thick mist covered the castle. When it cleared, Stezen was gone.",

The por-trait that Oderic's mistress had painted of him hung in the middle of the grand ballroom. The servant girl stopped to look at the painting just as Stezen wished he could drain her soul to replace his own.",

								"Markovia is a land where man meets beast in the most literal way possible. There are no men, nor even humanoids here. Instead, there are animals, half-transformed into humanoids, the legendary Beast-Men, who make their living here. The island wasn't even always an island, as it used to lie in the Core, but when the Grand Conjunction happened, it was ripped from its place and thrust into the Sea of Sorrows. The island's master and the darklord of the domain is Dr. Frantisek Markov, named so only by himself. He has no formal education, instead once being a Barovian butcher, but one who fled into the mists when it was discovered that he had experimented on animals, per-forming gruesome surgeries on them, and one day had turned his skills upon his wife when she discov-ered his experiments. Everyone on the island is one of two things: One of the Beast-Men or one of Markov's victims-to-be. The doctor has performed many experi-ments and surgeries on the only readily available sub-jects on the island: the animals. And he has achieved a level of success with this that can only be rivaled by the performance of Victor Mordenheim in Lamordia. The doctor is capable of turning animals into thinking beings without the use of magic. Unfortunately, this requires extensive surgery, vivisection, transplants, and even brain surgery to a horrific level, using vari-ous surgical and alchemical techniques, and it leaves most of the subjects in constant pain.",
								"Apart from the pain is the fact that none of them remember their past lives - both those that were animals and those that were once humanoids have their minds erased as part of the surgery. Markov also has high expectations of his subjects, and so far only three have been deemed successes in his eyes, though a fourth one escaped him \u2014 likely his greatest success to date. One day he hopes that the surgery is perfected enough that he can attempt it on himself, and retain his memories at the same time. Adventures in Markovia should focus on the things that Markov has dodged: responsibility, human identity, and the fact that humans should not try to interfere too much with nature. Any heroes who run into the darklord should be in danger of being ex-perimented on by a man or creature completely devoid of emotion or compassion, where they should find that the subjects \u2014 the Beast-Men \u2014who appear horrific are the compassionate and human ones who lend a hand. But they should also find that the more \"success-ful\" these creatures are in the eyes of the doctor, the more horrific their actions should be \u2014 as evidenced especially by his three assistants (Orson, a brown bear Beast-Man, Felix, a leopard Beast-Man, and Delphi, a dolphin Beast-Woman) and Akanga (described below in Akanga's village)...",

It sits on a low hill and is surrounded by a well-tended grassy field filled with flower and vegetable gardens - often tended to by the beautiful Delphi. While rough-hewn, the manor is well built from spruce, fire, and the like and is so tightly jointed that even a tropical storm and high winds can-not penetrate the walls, even with the roof being made from thatch.",

The House has four inhabitants, Dr. Frantisek Markov himself rules the house with a firm hand, per-forming his surgery in the laboratory whenever he can. Orson is his most trusted Beast-Man, created from a brown bear. Orson is slow, methodical, and loyal to a fault, but is not the smartest creature around, the only thing that Markov regrets about him. Orson spends most of his day tending to the grounds and during the night he retreats to a smaller building near the manor.",

Felix makes all the appearance of being a loyal servant, but sharp observers will note that he sometimes sneaks off to Akanga's village to report the goings-on at the House. Delphi is the final inhabitant and was created when a wounded dolphin washed ashore on Markovia. She's the youngest of the house's inhabitants and incredibly beautiful, but young and un-aware of how the world works. She sees the doctor. as her father, and while not accepting of his behavior, she is too cowed to do anything about it and simply sees it as \"his nature\". She is very curious and will try to observe any newcomers to the island, but when not distracted in this manner, she'll spend her time tending to the house and the gardens."

The order hides a terrible secret though. One of the items that they keep safe is the Tablet of Life.

This is not readily apparent to any unwanted visitors (the monks do not generally let anyone in), but Dr. Mar-kov has realized that there is something different about these monks, though he's not sure what.

												"The remaining Markovs fled the village of Barovia and settled in and around the village of Vallaki. It was on a small pig farm outside Vallaki that Frantisek Markov was born. Frantisek was an intelligent child, quick to outpace the tutors his family could afford, especially in the sciences of biology and chemistry. Despite his quick and eager mind, Frantisek seemed doomed to the life of a pig farmer.",
												"Perhaps because of his interest in biology or because Frantisek seemed to have a certain way with knives, his family allowed him to butcher the hogs that were ready to go to market. Butchering the hogs gave the young boy a chance to study anatomy in a far more real way than studying books, and Frantisek began to indulge his curiosity. At first he would choose one pig from a herd and see how long it could last before the pain of being butchered killed it. He perfected a variety of alchemical concoctions that would paralyze the poor animal while he sliced it open. Frantisek made sure his custom elixirs wouldn't dull the animal's pain, lest some secret of its anatomy escape his notice. Soon he was vivisecting two and three hogs at the same time while happily and efficiently butchering the rest of the herd for sale. Once Frantisek had learned all he could of hogs, he began to seek new prey.",
												"At first, it was small animals around his farm, birds, cats, dogs, and rats. Then Frantisek would go into the woods and set traps for the animals that lived there. Soon he was experimenting on wolves, squirrels and even the occasional bear. As Frantisek grew older, strangers that visited his village sometimes disap-peared. Their clothes and money would be found in the woods around Vallaki. The villagers assumed the fools had tried to save some coin by spending the night in the woods around the village and paid for it with their lives. The truth was far worse. Frantisek started his greatest experiments, grafting parts from one creature to another. The surgery proved fatal for both creatures, but Frantisek never worried. The ones that lived were abandoned to the forest, and the ones that didn't were given to the pigs.",

												"Frantisek took money he had saved from butchering animals for the local farmers and the occasional trust-ing stranger and opened a butcher shop in the village. At first things went well. Frantisek and Ludmilla made a decent living carving animals and always had some-thing to eat, and when the butcher shop closed Fran-tisek retreated to his labs to continue his experiments. At first Ludmilla was glad to be away from her distant and intimidating husband, but soon became curious about his experiments.",
												"One night Frantisek, usually so careful, left the door to his laboratory unlocked. His wife, overcome with curi-osity, opened the door and screamed at what she saw inside. Dead animals, twitching halves of beasts and unholy combinations of animals no god ever dreamed of stared at her with pleading eyes. They were silently begging her for release from a life of pain. She only stopped screaming when she saw her husband, star-ing at her, eyes wild with rage. Lady Markov berated her husband and threatened to tell the village of Fran-tisek's sick secrets. Frantisek grabbed his wife and drug her into his lab, slamming the door shut. She lived for three days. When Ludmilla could no longer serve his curiosity, Markov dumped her body in the forest as he had with so many other victims, but it proved to be a nearly fatal mistake. At first hunters thought they had found a horribly mangled beast, but when they moved closer they saw the once familiar face on the butchered corpse. Ludmilla was pretty and popular, and when her corpse was found, the village wanted answers. They came to the butcher shop at night and broke down the door. Frantisek was found in his lab and the dozens of missing travelers, hun-dreds of dead mutilated animals, and unnumbered vile experiments suddenly had a cause. The mob dragged Frantisek into the village square and began pelting him with stones. Markov, desperate to escape, charged through the mob and dashed headlong into the mists. When the mists finally cleared, he had been given his domain, Markovia."

AS such, it is a dangerous domain, but made more so by the presence of the mists that obscure everything. This means that routes can differ for different ships. Two ships that set out on the same heading do not always arrive at the same location, nor is the location always the same later on. This is not helped by the inability of those travelling on the seas to distinguish between the Sea of Sorrow itself and the surrounding mists. As such they often end up in entirely different loca-tions that have no physical connection with the Sea of Sorrows.",

Any sailor that questioned the captain or his methods would soon find themselves bound hand and foot and thrown to the sharks that followed the {@i Relentless}.",
												"Riese was a wealthy man, but money meant nothing to him. His sole cares were his ship and his reputa-tionfor doing the impossible. It was this reputation that would spell Riese's doom.",
												"In a forgotten port in the Far East of Gothic Earth, whilst unloading cargo, Riese first heard of the leg-endary Northwest Passage. The means to travel from Europe to Asia by traveling through the icy waters north of the American continent, a ship that could find that passage could transport cargo from Europe to Asia in less than half the time of other ships, and gain fame and untold wealth.",
												"Riese attempted to find the Northwest Passage twice, but crushing icebergs and violent blizzards made him turn back each time. For Riese, this was completely unacceptable. Riese had sailed his ship through hur-ricanes, pirates, and doldrums, only to be defeated by ice. He began to obsess about finding the passage. When he sailed to find the passage a third time, Riese would not be defeated.",
												"As ice and snow closed in around the {@i Relentless}, Riese ordered the ship onward. The crew grew ner-vous as the ice closed in, and lost their nerve when the {@i Relentless} was battered by high seas, icebergs the size of mountains threatening to smash the ship to tinder. A blizzard was closing in, and already the air was freezing, as the snow fell heavily. The crew appointed a spokesman to take their concerns to the captain. They wished to abandon the {@i Relentless}, and man lifeboats back to safety and civilization.",
												"Riese was far past simple enragement. He strangled the spokesman with his bare hands, and told the crew that they would either find the passage or die trying. The crew, defeated, returned to their positions and prayed to whatever gods they held dear. The blizzard grew stronger and stronger, the air seemed to freeze and snow fell so thick it was a white sheet that ob-scured everything.",
												"Riese, realizing he and his ship were doomed, called out to any being that would listen, offering up the lives of his men if any entity would allow himself and the {@i Relentless} to make the passage. Something dark reached out from the edges of sanity, accept-ing Riese's offer. The crew was torn from the ship, and the {@i Relentless} and her captain lost their physical forms and became apparitions sailing through a mist bound sea. When the mist cleared Riese found him-self in a new sea."

They are perpetually stuck here, a constant reminder to the doctor of his failure. Under-neath the manor lies true horror, as it is here, in the basement, that the doctor conducts his experiments. A large operating theater is where he conducts his gruesome experiments, never using anesthetic or any other form of sedation on his victims as he carves out their eyes and removes their limbs.

Ramsay was a brilliant researcher who was relentless in his search for the truth, and that was why he had to flee. Ramsay cared little for such mundane things as curing a disease or replacing a defective organ without killing the patient. Such things were child's play for the doctor. What Ramsay wanted to discover was the nature and limits of pain.",
												"How much pain could someone take? A man? A wom-an? A child? What would happen if he removed an organ without anesthesia? What would happen if he removed the pain centers of the brain? What would happen if he stimulated the pain centers beyond what a mortal could possibly endure? Ramsay had to know the answers to these questions.",
												"Understandably, Blake had trouble finding volunteers to help him with his research. He began to take them from the undesirables of Mordentshire. At first he took in beggars and homeless, but soon he wanted differ-ent patients. Undesirables were sickly and poorly fed. Their ability to withstand pain was limited compared to a healthy patient, so Ramsay began to find his sub-jects from the wealthy. Soon the children of the elite began to disappear, only to reappear two weeks later with their organs removed, their scalps pulled back and their brains pierced with silver needles. The lucky ones were found dead.",

They had seen his face, as had his hapless \"volunteer\". Des-perate, Ramsay slit the throat of the man and fled into the darkness. He and his family left Mordentshire less than twelve hours later.",

Blake was fond of his daughter, who had a brilliant mind, but he wondered if he could produce an heir that was better able to continue his research. Ramsay's wife soon fell pregnant and their second child, Gregory, was born. Gregory's body was covered in weeping sores and his body was sickly and twisted. After a few years, Blake's wife gave birth to a second son, Blake Jr. The child was cold and distant, but never devel-oped his father's brilliance. Blake soon dismissed his son as a dullard and concentrated all his efforts on his daughter. The doctor made his daughter study endlessly, with very few breaks to sleep, eat, or play. It was during one of these breaks that as she took the airs, Ramsay watched her slip from the cliffs that surrounded the island. Blake sprinted down the three hundred foot cliff face, to find the broken body of his daughter.",
												"Ramsay brought her body back to his laboratory and started working. He would not be robbed of his only chance at immortality by something so trivial as death. For two weeks Blake labored to fix his daughter, re-fusing food and sleep. The accident had driven Blake mad, and in his madness he found strength.",
												"After two weeks of failure Ramsay heard a voice in the back of his mind telling him to use his wife and sons to fix his daughter. Ramsay raced to his home and slaughtered his family. He brought the corpses back to his lab and carefully repaired his daughter. At midnight her eyes snapped open and she asked what had transpired.Although his daughter seemed like she was alive, Blake was horrified to discover that her eyes, once a deep blue, were now an almost venom-ous green.

As night fell Renthon was visited by the Prince of Twilight. The Prince talked to Renthon, telling him how every mortal had been cheated and damaged years ago. Mortals used to possess two souls.

Adventurers might be sent here to rescue someone, or even to ask the Lady for ways to revert magical transformation. Nonetheless, a great risk lurks in such a journey. Adventurers will face great dangers and will have to take great sacrifices. After all, the Lady may take a liking to one of them. And those she likes, never get to leave. And if they try, they'll spend the rest of their lives as ravens, following in her flock.",

										"The Isle of the Ravens does not have much in the way of wildlife, though the waters around the island are full of fish. The skies, however, are dominated by the ravens that give the island its name, hundreds, if not thousands, of these birds in the sky at any given time. They so completely dominate the Isle that no other birds can be found, not even seagulls from the Noc-turnal Sea. How the ravens sustain themselves is un-known, though most expect that they survive off grubs and worms and whatever they find underneath the bark of the dark trees. There are no known monsters on the island, as none have ever been seen. The few sailors brave enough to sail close to the shore swear that, alongside men,they have seen monsters turned to ravens by the Lady of Ravens, but many suspect that these stories are merely tales or the result of too much drink."

												"The Lady of Ravens was born into a world of silence and isolation. She was the last in a long line of nobility that had long fallen into inbreed-ing and insanity. Her mother died when the Lady was a toddler and the Lady of Ravens neither remembers her nor cares. The Lady's father spent his days in a drugged haze and wandered the halls of the castle, talking to unseen spirits and friends long dead. The Lady never talked to the servants that raised her or took care of her day to day needs,not considering them important enough to matter in any way. The Lady despised the other children that lived in the castle, and they soon learned to avoid her altogether. The Lady of Raven's only joy was the Tower of Flint. A 400 foot tall edifice of gray stone that sat in the middle of her cas-tle, hundreds of ravens roosted in the tower. The Lady of Ravens had inherited the ability to talk to ravens, passed down by her mother. The Lady spent hours in the tower, telling the ravens stories, and listening to the tales they told her in return. After her father's death the Lady rarely left the tower, spending days in conversa-tion with her ravens. This was the way of things un-til the Lady reached her late teens. Looking from the windows of her tower, she spotted a handsome young man. The Lady became obsessed with the man, the son of a servant, and set her ravens to follow his every move. When he departed to fight in some nameless war, she was devastated, barely sleeping or eating for a year. She was overjoyed to hear the news from one of her ravens\u2014the man had returned. Her joy turned to rage when the young man immediately fell into the arms of another woman. Devastated and enraged, the Lady sent her ravens to tear the young lovers apart. Grief stricken, the Lady spent several days in her tower mourning the death of her obsession. When she left she found the Tower of Flint was standing alone on an isle in the middle of a vast sea. To make matters worse, the Lady found she could not remember her own name. Even more devastating, although she could command the ravens of her isle with an act of will, she could no longer talk to her friends."

												"Alain Monette was the infamous captain of the privateer vessel {@i Ouragan}. Monette was an incredible captain. He knew every rope, nail, and barrel of ballast on the Ouragan. He had seen every hazard on the open sea and feared no obstacle, whether natu-ral, magical, or man made. Monette's skill as a captain and his legendary conquests brought sailors flocking to his flag. Once the new sailors were at sea, they found out why Captain Alain Monette constantly took on new crew. Monette was an absolute despot on his ship. Even minor infractions of his complicated and extensive code resulted in brutal beatings and floggings. The shred-ded skins of the sailors that Monette had keelhauled were hung from the yard arms as grisly trophies. Even-tually the crew had too much. Monette had gaff hooks inserted under the rib cage of a sailor who violated one of his obscure codes then dragged the poor fool behind the ship. It didn't take long before splashes of the sailor and trail of blood attracted the attention of sharks. After the sailor stopped screaming the crew, angry and tired of being whipped like dogs, spontaneously mutinied. The officer's joined the crew and Monette was dragged from his cabin and savagely beaten. The crew tied ropes to his hands and legs then keelhauled. Much to the crew's surprise, Monette survived. The crew simply keelhauled him again, and when he survived a third time. Monette stubbornly clung to life, cursing and swearing revenge. The crew stripped Monette and tied him to the mast. The captain was flogged for over an hour. Still Monette refused to die. Out of ideas and tired of the stubborn captain's refusal to die, the crew simply threw him overboard and sailed away. When the crew was out of sight, the captain finally surrendered into unconsciousness. Monette awoke in a cave. Dozens of furry bodies covered him, licking the blood out of his wounds. Bats. Monette was covered in dozens of small bats. He survived the next few days by catching what bats he could and devouring the screeching creatures raw. At night when his wounds proved too much the bats descended and fed on him in turn. Monette didn't know it, but the Dark Powers had noticed the captain and refused to let him die. As he feasted on the bats, the Dark Powers made them one. After a week, Mon-ette could move around and explore his surroundings, finding himself on a small barren island in the middle of a vast sea. At night the constellations were similar to the ones from his home, but somehow wrong. The seas surrounding Monette's island were treacherous and full of shipwrecks. The beaches were covered in the desiccated skeletons of hundreds of sailors. Almost unconsciously, he started stacking the bones at the top of the tallest point of his island. Impossibly the bones fused together, forming a tower. Monette worked tire-lessly for over a month, living off the bats he caught and the plants that grew in the thin soil of his island. The last bone Monette placed was a skull. The skull was set on top of a pillar of fused spines in the highest room of the tower. When the skull was set, it began to glow and raised into the air above the pillar of spines. Monette's tower, a lighthouse he called the Eye of Midnight, was complete. Monette tried to escape the island on a small boat that he cobbled together from detritus that washed ashore on his island. The further he sailed from the island, the weaker Monette became. Before he had sailed a mile, Monette knew he would be dead if he sailed any further. He was trapped."

								"Leederik's Tower, or the Tower of the Phantom Lover, is a unique construct, even within the Mists of Ravenloft, in that it can reliably send sections of itself into extremely limited parts of the multiverse. The big-gest part sits in the Mists of Ravenloft and consists of the Tower itself as well as a maze that stretches around it. The second part consists of the bedroom of a grieving widow, one whose grief is so deep that she is willing to do anything to get her dead husband back. And the third part consists of the nearest cemetery.",
								"Leederik is the worst perversion of consent and a living embodiment of gaslighting. When he senses a widow who misses her husband so much that she's willing to do anything, he will open a portal for one hour to her bedroom. The door will become locked, and while she can leave at any time that she wants, no one else can enter, and he cannot leave. He then spends that time convincing the grieving widow that he is the spirit of her dead husband, leading her to believe that she can still be with him if only she can rescue him. This goes on night after night, though he seeks consent at each stage, and only moves on if she lets him. This is of course increasingly unlikely as time goes on, as her will is destroyed and she starts to disappear into her own shell during the day, only for her to come out at night for the one hour that she has with him. Eventually, she becomes willing to steal, lie, and even murder for his attention \u2014 because he instills the fear that he'll never return and she'll lose her husband permanently. And that is when he makes his ultimate move. On the final night, he beckons to her, asking her to forsake the rest of the world and follow him where he leads. This is to the graveyard, where they appear at the gates of the cemetery, and then they wander onwards to an open grave. There, in front of a stone engraved with the woman's name is a large rectangular pit, with no bottom. This is a portal to his domain, to the laby-rinth itself, and the woman is never seen again. The only thing left behind is a single garment at the grave.",
								"In fact, she does not die, and anyone can use the portal while it's open. (It opens every night at the cemetery for the hour that he is in her bedroom \u2014 anyone ob-serving the grieving widow could put this together, as the victims tend to haunt the cemetery during the day (where the portal is closed and the Phantom Lover is in their domain) without knowing why. The poor victim instead languishes in the labyrinth, unable to survive in the damp, dark realm, and unable to leave. Perhaps she is simply too weak, or perhaps she is paralyzed by the realization of what she has done. This eventually leads to her death, and the cycle then starts again, as the Phantom Lover is doomed to always experience loneliness, no matter how much they want it otherwise. Adventures within this domain should involve foiling the Phantom Lover. For while they cannot be slain while grief and sorrow exist within the multiverse, they can be stopped \u2014 at least temporarily. Perhaps the heroes know a friend who has suffered a terrible loss and has become a widow. She might mention that she's been having visions of her husband (perhaps she's even somewhat resistant to his advances), but in order to truly save her, they'll need to confront the Phantom Lover directly, and destroy them within their own domain.",

Home to only three settlements, and less than 7,000 inhabitants, it has become something of a stopover for sailors on the Nocturnal sea \u2014 a useful place for someone to restock supplies and food, and maybe trade off a few wares. As a result, Liffe is the kind of place that the locals describe as \"nothing inter-esting ever happens here\", but they'd be very wrong. Neverwere mansion is the crux of many (true) local ru-mors about disappearances and the like, while Moon-dale has been subjected to not only vampire attacks but those of werewolves too. The town of Armeikos, meanwhile, was subjected to a strange ghost that pos-sessed people and forced them to commit murders on his behalf. So \"nothing ever happens\" is patently un-true. With everything going on in such a small place, it's difficult to nail down a particular theme, but the sto-ries that take place are often the ones that Baron Lyron Evensong creates during the centuries that he spends in his exile during the night in Neverwere Mansion. Of course, he believes that he is only writing stories about heroes overcoming evil, and his murders during the night never strike him as wrong. Adventures in Liffe al-most inevitably involve going to Neverwere Mansion for the night, as the Baron invites anyone interesting to spend the night, knowing full well that he cannot prey upon the locals without arousing suspicion. Long-lived heroes, like elves and dwarves, are particularly likely to be invited, as is anyone that the Baron might find at-tractive. Of course, getting into the Mansion is the easy part. Slaying the Baron or surviving 100 years might not prove as easy.",

Whenever someone dies here, the Graben family secretly digs them, having done so successfully for over a century, sticks the body in a barrel, and ships it off to Todstein for Meredoth's latest work. This happens at least once a month, sometimes more often, if the family feels like it can get away with it.",

Perhaps they come across them exhuming a body in the middle of the night, or they happen across one of the ships used to send the bodies to Todstein, inside one of the specialized bar-rels that the Graben family uses. Disturbing the flow of bodies to Todstein draws the ire of Meredoth, but it's unlikely to be right away. The Necromancer is patient, but more importantly, so engrossed in his work that he won't notice the interruption for weeks. At that point, he would take steps to ensure that the flow is restored, and if annoyed or provoked, that the heroes are punished.",
								"Should the heroes be unfortunate enough to get to Todstein, they come into direct contact with the nec-romancer himself and the mausoleum that he lives in. The mausoleum is essentially a large death trap, de-signed to capture and slowly kill those who come here, so that their bodies remain intact for Meredoth to work on. Only in the most dire circumstances does the nec-romancer risk himself in direct confrontation.",

Sheep and goats are everywhere, but especially on the northern edge of Graben, where they produce a particularly rich wool. Oth-er animals tend to be smaller, such as otters, bea-vers, squirrels. The beavers that live near Seeheim and Kirchenheim are considered a nuisance as they often attempt to dam up the rivers, reducing the rivers to mere trickles in the heights of summer.",

Once every living thing in the castle was slain, Mere-doth set to work. As he raised his new minions, the mists closed in. When they cleared, Meredoth found that he now lived on an island. Nearby islands would supply the people the arcanist needed for his experi-ments, and the whole area was surrounded by a thick wall of mist that allowed no escape.

They are also an emotional one though, subject to extreme mood swings that overtake them when they're faced with particular crimes, especially that of adultery. In those times, visitors discover why there are no sheriffs or constables in Vechor, as the inhabitants turn to mob justice. The two constants enforced by Easan are these: 1) only wild magic is allowed \u2014 magic of any other kind is illegal and the practitioners are to be killed on sight, and 2) everyone born to the realm must bear the letter E on their forehead, branded there at birth as a way of honoring their king.

This leads many inhabitants to wear fully covering clothes in certain areas, especially near the rivers and swamps, despite the heat and humidity.

During Easan's calmer moments though, the plant life is what you'd expect in a typical jungle. Vines, tall trees with wide leaves and fast-growing trunks, and small-er bushes. Everywhere is normally green and lively, but the humidity is high and the air is heavy. Most of the plants bear luscious fruits, meaning that the locals don't bother with having farmland, and instead focus on gathering fruit and avoiding the beasts that hide among the plants."

Unlike other golems of its kind, it is intelligent as it is inhabited by the soul of a ranger named Ahmi Vanjuko who has sworn vengeance on Easan for his crimes against life and the afterlife.

Window openings are present along the inner walls, but all are of different sizes and shapes, and set at different heights, ranging from those com-fortable for a halfling to look through, all the way up to giants having to stand on their toes to look through. Inside the mansion, it gets worse. The rooms con-stantly shift around, there is no rhyme or reason in them, but no matter when you go in or where, surgical equipment and magical paraphernalia surround you, as well as books focusing on the nature of the soul. These range from philosophical debates on the exis-tence of souls to fiendish treatises focusing on how to extract them from mortals and turn them into abyssal larvae."

The locals here are keen on trade and social life, leading happy lives in spite of the edicts of Easan. There is no prison nor even a local militia house, as the locals enforce their own version of mob rules. Punishment for crimes (whether real or perceived) tends to be light unless it is practicing magic (of any kind other than wild magic) or adultery. On the northern edge of town stands a single building, almost a ruin. It was once dedicated to St. Cuthbert, the deity who the mystics of the original Vechor wor-shipped. Here it stands empty, the only solid in a land of change and chaos, and the only constant that no local acknowledges. No matter the guise that Vechor takes or the appearance and behavior of the inhab-itants, the monastery stands firm and never-chang-ing.

This facet is a single room, a large chamber made from crude bricks, with a low ceiling. An ancient altar stands here, covered in cobwebs, and upon it lies Marble, Chardath's sister, her throat slit, with a river of blood pouring from the open wound. Next to the altar is a closed sarcophagus, into which the blood constantly pours through holes in the lid, without ever overflowing. The woman on the altar appears to be still breathing but is caught in her death throes. Un-fortunately, any attempts to help her triggers an event where the ceiling starts dripping blood \u2014 first a few drops, and then a downpour. And then the room starts filling up, and within an hour, the entire room will have filled with blood, drowning anyone in it. Moving the lid of the sarcophagus triggers the arrival of a blood elemental. In order to exit the facet, the blood elemental, a variant water elemental composed of blood, will have to be slain."

The books here contain every single memory and idea that he's ever had, and could reveal the true nature of Aggarath, both dagger and domain, if studied for long enough. The library is log-ically built up with sections devoted to his childhood, teenage years, adulthood, and so on, as well as the stages he went through. Moving through these times carries its own risk, especially traveling far back, as the further back one moves, the less recognizable the books become, as his memories are twisted by time. Those from his childhood are almost amorphous blobs, rather than books. The future is not available, with that section merely a black void that cannot be entered. Exiting this facet is simple if one has access to detect magic or similar magic, as five books scat-tered around the domain can provide an exit. These five books light up for 10 minutes, any time such mag-ic is cast within the library, no matter how far away the caster is. Finding the books without magic would take a lifetime."

Kaisha cared little for her son and seemed to care even less for her daughter who was born a few years later. Kaisha alternated between berating and ignoring her children. Chardath tried to shield his sister from the worst of it, but she never spoke. He took to calling her Marble to mark her silence and pale beauty.

								"When the big top goes up, and the Carnival ar-rives in town, the residents nearby come out to see the \"freaks\". The irony is that what others see as freaks is the Carnies showing their real nature, while the \"normal people\" wear their disguises, and hide behind whatever is considered acceptable for their society. This goes for both those who are considered the Abominations (those that have been punished by Isolde) or one of the Troupers (those that have been helped by her to release their true selves). The third group of people involved in the Carnival is the Skurra. A group of Vistani who paint themselves with poten-tially magical face paint, but who are either mute or choose never to speak to anyone. They are outside the normal life of the Carnival, and simply accepted and respected as part of the scenery by the performers (Troupers and Abominations). They can be found help-ing to set up the tents, tending animals, and dealing with the day-to-day activities of the Carnival, while the other carnies perform. The Carnival represents things that are not possible to see, as well as being the liv-ing embodiment of poetic justice. The \"monsters\" that people fear, the \"freaks\" that people come to visit and see, are all much closer to their real selves than any of the visitors will ever be. Helped by Isolde, they've found their true being. Whether that is a reward or punishment depends upon the Carny in question. The Carnival is not restricted like other domains. It is like a \"pocket domain\" that moves from one domain to an-other, entirely free of the restrictions imposed by the Darklords over those domains. It can appear anywhere that Isolde wishes, and the inhabitants near where it appears always seem to know that it'll arrive \u2014 of-ten knowing so up to a week in advance. Adventures that involve the Carnival should revolve around these themes, punishing those who behave badly and re-warding those that do good by others, whether or not they recognize that. They'll also revolve around those members of the carnival (especially to be found in the Hall of Horrors) that chafe under the punishment meted out by Isolde, and who plot to one day take her down.",

For this, they praise Isolde as they believe that she is doing this for the greater good. The Abom-inations believe that it turns them into monsters, to be shunned by all. They blame Isolde for her inability to curtail the effect. This causes a great schism within the Carnival with the three factions within (Trouper, Abom-ination, and Skurra) often playing off against each oth-er. The Abominations, led by Professor Pacali (see the Hall of Horrors below) are trying to overthrow Isolde, in the belief that she is causing them grief, and that only through her death will they be free of the effects of the Twisting. The Skurra, led by Madame Fortuna \u2014 a true Vistani seer, who speaks (unlike the other Skurra), believes that Isolde is an angel, one that has blessed them with their presence, and who metes out justice as they see fit. The Troupers, unofficially led by Tindal, the Chief Barker of the Carnival, aren't sure what to believe, but they do know that the Twisting has helped, rather than hindered, them. For that, they are grateful to Isolde. This internal schism is heading towards a confrontation, but Isolde is well aware of what is happening, though she has taken no outward steps to prevent it."

												"Isolde's greatest secret is her very nature. She is a ghaele, a powerful Celestial that wages eternal war against evil on a cosmic scale. Isolde is a natural crusader and was dispatched by her lords to innumerable worlds to lead rebellions against petty tyrants and the diabolic forces of the Nine Hells. Isol-de was rightly lauded as unbeatable in combat, yet all fell apart against one specific incubus. Isolde sought to convince a baroness on a forgotten world to treat her subjects as valued people and improve the lives of all under her leadership. The incubus, rather, wanted the baroness to tax her subjects into abject poverty to fund a lifestyle of debauchery and insatiable lust. Unfortu-nately, Isolde failed and the baroness and her subjects were set on the road to ruin. Isolde swore revenge against the incubus and tracked him across the planes. The incubus, who Isolde came to know was known as the Gentleman Caller, was intelligent and had allies over thousands of worlds. Relentless, Isolde finally managed to corner her prey. The Gentleman Caller, desperate to escape her, fled to the one demiplane he knew Isolde could never enter, Ravenloft. Isolde re-turned to her celestial lords and begged permission to follow the incubus into the demiplane. Her lords agreed but set conditions. She would have to remain in human form, and, once she entered Ravenloft, would never be allowed to leave. Isolde agreed at once. In truth, Isolde would have gone whether her lords gave her permission or not.",
												"Isolde has existed for thousands of years but never ex-pected that somewhere like Ravenloft could exist. So much evil, so much suffering, it took her breath away. Isolde tries to help where she can, but the Gentleman Caller is her obsession. She investigates all leads thor-oughly and will not rest until she has impaled the incu-bus upon the end of her sword. Until that day, Isolde takes care of the Carnival and the performers that call it home. They have become a family to Isolde and she would sacrifice her life for any of them."

If Isolde were to throw off her disguise and start a crusade to save the people that are suffering all around her, she would draw the ire of every evil creature in the demiplane. She would drown in a sea of thousands of raging were-wolves, vampires, and creatures of the night. Isolde finds this situation incredibly frustrating but can see no alternative. Instead, Isolde helps where she can and continues her search for the Gentleman Caller. When the opportunity arises and Isolde can vent her frustra-tion on one of the evils of Ravenloft, she almost feels sorry for the beast. All the lords of Ravenloft are cursed by the Dark Powers, and Isolde is no different. Every intelligent creature within 300 feet of Isolde begins to change.

								"The House of Dark Strategy belongs to Lord Malkant Hilfin, a master strategist, and a gracious win-ner, but a terrible loser. He had been undefeated for years, traveling elsewhere to show off his skills. Lat-er in life, he took to calling others to him from within his house, relying upon his reputation as \"the man to beat\". Every eight years he would announce such a competition and every eight years, the best players of their kind would descend upon the tournament, only to leave a few days later in defeat. For many, many years, such was the pattern until finally one day, Selmar Cal-lista, a hated rival, looked set to win the tournament. In his despair, Malkant listened to the Dark Powers and killed Selmar and his other guests. This drew in the domain and sealed him within it, only able to send out a new call every eight years, hoping that someone would come to face him, and like those before them, lose and die. Any adventures taking place in the House of Dark Strategy will not involve combat. The challenges here will be those of puzzles and skills. Also as Malkant only invites those that are of interest to him, at least a few of the characters should be highly intelligent and skilled in strategy and tactics games. He has no time, and no respect for those that rely on luck. He knows that while he can't always pick and choose, he does try to keep it as challenging as he possibly can due to a partic-ular person's companions.  In many ways the House of Dark Strategy is inspired by an old film called The Seventh Seal, where a knight plays Death at chess, holding him up, and believing he'll stay alive as long as the game is going on. Here, the players would be the knight and Malkant would be Death, though winning here would destroy Malkant.",

												"Lord Malkant Hilfin was one of the best strategic minds of his age. He earned his fortune and title serving in well over a dozen wars as his kingdom became an empire. He never learned to fight, as he well knew that melee combat was base and dirty, but more than made up for it with his mind for logistics and an amazing ability to predict his enemies moves. Malkant always led his armies from the rear, yet they never lost. After his career in the military was over, Malkant turned his genius to games. Every eight years, he would invite the best and brightest minds in the empire to compete with him in a series of increasingly fiendish games. Malkant always played fair, and was gracious in victo-ry, but a raging tyrant when he lost. Malkant considered losing a stain on his honor, and it drove him mad. Only one person was ever able to beat him regularly, Selmar Callista. Selmar was a general of incredible talent that had nearly beaten Malkant a half dozen times on the battlefield. Malkant's reputation was only saved by the vast disparity in numbers he could commit to the bat-tlefield. Even then, Callista had gotten close to winning more than once. Although he would never admit it to himself, Malkant was afraid of the general. One night Selmar wasn't just winning, he was crushing Malkant. Everything Malkant tried failed, and Selmar laughed long and hard as he won. Telling old war stories and lamenting how close he came to crushing Malkant on the field of battle. It was too much for Malkant to bear. While Malkant took advantage of an opportune break to devise a strategy to turn this crushing defeat into a merely humiliating defeat, he was approached by one of the party guests. The woman wore all black, and try as he might, he still cannot remember her face. He only remembers her piercing green eyes. She offered Malkant a deal. If he would kill Selmar then Malkant would never lose again. He accepted without a second thought. He turned and grabbed a fire poker and be-gan to rampage through his own house. He beat every person he found to death. Women, children, servants that had loyally served the general for years all died under his clubbing blows. Selmar was the last to die. As Selmar's last breath left his body, he cursed his foe for a fool and a pathetic egomaniac. Malkant laughed. Once he was finished, he threw back the curtains and opened the windows to ease the smell of blood and fear. He was shocked to discover the house was shrouded in mist."

								"Lemot Sedam Juste was once considered one of the greatest actors in the world. He was an astound-ing performer with a sense for comedy and drama and was widely recognized as such. But, he wanted more, he wanted to be a renaissance man of the stage, able to direct, write, and perform any role. Regrettably, his skills did not lend themselves to tragedy \u2014 which he considered the pinnacle of his art \u2014 and he was even worse as a director. While his stories were great, grip-ping people in with their relatable characters, he some-how always undermined his own stories, and they be-came melodramas or comedy. Unable to accept that it was his own shortcomings, Lemot believed that the actors and stagehands that he worked with were un-dermining his work and that they wanted to destroy his legacy. Finally, one day, he wrote a play where every participant died and then proceeded to change all the stage-props for the real thing. During the play, all the actors died, whether to daggers, torture, or poison. But, as he sat in the audience, Juste heard the booing of the crowd who thought that the gore-fest that they had just watched was ridiculous. In his rage, he locked the doors and torched the theatre, burning everyone inside. As the theatre was full, more than 500 people lost their lives in the conflagration.",
								"Seeking to escape notice, Juste ran and hid in the theatre of one of his friends. He fell asleep and the Mists claimed him.",
								"When he woke, he found himself in an empty theatre, and after frantically searching for a way out, he even-tually grew bored and started writing down ideas for new plays. As he did, he noticed that the stage around him changed, and obeyed his every thought. And when the play was written, an audience came to his door as bidden. Those who wandered onto the stage became actors in the play, while those who stayed in the seats became a spellbound audience. Juste's perception of others has changed as a result. He now sees everyone as part of his play \u2014 not real people, but characters to be played, discarded, and killed as needed. And he still prefers his tragedies and takes criticism extremely poorly. Many are the people who have lost their lives when they gave a negative response to his plays, and he proceeded to torch the theatre. He too burns as the theatre does, but he always comes back, and while the experience is excruciating, he believes it's better than to have people spread word of a less-than-perfect play. Adventures within Scaena should take their inspiration from the theater. Great plays such as Hamlet, Oedipus Rex, Tartuffe, and The Persians can all serve as inspiration. And for the heroes to take part, all it requires is for them to head out for an evening's entertainment before they find themselves at a nice looking theatre, that's putting on the premier of a new show just that evening. Only by breaking through the veils of illusions and somehow finding a way to survive in a world where one man controls and knows everything, can the he-roes make it out alive.",

								"The Eyrie was once a flying castle, involved in a draconic war of continent-spanning, if not world-span-ning, proportions, created by the dragonlord Kravon when he lost his red dragon mount. Even those who follow a man who could work with a dragon in this manner have their limits, and Kravon grew increasing-ly volatile and violent \u2014 slaughtering innocents and his own followers alike. He grew so violent that in a fit of rage, he murdered every single other occupant of his castle, finding himself alone, and trapped in his keep. First physically as he was the only one there, but then by the Mists as he was cursed to never leave the keep.",

Unknowingly the curse transferred to the Baron, but the domain's nature remained unchanged, staying as it was under the previous lord, with one exception \u2014 the previous lord could control the movement of the flying citadel, the Baron cannot. While neither could control the domains that the citadel appears in, Kravon was at least able to control it within the domain itself.",
								"Both of them were imprisoned, and that is what adventures that involve the Eyrie should involve, as the Baron cannot feed himself without the use of his minions. He loathes them for his dependency, and they in turn hate him for utterly controlling them. Both sides remain un-aware of that animosity, however. Which is where the heroes might come in. The minions would be forced to abduct a victim for the Baron, perhaps one of the heroes' friends, bringing that person to the Eyrie, but while they cannot work directly against the Baron, they could leave clues as to where the friend went. They would likely even greet the heroes when they arrived, treating them as guests \u2014 though hiding their true na-ture \u2014 and subtly pushing them into a conflict with the Baron, a task that would be complicated by the werebat leader acting and working as the cook, while one of the minions is forced to pretend to be the Baron himself.",

He and his clan whiled away their nights stalking unfortunate peas-ants. Some, they devoured as a clan. Others they dropped from great heights into steep ravines. For sport, the werebats would judge the length and vol-ume of the peasant screams, the number of ledges they slammed into and how the broken body landed. One day, everything changed. A colossal flying for-tress appeared in the sky above the werebat's moun-tain. Curious, the lycanthropes flew to the fortress and discovered its sole inhabitant, a human dressed in elaborate ornate armor. The human said he was Kravon, a Lord of Dragons. Lance in hand, the human commanded the werebats to bow to him and become his slaves. The werebats attacked. As the last blow fell, only the Baron and two of his companions lived. The Baron declared himself lord of the flying fortress, which he dubbed the Eyrie. When one of his compan-ions challenged the Baron's right to rule, the Baron shredded the fool's wings and threw him from the for-tress. The remaining werebat swore unending loyalty to his new lord and master. The Baron soon discov-ered he couldn't fly far from the Eyrie without being pushed back to the fortress by powerful winds. Even worse, the Eyrie seemed free to travel in any direc-tion, but only those directions contrary to the Baron's wishes. The werebat minion soon returned, along with innocents from the ground below. The Baron in-fected the innocents with the curse of lycanthropy and found they were loyal minions that would follow his every command.

The part or limb uses Gwydion's initiative roll in combat. Gwydion has numerous tentacles, talons, hoofs, two thirteen fingered hands, two smashing fists, one spiked tail and ten withering eyes. Different parts of Gwydion come through the gate at a rate determined by the Dungeon Master.

However, if the heroes seem to be having quite a bit of trouble and could not handle too much resistance, Gwydion could come through the gate far more slowly-perhaps at a rate of one part every two or three rounds. Gwydion passes through the gate completely after 10 minutes of combat and is free to roam the domain. He then uses Freed Gwydion's statblock. Gwydion can be stopped only if a character throws the Crown of Arak (or any other portion of the regalia), the Sword of Arak, or the Dagger of Arak into the Obsidian Gate. This task should not be accomplished too easily, as Gwydion will do everything within his power to stop them. If a creature simply throws it, Gwydion will surely catch it.

He searched through dozens of worlds before he found the ellefolk, distant relatives of elves and skilled artisans. In one horrible night, Gwydion attacked and dragged them all into the Demiplane of Shadow. The ellefolk were forced to worship Gwydion, to attack his enemies and build temples in his name.",

Rather than be grateful for his gift, the ellefolk rebelled. The ellefolk's leader, Arak fought against Gwydion using nine artifacts that combined to give Arak almost god-like powers. Gwydion and Arak's battle tore apart the Demiplane of Shadow and the ellefolk ran for the Obsidian Arch, the only way out. At the gate Arak managed to drive Gwydion back long enough to try and dive through. When Arak turned his back and was distracted by thoughts of escape, Gwydion hit him with a blast of arcane energy that burned him to ash. Arak's young children, Loht and Maeve, had the presence of mind to pull the Regalia of Arak through the gate and seal it. With the Demiplane of Shadow destroyed, Gwydion was trapped inside the Obsidian Arch.",

Arak was a subterranean realm where the ellefolk made their home after they escaped the Demiplane of Shadow. The ellefolk, infused with shadow, could no longer go about in sunlight and changed their name to show they had become a new people. They named themselves after their fallen hero, Arak. Gwydion ruled Arak in secret for centuries, using puppets to carry out his will. When the Grand Conjunction occurred, Gwydion took his chance. He tore open the fabric of Ravenloft, and very nearly escaped, but failed. Where once he ruled Arak, now he ruled the Shadow Rift."

He toiled for centuries to gain power, until he realized what he needed was a race to worship him. He searched through dozens of worlds before he found the ellefolk, distant relatives of elves and skilled artisans. In one horrible night, Gwydion attacked and dragged them all into the Demiplane of Shadow. The ellefolk were forced to worship Gwydion, to attack his enemies and build temples in his name.",
							"After centuries Gwydion started to feel something akin to affection for his slaves, and invested them with the essence of the Demiplane of Shadow. Rather than be grateful for his gift, the ellefolk rebelled. The ellefolk's leader, Arak fought against Gwydion using nine artifacts that combined to give Arak almost god-like powers. Gwydion and Arak's battle tore apart the Demiplane of Shadow and the ellefolk ran for the Obsidian Arch, the only way out. At the gate Arak managed to drive Gwydion back long enough to try and dive through. When Arak turned his back and was distracted by thoughts of escape, Gwydion hit him with a blast of arcane energy that burned him to ash. Arak's young children, Loht and Maeve, had the presence of mind to pull the Regalia of Arak through the gate and seal it. With the Demiplane of Shadow destroyed, Gwydion was trapped inside the Obsidian Arch.",

Arak was a subterranean realm where the ellefolk made their home after they escaped the Demiplane of Shadow. The ellefolk, infused with shadow, could no longer go about in sunlight and changed their name to show they had become a new people. They named themselves after their fallen hero, Arak. Gwydion ruled Arak in secret for centuries, using puppets to carry out his will. When the Grand Conjunction occurred, Gwydion took his chance. He tore open the fabric of Ravenloft, and very nearly escaped, but failed. Where once he ruled Arak, now he ruled the Shadow Rift."

Nathan possessed a severe wanderlust from an early age and left the clan to wander the lands of the Core when he was barely in his teens. Nathan moved from domain to domain hunting humans and slaughtering small villages as his whims drove him. He found a boat and began to travel the River Musarde, occasionally offering charters or dabbling in some river piracy.",

							"Nathan rarely had time for his children, especially little Alfred. The boy grew up lonely and neglected. Alfred would later become the dark lord of Verbrek. With the creation of Arkandale came Nathan's greatest curse. He could never leave his ship again. If he touched the shore he would be wracked with pain and slowly become weaker until he couldn't move. If he stayed on shore long enough he wouldn't have the strength to move at all, but would never die. Still, Nathan made the best of his life. He commanded his werewolf minions to attack any other boat on the river and slaughter the crew, and soon Nathan had the only ferry on the River Musarde. His rates were astronomical but everyone was forced to pay them. Priscilla died soon after his children were born, some say trying to escape her husband, and Nathan kidnapped a woman named Arabella. Nathan has turned her into a werewolf and controls her completely.",

					"Strahd has a commanding figure, lean and muscular with a regal demeanor. His features are chiseled and muscular, his eyes commanding, and his voice rich and full. He moves with fluid ease and talks with the authority of one who expects to be heeded. His pale complexion detracts from his image of strength, but eating restores color to it and gives him a healthier aspect. His ears, which are pointed like those of an elf, his most peculiar aspect. He occasionally conceals this by combing his black hair over the tips, but he can easily explain them away by falsely claiming to be descended from elves, so he normally does not bother hiding them unless he is attempting not to be identified. His long, pointed nails are also unique, and he frequently conceals them with gloves. Strahd's fangs, unlike those of other vampires, are easily concealable, retracting when he no longer requires them. Strahd wears the finery of a Barovian nobleman, favoring black with red and white accents. He favors long cloaks and a gold necklace with a huge red stone around his neck.",
					"Strahd was doomed to be the devil long before his human birth. Count Strahd von Zarovich was a decent man with a talent for alchemy. Harrowed by his darker impulses, he employed the Apparatus, an experimental magical-alchemic contraption, to separate his evil and toxic half from himself and hurl it away. Unbeknownst to the Alchemist, this wicked side was reborn elsewhere in the multiverse as Strahd von Zarovich, who went on a crusade to take back the lands of his ancestors and eventually doomed himself to vampire-dom. Before Strahd's birth, Baba Lysaga had made a pact with Mother Night to dedicate a baby, born of noble lineage to her. In exchange Lysaga would have power and enjoy immortality. When Strahd was born, she recognized the baby Strahd's potential for evil and realised that it was the baby destined for her goddess. Lysaga approached the Zarovich family and wormed her way into their home in the guise of a midwife for Queen Ravenovia van Roeyen, Strahd's mother. Lysaga ensured that Strahd would be able to cast spells and follow an evil path by using the baby as a conduit for bloody rituals cast over empty graves under the full moon. When Ravenovia realised what Lysaga's actions were doing, she cast her away to protect Strahd. His destiny was already determined as he had a dark soul of and a chain of villainy tied to his life's web. Although Lysaga was dismissed, she kept close to Strahd to ensure that her \"son\" grew up as intended. Strahd's father was cruel and mostly absent, only caring for his crusades and political schemes. Barov only cared that Strahd would be trained as his successor in warfare and politics. He never considered him as his son but as a tool to further his schemes. Strahd had a difficult childhood, always trying to prove himself worthy of his father's attention. Eventually Strahd determined himself on the path to reclaim his ancestral lands from the Tergs. While still mortal, he made a pact with the arcanaloth Inajira, bargaining for military success in return for eternal servitude, and receiving a valuable artifact from Inajira as collateral, further sealing his fate. Strahd was renowned as a heroic general with ideals similar to that of a paladin, but that would later change. When he rebuilt Castle Ravenloft atop the old keep's ruins, he invited his family to join him. Barov would show no appreciation for his son's achievements, and Lysaga lethally poisoned Ravenovia as she made her way to the castle. Strahd had managed to achieve his dream but none recognised it, making him feel hollow. Sergei, his younger brother, was the only one family member to come to the castle. Strahd saw in Sergei everything that he could be but wasn't. He had spent most of his life chasing empty wishes. Sergei eventually fell in love with a village maiden named Tatyana, Strahd became obsessed with her. In her young life and passion, he saw what his brother had, what he wanted to steal from Sergei, what he had never had: youth and purity... Strahd tried to approach Tatyana to express his desires, but she saw him only as an elder brother to her true love, Sergei.",
					"In his depression, a whispered evil approached. A creature that Strahd knew was \"Death\". Death gave him knowledge of an ancient temple made of amber, hidden at the tallest peak of the Balinok Mountains. There, Strahd found an entity, Vampyr. The trapped vestige offered him immortality in exchange for a sacrifice. Strahd was fated to kill the person he loved the most and in turn be killed by those that hated him with passion. On Tatyana and Sergei's wedding day, Strahd murdered his brother with a Baal Verzi dagger, a relic from a society of dark assassins. In her despair, Tatyana threw herself from the castle walls. Strahd's enemies made their move, bolts and an arrow piercing his. body. Yet, he would not die but rather would be \"reborn\" in undeath. He became the first vampire and welcomed the mists, thus creating Ravenloft. Strahd's curse is that though he is absolute lord and master of Barovia, to the point where he can enter any home as the land's rightful owner, once in every generation he will meet a woman whom he believes is Tatyana reincarnated. As he tries to claim her, she always dies, spurned his advances in horror. Tatyana's latest reincarnations always evade his grasp. Strahd has had to deal with at least two darklords in the past: Azalin Rex the lich and Lord Soth the death knight. The visage of Ravenloft has altered dramatically over the years, but one constant always remains: Strahd.",

							"Strahd set in motion events that cursed not only himself and Barovia, but also many other lands, by making a pact with an unseen entity that he assumed to be Death itself, and murdering his brother to cement that. It is unknown if Ravenloft would exist in its current form without Strahd's evil, although his evil appears to have had a considerable role in it. Strahd has grown in evil and might during the period of the tale recorded in The Tome of Strahd, becoming a necromancer of immense power and learning much about the prison that binds him. He has interacted with most of the Core's great characters, establishing alliances and enmities that have shaped the face of Ravenloft to this day. His partnership with Madame Eva, where he offered the Vistani free passage in exchange for them becoming his informants, is particularly noteworthy. Strahd despises the lich Azalin, who was once his reluctant servant, but is now his greatest nemesis. Their antagonism reached a climax at the Grand Conjunction, when Azalin came dangerously near to annihilating Strahd, but Strahd survived that encounter as he has every other. When Lord Soth arrived in Castle Ravenloft, Strahd understood that Soth's strength was actually a match for him. Armies of Strahd's slaves were defeated by Lord Soth, and the devastation and destruction inflicted by Soth compelled even Strahd to reconsider. Strahd had to give Lord Soth what he had sought, the disloyal retainer Caradoc, in order to remove Lord Soth from Barovia, for fear of the death knight wrecking further damage to his kingdom."

							"Strahd has little involvement in the politics of Barovia, only sometimes venturing from his fortress to see that his rules are enforced. Despite his disdain for the wellbeing of his people and his scorn for most other beings, he fiercely guards his property. Barovia and its people are his to rule over, and any who attempt to defy him will suffer the full force of his wrath. Strahd has been a vampire for nearly four centuries and has learnt to plot in ways that few humans can. His machinations are never as straightforward as they appear, and he will never reveal the underlying reasoning behind his acts. He is inhumanly patient and is ready to outlast his adversaries if that is what it takes to overcome them. He is merciless at heart, and if he perceives an opportunity to quash a possible danger, he will seize it. Strahd's greatest flaw is his attachment to Tatyana. Though she hurled herself to what must have been certain death, her body was never found, and countless women have been born in Barovia who resemble her in every way save name over the decades. Strahd believes that these women are reincarnations of his lost love and that with each he gets a new chance to win Tatyana's heart. Unfortunately, every attempt has failed. Something constantly snatches his intended away from him before he can claim her, and each failure stings him more and more. Strahd will go to any lengths in his pursuit of Tatyana."

							"Strahd is possibly the most deadly of Ravenloft's dark-lords. He is very civil, and even nice when he wants or needs to be, and holds himself to the highest standards of aristocratic behavior. He is a powerful necromancer and a skilled swordfighter, both traits augmented by his vampiric nature. He has created unique variants of classic undead types, such as zombies, skeletons, and skeleton horses, that are far more powerful than standard variations as well as a \"super-zombie\", that is capable of seeing the invisible, regenerates as a troll, and whose appendages continue to battle even when severed. He combines force and cunning to an extent that few can equal. He has created many custom spells to fit his needs. He is well-versed in the application of his vampiric talents and battles his opponents with speed, ferocity and ruthlessness. He is immune to many of the flaws that plague the common vampire and exploits these advantages to surprise the would-be vampire slayers he encounters. He is an accomplished necromancer who uses his spells to lethal effect. Despite his personal power, Strahd is not rash and will not risk himself when another can do the job. He has a plethora of henchmen at his disposal, ranging from animal servants to vampire slaves to magically summoned beasts. Strahd can summon worgs, rather than wolves, unlike most vampires. He has the ability to summon 1d10 Strahd zombies or 2d10 Strahd skeletons. Strahd has free action to open or close the two major gates on the Old Svalich Road from anywhere in his territory. He wields comparable authority over the gates and doorways of his Castle, where he can detect the entrance of any creature with an Intelligence score of at least 3. Strahd can control his carriage without focusing, as if he were at the reins, from anywhere in his territory. He can detect the presence of any creature with an Intelligence of at least 3 that approaches the carriage within 30 feet and can also detect when such a creature enters the carriage. Strahd has a contingency set on him that teleports him to a hidden mountain sanctuary whenever he is exposed to light that may harm him or curb his power. Strahd is unaffected by garlic, mirrors, or holy symbols. He is free to enter any building in Barovia, whether he is invited or not. Strahd can withstand up to ten rounds of sunlight before succumbing to its effects by concentrating on a summoned cloud of bats that engulfs him, creating a perfect shadow cover. Strahd's greatest weakness is Tatyana.",
							"Strahd will take chances he would not otherwise take when chasing one of Tatyana's reincarnations, and he is prone to oversights and miscalculations in his desire for her that would otherwise be at odds with his brilliant mind and detached, pragmatic personality.",
							"Even if Strahd is defeated, the Dark Powers will not let him die so easily. After some time he will reappear as the ruler of Barovia. The only possible way to stop Strahd from existing is to kill the vampire and, before he is brought back to life, slay the alchemist of Mordent. An evil act that would most likely result in the birth of a new darklord. There is also another way; if somehow the Alchemist is convinced to visit his dark counterpart and merge with his evil self via the Apparatus, the vampire Strahd would cease to exist. Such a thing would be almost impossible to happen though, since neither the Alchemist nor Strahd would ever agree to this."

							"When Strahd tries to seal his territory, a dense fog rises from the ground to envelop his domain. This fog is similar to the mists that cover the settlement of Barovia. The fog ring that surrounds the settlement of Barovia is a terrible toxin that lies dormant until one unlucky person tries to flee the village. While entering the village of Barovia it is quite safe, leaving is a different story. Any creature without poison immunity who goes beyond the fog's outer border dies instantly in a foaming fit of apoplexy (no saving throw). A Vistana may create an elixir that makes a creature resistant to the effects of the fog for 10 minutes. The Vistani sell this elixir and guide travelers through the dense fog for 5 gold pieces per person. This is referred to as the \"captive charge\" by giorgio merchants, yet without this service, the trail of goods through the southern Balinoks would cease to flow. The Vistani, on the other hand, never allow giorgio (vistani for city dwellers) to learn the elixir's recipe, and they will refuse any traveller without hesitation if Strahd commands them to."

His eyes are bright blue, and his thin lips are usually drawn up in a quirky grin. Ivan is 68, but has the vitality of a man half his age. A true fop, Ivan fancies himself a great actor and master of the arts. When he is not clad in the finest of Borcan and Dorvinian fashions, he dons theatrical costumes ranging from that of a court jester to a paladin. Ivan has a soft, tenor voice with a high, rapid laugh, but at a moment's notice, both can change. His voice can become a low, velvety whisper or a dramatic boom. He enjoys changing his voice often since he believes it illustrates his theatrical talents. Ivan will gesture dramatically and rapidly pace back and forth to punctuate his words, giving the impression that he's less a man and more an animated marionette.",

A sudden illness forced the Dilisnya family to leave the celebration, sparing them from the following slaughter, yet didn't protect them from being drawn in by the mists and trapped in Ravenloft.When a distant cousin, Camille Dilisnya, was made the darklord of Borca, Ivan's parents and sister, Kristina, ignored her disdain for them and moved into the new domain. Five years later, both Camille and Ivan's mother bore children on the same night and dark moon. It was pure coincidence that Ivan and Camille's daughter, Ivana, had similar names, but the children shared a dark bond from an early age.",
							"Ivan was enraged with the world and vented his frustration upon those unfortunate souls nearest to him.",
							"From torturing animals at the tender age of six, poisoning his first victim at ten (a servant child who stole a pastry) to poisoning his own mother at the age of twelve. The only people who were immune to this treatment were his childhood playmate, Ivana Boritsi, and his sister whom he loved dearly. In return she doted on her \"dearest little brother\", blind to the evil that welled inside of him. Tragically that all came crashing down. His love turned to bitter jealousy when she was married and then became inchoate rage when she bore a child. Hurt, Ivan poisoned his sister and her husband (the lucky child was stolen away by a midwife). Now at the age of 21, his family discovered his foul deeds and chased him from town. With nowhere to go, Ivan fled into the mists where the domain of Dorvinia was created for him.",
							"Despite the curses that were inflicted upon him by the Dark Powers, Ivan's corrupt rule of Dorvinia proved far from dull. From the poisoning of Vlad Drakov's troops when they tried to attack his domain, to his intriguing letters to Ivana over the finer techniques of poisoning, and finally, his marriage to Lucretia who later became a victim of uxoricide after faking the deaths of their three children. What really changed things for Ivan was the Grand Conjunction when earthquakes and general chaos allowed him to leave his realm and head straight to Ivana. Given Ivana's more dominant personality, she renamed  the newly combined lands to Borca and took over the duties of state,while Ivan was given control over the new domain's police, military, and tax collection forces. But, like anything in the mists, it all went to hell..."

The two have become bitter enemies, with a hand on each other's throat and a desire to poison each other. The cousins try to poison each other constantly, but neither has found an effective toxin. Every night he wakes up in a cold sweat, screaming his sister's name.",
							"When he's not running the police and tax collectors, Ivan holds dinner parties (to live vicariously through other's tastebuds) or supporting the arts in his own way by hiring theatre and opera tropes to come to his estate and making his own changes to the act midway through the production.",

Three times a day, Ivan can turn a small non-magical object into poison dust via his touch. The poison must be ingested and he can create one of three types. The creature that ingests the poison must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. If the creature fails, the effect varies based on the type of poison Ivan created.

Ivan Dilisnya commands fanatical loyalty among his inner circle of servants, guards and spies, chiefly through his use of an insidious poison known as Borrowed Time. This venom courses permanently through the veins of Ivan's key minions. Ivan poisoned these souls with Borrowed Time years ago, laying a sentence of death that only he can stay.",

Ivan is fickle however, and even the appearance of disloyalty can provoke Ivan to withhold Mercy at the last moment.

							"Camille was beautiful, with long, dark hair, full lips and a small waist. Between her beauty and her fortune, by the time she had reached fifteen, dozens of suitors wanted her hand. Her father chose Siegfried Grymig and in 681 BC the couple were married. Siegfried was not handsome, but was a Barovian boyar with an ancient family that dominated the wool trade in southern Barovia. He was wealthy beyond measure and the children of Siegfried and Camille would inherit vast political influence and wealth. Camille was happy enough for three years until she discovered her husband was indulging in one of the oldest of  boyar customs, he was having an affair. His lover was Maria Diazi, a servant girl that worked in the manor. Incensed beyond measure, Camille seduced the local alchemist and convinced him to give her the most painful poison he could make. What he gave her was a draught called the Wasting. The victim would be locked inside their own body, unable to move but their nerves would be on fire as the poison slowly dissolved their nervous system. Through the magic of the poison, the creature would remain conscious until death took them.",
							"Camille gleefully took the poison and tested it on the foolish but helpful alchemist. Satisfied with the results, Camille returned to her manor and prepared a special dinner. She insisted Maria join her and her husband at dinner. The young girl and Siegfried were definitely nervous, but Camille insisted. She had lived in the manor for three years and knew nothing of the servants that lived there. She was going to have dinner with one servant every week until she knew them all. As the first course was served, Siegfried and Maria ate in silence while Camille talked of her day.",
							"After a few bites the poison had taken effect. With Maria and Siegfried defenseless, Camille unceremoniously dumped them on the ground. She took a  poker from the fireplace and held it over Maria. She taunted the young woman while searing her flesh with the poker. By the time the poor servant girl died, her eyes, nose, and tongue had been burned to ashes. Camille blamed the murders on the alchemist. She concocted an elaborate story about the alchemist falling in love with her and trying to poison Siegfried and Camille while taking the poison himself. The poor servant girl had taken the poison by accident and fallen into the fire. The local authorities did not wish to dispute the word of Lady Dilisnya, and the murders became an open secret in Mordent. Siegfried's family was a completely different issue. They swore revenge for his death. After a few close calls the Dilisnya's sent Camille to live with distant relations in Invidia. As she crossed into the misty borders between domains, she was given Borca. Since becoming the darklord of Borca, Lady Dilisnya has been granted the ability to craft any poison she can imagine. The ingredients and preparation process forms in her mind as she thinks about the effect she wants the poison to have. She can even create supernatural poisons, although she has no arcane knowledge herself.",
							"The Lady Dilisnya was also cursed that any man she ever loved would betray her. She married three more times, and all of her husbands betrayed her for another woman or man. Despite being married four times Camille has only had one child, a daughter Ivana.",
							"When Ivana was seventeen she was engaged to Pieter, a poet and songwriter of no small talent. After a few months of courting, Pieter and Ivana managed to find one of the rarest commodities in Ravenloft, love. Camille was enraged at the thought and swore Ivana would never have something she could not. The darklord dressed as her daughter and went to her lover in the dead of night. She seduced Pieter and made sure they were discovered by Ivana.",
							"Ivana turned her back on Pieter and demanded he leave the manor they shared with her mother. Camille smiled as the young man left. With a little prodding, Ivana poisoned him a week later. Ivana was furious with her mother, but Camille knew she had actually performed a favor for her daughter. She had shown Ivana the true nature of men."

While he worked Daglan used his magic to spy on the warlord and his inner counsel. What he heard made him rage. The warlord had decided Daglan had become too powerful and must be slain.",

As the campaign ended, Daglan saw the trap. He was isolated from his disciples during the final battle, surrounded by the warlord and his retinue of fanatical bodyguards. As the final elf fell, Daglan felt the spear point slam into his back. As he fell from his horse, his soul was transferred to one of the gems in the warlord's crown.",

The skirmish was brief but the Crown of Souls was lost, knocked from the warlord's head by a stray arrow and rolling into mists that had started to surround the battlefield. In the confusion the crown was found by one of the surviving elves as they fled the battlefield. The elf placed the crown upon his head and his soul was drawn into the crown. The elf's soul and Daglan have fought for supremacy inside the crown ever since. Daglan is stronger but the elf weakens Daglan to the point that he cannot possess anybody that wears the crown. Daglan can only possess dead bodies killed within 30 feet of the crown. As the years crept on, Daglan discovered that every time one of his descendants died, Daglan was able to feed on their soul and grow stronger.

							"Radaga was born in Kartakass, sometime after the domain was pulled into Ravenloft. As she grew up, she knew nothing about her parents; her mother died during childbirth and her father disappeared just a day after her birth. As an abandoned child, she was sent to a monastery, to be raised in the faith of the sisters there. The monastery was one of a handful that were dedicated to the Raven Queen on the Core. It sat over an extensive set of catacombs, and was one of the few areas in Ravenloft free from the scourge of the undead. Radaga grew into a beautiful, yet isolated woman. Male visitors to the monastery always fawned over her and she soon considered them little more than expendable tools that could be used and discarded. As time passed, Radaga became increasingly concerned that one day her looks would fade. Whenever she looked in a mirror, she could see a million small flaws reflected back at her. She never understood how others couldn't see them. Her sisters at the monastery always commented on her beauty, but Radaga knew they were lying. As time passed, she knew they were mocking her.",
							"She could see the flaws in her beauty, and her sisters clearly had to see them. There was no way they could miss them. One day, as she spoke the endless prayers of her order, Radaga had a vision. A woman lying on a stone slab, a dagger above her heart. The dagger was brought down. The woman on the stone slab screamed as she aged a century or more in seconds. The vision expanded. Radaga saw the back of the woman with the dagger. When she turned around Radaga saw herself. She was perfect. Absolutely flawless. Radaga became obsessed with the stone table and the dagger.",
							"She tried to remember every detail of the table, the dagger, the room, anything. It haunted her dreams and her waking hours. Radaga took to wandering aimlessly through the halls of her monastery, often finding herself deep in the catacombs. Deep, deep in the catacombs, she finally found the table, and it was there that her descent into madness truly began. Radaga began to lure her sisters into the catacombs, often under the pretense of praying in a small chapel she had discovered. Once in the catacombs, Radaga would disable her victims with her spells and sacrifice them to her vanity on the altar. Her perceived flaws vanished, although new ones always appeared. It was only a matter of time before she was discovered. Radaga fled the monastery mere minutes before her vengeful sisters gave chase. Radaga fled to the mists, and, with that, the domain of Daglan was born. As the domain formed around her, Radaga found a crown, inlaid with precious jewels and made of the purest gold. The crown called to her, but Radaga did not know why."

If she is slain before Daglan can be freed from the crown, and if her death doesn't give Daglan the power to shatter his prison and return to life, then the Dark Powers will resurrect her as a wight. Her wight form will be as hideous as her human form is beautiful. She will still maintain all of her clerical abilities but will be formidable in hand to hand combat as well. Wight Radaga will hit harder than an average wight and her touch will drain some of the life force of her victim. She will be immune to nonmagical weapons, and immune to turning attempts from enemy clerics. Radaga can transform humans in her domain into goblyns, giving her an army of the corrupted monstrosities at her beck and call. She can also create and control a variety of undead. Radaga is rarely alone, and one of her favorite tactics in battle is to summon more minions or corrupt nearby innocents and throw them into the fray. She still obsesses over her beauty, although she is easily the most beautiful woman in the domain. She sees flaws all over her body and face. Anyone that compliments her looks is sure to draw her hatred."

His first target was the village whose mob had murdered his parents. The village was burnt to the ground and the villagers sold into bondage.

							"In the kingdom of Chesrush, the Gundar family was never quite enough. For generations they were pig farmers. Though they were well off, living on a large farm, they still lived in the mud and sold food to their betters. Then came Lord Callar's rebellion. Milak Gundar joined the forces of King Brun to save the kingdom, leaving his young son Nharov and wife behind. When Milak returned two years later, he was missing a hand, and came riding a fine horse,bearing the title of lord. Milak had saved King Brun from an ambitious spearman, at the cost of his hand. The grateful king had given Milak the title of lord and Callar's estates as a thank you. Milak had serfs that would work his farm for him now, as well as hundreds of acres of wineries and farms.",
							"Milak and his family were welcomed by the king when they moved into the Callar estates in the capital of Navar. Milak was hailed as  a war hero and Nharov thought his life would be perfection. He was very wrong. Callar and his family came from an old house and were well connected and liked by their peers. In giving Callar's land and estates to Milak, the king sent a simple message \"If I can do it to them, I can do it to you.\" Callar and his sons were slain during the rebellion, but his wife and daughter were taken in by relatives when the Gundars evicted them from their home.",
							"Once the king's attention turned elsewhere the nobles that had fawned over Milak and his family began to openly mock the Gundars for their simple ways and ignorance. In less than a year Milak had lost the fortune he gained during the war through drinking, gambling and whoring. Nharov's mother left and never returned.",
							"Milak barely noticed his wife's absence. He was too busy begging other nobles for money that slipped through his fingers as soon as he got it. Nharov was left alone, surrounded by nobles that despised him for being born, and enemies that would rather see him dead.",
							"A few years later, Milak succumbed to a death from alcohol and debauchery. Nharov was left alone. The servants took what they could carry from the estate and left. Duke Nharov Gundar was forced to beg in the streets to find food. Loudly mocked by his peers, whenever he fought back, he always lost to his enemy's great numbers.",
							"By the time Nharov reached adulthood, he had secured several sources of income, using his vast estates to smuggle in and hide all manner of vice. His vast palace in Navar held nearly a dozen brothels, opiate pits, and other more specialized dens of debauchery. Nharov was even able to bribe another pauper lord for his daughter's hand in marriage. Despite his wealth, Nharov was more of a social and political outcast than ever. Nharov sneered as he was mocked. Some of the nobles mocking him were his best customers. Nharov was their better, and he knew it, but he had no way to prove it. All that changed one night when a stranger arrived at Nharov's doorstep. The stranger offered Nharov a means of revenge. He could slay all the nobles that mocked him, and their numbers would count for nothing. All he wanted in return was Nharov's wife. Nharov agreed immediately, Even as the stranger revealed his long fangs, Nharov had no regrets. When Nharov awoke, he could feel his great strength. He waited until nightfall and then began to move through Navar. Finding nobles, whether by themselves or in small groups, regardless, he slaughtered them all. As he killed the mists arose.",
							"Nharov found himself in a strange land. Surrounded by people that called him Duke Gundar. He accepted their fealty without comment and set to building his hall.",
							"Gundar ruled like a petty tyrant. He worked his peasants and taxed everything. He even levied a tax on peasants that had a female baby, as Gundar didn't think they would work as hard. Gundar turned anyone that he thought might be useful into a vampire and didn't give a damn who knew.",
							"It was this hubris that was his downfall. Dr Daclaud Heinfroth had become a unique type of vampire after transfusing cerebral fluid from one of Gundar's many vampire wives into his own skull. Because the wife had been Gundar's thrall, Heinfroth became so as well. Gundar lauded his mastery over the doctor, berating and beating him mercilessly.",
							"Eventually Heinfroth had enough. He played on Gundar's ego and convinced the duke that Heinfroth could rule over neighboring Kartakass, should Harkon Lukas be slain. Gundar was desperate to have a thrall in charge of a second domain and agreed. At a crucial moment, Heinfroth abandoned the duke, and Gundar was slain, with a stake piercing his chest. In an instant the flesh shrivelled from Gundar's skeleton and he fell to the ground lifeless."

His rise to power did not go unnoticed and he made many enemies. The most hated of his rivals was Thantosya, a necromancer. Hazlik craved Thantosya's power, her position, and wealth. Most of all, he craved Orliab, Thantoysa's lover.  Hazlik pursued Orliab, and for a time she did not return his affections. After years of dogged pursuit, she finally relented. Orliab agreed to meet Hazlik in her tower, but it was a trap. Thantosya gathered all Hazlik's enemies together and watched as Orliab served him drugged wine. Once Hazlik could no longer defend himself, Thantosya and her allies sprung the trap. Hazlik was easily overwhelmed. Thantosya didn't want to kill Hazlik, that would be too easy and too quick. Thantosya wanted to make an example.",
							"They marked Hazlik with women's tattoos, deeply humiliating for a Thayan man.  Hazlik's rise to power came to an abrupt halt. His peers ignored him in the streets, and jeered at him behind his back. Hazlik, enraged, threw himself into his craft. He would have his revenge by becoming the most powerful wizard in the history of Thay.  For years Hazlik studied and advanced his magic. While Orliab and Thantosya advanced socially, Hazlik pushed the boundaries of magic. While searching the woods one night for a rare ingredient for one of his experiments, Hazlik came across Orliab and Thantosya unaware. Full of rage, Hazlik easily overcame his enemies. Once Thantosya and Orliab were defeated and helpless, Hazlik gave into years of planned revenge. Hazlik tore the skin from Orliab, and made Thantosya drink the blood of her lover, as well as a hundred acts even more terrible. Then, when Hazlik's lust was sated, he slew them both.",
							"As Hazlik turned to leave, the mists closed in, as he found himself in the Nightmare Lands. Hazlik was repulsed by the alien nature and soon retreated back into the mist. Hazlik lived in the mist for months. He thought he had fallen into another trap from one of his enemies in Thay, so he plotted his revenge. When the mist lifted, Hazlik had been granted the domain of Hazlan. Once Hazlik realized he had been spirited to a realm he couldn't leave, no matter how much magical power he acquired or knowledge he learned, he went mad. For thirty years, Hazlik was the only person allowed to study arcane magic in Hazlan. Any other arcane spellcaster was hunted down and killed. Hazlik passed the time trying to escape Ravenloft. His experiments usually required the unwilling assistance of some of his subjects. His subjects never survived. This changed during the Grand Conjunction. When the walls of the domain of Dread weakened, Hazlik found himself in Thay. He saw his enemies had gained power and prestige and were raising a new generation. When Hazlik returned to Hazlan he had a new plan. He created the Red Academy and started taking apprentices."

His satraps know the price of failure or rebellion and Hazlik never hesitates to remind them. Hazlik spends all of his time in the Red Academy. He hopes that one day an apprentice will escape and return to Thay. Hazlik is getting older, but isn't ready to die yet. Hazlik plans to switch bodies with one of the students in his Red Academy, and carefully watches his apprentices to judge which one has the qualities he would want in a new body. He thinks he has found the perfect vessel in Eleni of Toyalis, a talented wizard and Hazlik's closest confidant. Swapping bodies with Eleni isn't a perfect solution because women are looked down upon by the Iron Faith, so Hazlik is keeping his options open for now. Hazlik has outwardly accepted his imprisonment in Ravenloft, but all is not as it seems. The Red Academy and the town it lies in, Ramulai, are designed in unusual ways. Arcane casters can sense the power drawn to the area by the design. Ramulai and the Red Academy were designed by Hazlik himself, and some say built by magic overnight. Hazlik tolerates the Iron Faith. As a wizard, he is anathema to many of the faithful, but Hazlik could have the entire church wiped out overnight. The Iron Faith keeps its rhetoric to a minimum in Hazlan, and Hazlik uses the church as a form of social control and outlet for his subjects. Hazlik's sleep is wracked by nightmares. In them, his enemies are powerful and unstoppable and he cowers before them. Hazlik uses potions and spells to stay awake but constantly seeks for more effective solutions."

Gabrielle loves gold and wears rings on each finger and large gold hoop earrings. She is barefoot, but never seems to cut her feet on sharp stones.",
					"No one knows her exact age but Gabrielle has the body and face of a woman in her mid-twenties. Only a small streak of gray at her temple hints that she might be older. Gabrielle hates mirrors and will not abide having them nearby. In mirrors, Gabrielle looks like an attractive middle aged woman to everyone except herself. Gabrielle sees a hag. Her skin is gray, her eyes white with cataracts, and her hair falls out in clumps.",

							"Gabrielle was born in Richemulot to Isabella Aderre. Isabella was a Vistani that was cast from her clan and captured by slavers. Isabella was beautiful and was sold to Vlad Drakov, the ruler of Falkovnia, a heartless psychopath who revelled in causing pain. By the time Isabella escaped, she was two months pregnant with Gabrielle. Mother and daughter wandered the domains of the Core for years, stealing, begging and swindling to survive.",
							"During their travels, Isabella never told Gabrielle about her father. When Gabrielle asked, Isabella would tell the young girl that her father was evil and his evil infected everything that it touched. Isabella told Gabrielle that she must never marry, and never have children. Gabrielle, angry and isolated, began to blame her mother for all the hardship they encountered. Every time they were kicked and beaten, spit on and chased out of town, Gabrielle's hatred for her mother grew.",
							"Gabrielle would daydream that her father was rich and powerful. She longed for the day he would save her from her wretched life.",
							"It was while they wandered that Isabella noticed Gabielle's gift. Gabrielle was a natural sorcerer. At first it was small things, Gabrielle could influence others. Soon, when angered, Gabrielle could summon fire.",
							"When Gabrielle was nineteen, she and her mother were ambushed by a pack of werewolves. Gabrielle was able to drive the wolves back for a time, but her mother was injured. Realizing her opportunity, Gabrielle refused to give her mother a healing potion until Isabella told her the truth about her father. Isabella, grievously injured, told Gabrielle about her time as a slave and being sold to a monster. No matter what, Isabella would not tell Gabrielle her father's name.",
							"Gabrielle listened quietly. When Isabella finished, Gabrielle turned and left her mother to the howling pack. Gabrielle's only possession she left with was an ancient Tarokka deck that once belonged to Madame Eva herself. Gabrielle fled into the mists and found herself in Invidia. At that time Invidia was ruled by a powerful werewolf named Bakholis. Bakholis was strong, but dim witted. Gabrielle soon infiltrated his court and one night slit his throat with a silver dagger. That night Invidia got a new darklord. Gabrielle adapted to her new home quickly. She took a succession of lovers, but none of them meant anything to her. That changed with the Gentleman Caller. The Caller appeared in her court one night, silent but impossible to miss. She kept him as a dalliance for a while, and when he left, she was two months pregnant with her son Malocchio. Once he was born, Malocchio grew quickly. Soon he rivaled his mother in personal and political power. Gabrielle underestimated him for a time and Malocchio nearly broke her. Malocchio is as manipulative as his mother, and used her own anger and grief at the death of her mother to turn Gabrielle into a shell of a woman."

Then she will wait until her puppets are fighting her minions, then turn her puppets against their friends.

							"Three hundred years ago, Treholan was one of dozens of petty nobles that tore Invidia apart with their squabbling. Treholan differed from the other nobles in his willingness to use intimidation and violence to crush his enemies. Treholan invited several dukes to attend a wedding. One of his daughters was to be wed to one of his greatest rivals' sons. Once all of the guests had arrived, Treholan bade his men attack. Every duke, duchess, and escort was slaughtered in the courtyard of the duke's castle. Treholan quickly dispatched his armies to occupy their lands, lest any distant relation stake a claim. Within a few years, Treholan sat as baron over all of Invidia. To honor his ascension to the throne, he had his great castle, Castle Loupet, built. Nearly one hundred years later, Treholan's descendents still ruled Invidia. The most recent, Baron Bakholis, was the cruelest thus far. Bakholis would ride through the countryside, choosing peasants at random to force into his harem or give to his soldiers. He taxed the peasants mercilessly, with any infraction was met with extreme punishment. Soon villages had more people with missing hands and eyes than those that did not. The only person that Bakholis showed any compassion for was his son and heir.",
							"One night Bakholis took a young woman named Marta. As he tried to flee with his prize, over a dozen men, Marta's fiance Karlus, Marta's brothers, father, and several villagers gave chase. A fight broke out between the men and Bakholis' guards. The men were angry but they were not trained warriors. They were fighting with pitchforks and wood chopping axes. Bakholis' men were trained killers, armed with real weapons and armored in maille. The fight was short. In the end, Marta's father had to sacrifice himself so Karlus could escape. All the village men were dead, and only one of Bakholis' men had been slain. As Karlus fled into the woods around his village, Bakholis ordered every member of the village to be crucified to pay for the life of his soldier. He made Marta watch as every person she had ever known was crucified that night. Then he sent her off to his harem. Karlus soon gathered a small army of oppressed villagers from other hamlets, bandits and refugees. Soon Karlus was able to overrun a few small outposts of Bakholis' troops, and turned his attention to Castle Loupet.",
							"Karlus and his army were dedicated and hated Bakholis, but they were not warriors. Castle Loupet was a formidable fortress, and Karlus couldn't breach the walls. The siege dragged on, and soon disease and famine ran rampant in Karlus' camp. As Karlus' army fell apart, Bakholis and his men attacked. Karlus' army was broken, scattered to the winds and Karlus captured. Bakholis brought Karlus and Marta to his dungeon and suspended over a pack of starving wolves. The lovers were slowly lowered into the pit while Bakholis laughed. While the wolves feasted on the lovers' legs, Marta cursed Bakholis. He would be beast outside as well as inside. She yelled the curse as the wolves devoured her legs. She screamed the curse as the wolves tore into her stomach. Choking on her own blood, she whispered the curse as the wolves ripped into her arms. Bakholis laughed the whole time. Once the wolves had had their fill, Bakholis retired to his chambers. He had a sudden headache and needed to sleep. Bakholis woke the next day covered in blood. Every servant, soldier, and advisor in the castle were but piles of bloody meat. Bakholis seized with a sudden panic, raced through the castle, calling his son's name. He barely registered that the landscape outside the window, while similar to the Invidia he ruled, had changed. He found most of his son in the throne room. His wife had tried to save the child by covering him with her own body. She had failed."

He recruited new guards and advisors after his rampage and continues to roam the countryside, kidnapping peasants at will. Some he tortures, others he kills, the rest he forces into slavery. He maintains cordial relationships with Arkandale and Gundarak, and isn't actively hated by the von Zaroviches. In the century since that dark night, Bakholis has learned to revel in his curse. Bakholis leaves before sunset on the nights of the full moon. His soldiers and advisors close the gates and seal themselves inside Castle Loupet, drinking the night away as their lord and master tears across the countryside, slaying with abandon. Bakholis has recently taken a young woman, Gabrielle Aderre, as a pleasure slave. He nearly passed her by, but something about her eyes caught his attention. In less than a day she will slay the werewolf, stabbing him in the neck with a silver dagger. After Bakholis' death, the peasants of Invidia report seeing his ghost moving amongst the trees of the forest, always pursued by a mob of angry ghosts. Most believe it's the spirits of everyone Bakholis ever killed chasing after him, hungry for revenge."

Eventually Bakholis gets tired of the game and indulges his savagery. There's very little left of his victim by the time he's done. Against creatures that can fight back, Bakholis sends in troops first. He will let the enemy tire slaughtering his followers and then move in for the kill.

It is not unheard of for an especially attractive human or elf traveling through the woods of Kartakass to have an escort of dire wolves to keep predators away. This only lasts until Harkon gets hungry, as no company is worth missing a good meal.",

Wolfweres are solitary creatures that are happy to spend their lives alone, but unfond of just his own company, Harkon tried to forge his clan into a tight knit group, but was shunned for this. After trying for years, the embers of rage finally burst in him. Harkon rampaged through the farmlands outside of Cormyr, killing and burning indiscriminately. He was giving chase to an unfortunate child through the forests asthe mists closed in. When the mists cleared, Harkon found himself in Barovia. Harkon wandered through the villages of Barovia for a few years, mostly performing, with the occasional killing spree when he finally met the vampire Strahd von Zarovich.  The lord of Barovia took exception to Harkon hunting his peasants. The battle was short and entirely one sided. Harkon fled from Strahd into the mists and found himself in Kartakass. Since that encounter, Harkon hunts any vampires he finds in his domain down without mercy. The hunt only ends when the vampires flee or are torn to pieces."

After living there for a year, he arranged to marry Estelle Weathermay, the daughter of a wealthy local, some 50 years his junior. Godefroy was a cruel and quick tempered man, given to fits of rage at his new wife for imagined slights. When his wife gave birth to a girl, Godefroy began to build an insane fantasy. His wife had cheated on him. His wife had cheated to make sure she wouldn't have a male child. The young girl, Lila, was Estelle's heart and soul. Lila was a sweet child that loved unconditionally. Godefroy stewed in his insanity for years before it finally became too much. One night his temper exploded and he beat his wife to death with his walking stick.

When Godefroy killed his wife and daughter something deep in the heart of the house awoke. The night after his wife and daughter were buried, their vengeful spirits appeared and tormented Godefroy.

Godefroy continued to spy on the living when fortune smiled on him. The mayor of Mordentshire, Daniel Foxgrove, had recently lost his wife, Alice Weathermay. Alice was one of the spirits trapped in Gryphon Manor. Now Foxgrove serves as Godefroy's spy. If Godefroy is disappointed with Foxgrove's information, Alice is punished.

His hair and moustache are still black, though peppered with enough gray to make him appear wise yet not distract from his vigour. A man in his seventies could be forgiven for not taking exercise every day, yet Tristen does so, and still comfortably wears chain mail and swings his family's ancestral sword when there is need. In times when he doesn't expect trouble, he dons comfortable loose black trousers and a bright red shirt. Malken is hunched and twisted, with heavily muscled arms that are far too long, his massive hands ending in jagged claws. Malken runs on all fours and is frighteningly fast, giggling uncontrollably as he lopes. The giggling is the last sound that his victims hear. Their last sight is his bloodshot mad eyes.",

							"Tristen's curse began with his father, Romir Hiregaard. Romir was a good ruler who was fair and, sometimes, even kind. Romir's only weakness was jealousy. If his young wife showed even polite interest in another man, he would descend into a rage. The rages became worse as time progressed. One day he found his wife in the arms of another man and killed them both. After the rage subsided, Romir realized the man was his wife's dance instructor. With her dying breath, Romir's wife cursed him. Romir would kill any woman he loved or any man that angered him. Overwhelmed with shame over what he had done, Romir killed himself. The curse passed on to the 15 year old Tristen. Tristen first learned of the curse less than a year later when he murdered the daughter of a servant family. Over the next six years, Tristen killed nine more women. To make matters worse, the more Tristen killed, the more he enjoyed it. Eventually the Dark Powers took notice and pulled Tristen into Ravenloft. When Tristen was pulled into Ravenloft, Malken manifested fully, a raging mad man that was everything Tristen despised. There is no way out for Tristen. If he is killed and Malken chooses to let him die, then the curse is transferred on to his eldest son, Yorgi. The curse that created Malken can only be defeated when the Hiregaard line ends."

He created his own thieves guild that took control of the docks. He brought in drugs and preyed on the poor and downtrodden. He took everything they had and then made them his slaves. Eventually Claude and his wererats became too bold. Several lycanthropes were caught and impaled by human authorities.

As devastation rained on his world, he was reborn as a death knight. Soth was bored for decades until he met a general that stirred his cold dead heart. He planned to kill and raise her as his undead consort. As his plan came to pass, Soth and the ghost of his treacherous seneschal, Caradoc, were pulled into Ravenloft. Soth appeared in Barovia and found the Kulchevich family, a Vistani clan. The meeting quickly became hostile. Soth slaughtered the entire family and forced the only survivor, Magda, to serve as his guide. Magda took the death knight to the lord of Barovia, Strahd von Zarovich. Soth and Strahd initially got along, but it did not last. Two creatures of immense pride, both with a desire to rule quickly became hostile to one another. Soth rampaged through Castle Ravenloft and escaped. He attemptedescape from Ravenloft through a portal that he discovered, but was deposited back in Barovia.  After Soth returned to Barovia, Strahd sought out the death knight and offered an appeasement. Strahd told Soth to travel to a neighboring domain, Gundarak and kill the son of the darklord Duke Gundar. If Soth could kill the Duke's son, a portal would open and he could leave. The death knight traveled to Gundarak and stormed the duke's castle. Gundar was forced to flee and Soth killed Gundar's vampire son. Much to Soth's dismay, nothing happened.  Soth was incensed. He returned to Castle Ravenloft and tore through an army of zombies and mercenaries that Strahd had summoned. As the last of his opponents fell, Soth saw Caradoc fleeing the castle. The death knight realized that the ghost must have been in league with Strahd all along. Caradoc fled to the border of Barovia, where he was caught by the death knight. As Soth strangled his seneschal, the mists closed in."

Selena and Kharkov soon fell in love. When Selena was at her most vulnerable, Morphayus removed the polymorph spell and returned Kharkov to his panther form. In the confusion, Kharkov tore Selena to shreds with his claws before passing out. When Kharkov woke up, he had returned to his human form. Kharkov was convinced Morphayus was going to use him as a sleeper agent against all of his enemies. Kharkov would fight a war in the shadows, taking on increasingly more dangerous foes until Kharkov was slain.",

Perhaps Kharkov had already started to draw power from Ravenloft, but he found he could transform from human to panther form at will. Kharkov found killing easy and his bestial side, what Kharkov would come to call the \"Beast.\" Kharkov didn't want to be used as someone else's private murderer, but had no problems killing for his own pleasure. After a few years he was recruited into the Kargat, Darkon's secret police. Kharkov served in the Kargat for 20 years, becoming a vampire in the process, before fleeing into the mists when his vampire master was slain. Kharkov wandered the mists for a time. Even Kharkov is unsure which domain he was in when he ran into Morphayus. Kharkov willingly became the Beast when he saw Morphayus, shredding him and the corpse.

He wandered Ravenloft for years until he was captured by a group of shepherds while slaughtering their sheep. Alfred was rescued by a Vistani tribe. The Vistani offered to set Alfred free if he swore he would never attack one of them again. Alfred agreed. Once he was free, he immediately tried to kill the Vistani's leader.

A hermit that lived on the north side of the lake gained the Lady's attention, and they fell in love. Soon the Lady and the hermit were expecting their first child, a girl.",
							"As the Lady drew close to her time to give birth, an evil fey cornered the hermit. The fey, a hag of prodigious power and vicious temper, demanded the hermit help her with her plans to gain magic and power. The hermit refused.",
							"In a rage, the fey turned the hermit into an avanc, but left his soul and mind untouched. The hermit was trapped in the body of a monster, and soon the local townspeople were terrified of the beast.",
							"The tales of a monster in the lake drew the attention of Ione Demnach, a paladin and member of the famed Demnach clan, monster hunters one and all. The Demnach clan had a keep on the island in the middle of the lake. They had been prosperous once, but had started to dwindle. Ione trapped the avanc in shallow water and slew the hermit.",
							"The Lady was beside herself with rage. She left her lake and searched for creatures that could give her revenge. She found a coven of hags in the domain of Tepest and sung her bitter song. The hags offered the Lady a deal. Her daughter would grow up and die in a fraction of the time a mortal normally received, but she would be a sorceress of incredible power. The Lady agreed without hesitation.",
							"The Lady's daughter, Katherine, was born a few days later and grew to beautiful adulthood in  afew years. The Lady sent Katherine to seduce Ione, who rapidly fell victim to Katherine's beguiling spells. Ione's wife discovered the tryst and fled to the lakeshore. There the broken hearted woman wept. She was answered by a beautiful song. The wife found a sirine, the Lady, singing to her about the beauty of the Fae Realm and the treachery of men. The sirine offered to take Ione's wife away from all the pain and suffering. Ione's wife accepted and took the Lady's offered hand. The woman's body was found the next day.",
							"Katherine soon gave birth to Ione's son, a caliban with fish features, thick scales, and arms strong enough to uproot trees. For one year, the Lady fed Ione's son, whom she called Madchen, nothing but hate.",
							"After the year had passed the Lady sent Katherine and her son back to Demnach island to end the clan. Katherine fell to the arrows of the guards, but Madchen tore the gate from its hinges and slaughtered everyone inside the keep.",
							"While dueling Ione, the last of the keep's defenders, Madchen was slain and Ione was mortally wounded. The Lady took her chance, she approached Ione with a vial of magical poison. The poison would never let Ione die, but would also never let him heal. Ione would be in pain for all eternity.",
							"As Ione drank the potion, the Lady sang of her victory. She closed her eyes to savor the moment, and when she opened them, everything had changed. Demnach Keep was in ruins and Ione was a brittle skeleton. Something had robbed her of her revenge and trapped her on her island."

The poor minion is quickly dragged away to Azalin's laboratory. Azalin wore a heavy iron crown mounted with a spike until the events of the Requiem.

							"Firan Zal'honan was the second son of Duke Tiralitan Zal'honan, a minor noble in a forgotten world. At birth his prospects were bleak, Firan couldn't inherit land and he did not have the strength of arms to join a company of mercenaries. The duchy was small and surrounded by hostile tribes of humanoids. The young noble respected his father and older brother, Ranald, but had no love for them. The only person Firan developed any connection for was his younger brother Irik. Irik was kind and slow to anger. He was the only person who could calm Firan's temper when the young noble lost control. Firan's father hated magic in any form and forbade it in his lands. At first Firan respected his father's rules and avoided magic, but as he grew Firan realized magic offered him what nothing else could, control. The discipline necessary to study the arcane arts gave Azalin control over himself and the spells he studied gave him control over others. As Firan grew in ability he realized another desire magic could achieve. Power.",
							"Firan soon confided in Irik about his arcane pursuits, the pair soon joining together in studying under the wizard Quantarius. Quantarius was a powerful wizard who kept to the shadows to avoid the wrath of the boy's father. Firan mastered magic quickly, but soon his grasp exceeded even his considerable reach. When he was 15, Firan and Irik tried to summon a fiend. The fiend quickly overpowered both of the young mages and went on a rampage. Quantarius was able to slay the fiend, but not before Irik lost his life. Quantarius had saved the duchy, but was outed as a mage, and banished. Firan chose to follow Quantarius into exile and continue his studies.",
							"Over time, Firan mastered powerful magic. He could drain the vitality of others to extend his life and heal his wounds. He could steal spells from the minds of other mages and learn them in an instant. Firan studied dark magic and soon moved beyond what Quantarius was willing to teach him. When Firan studied on his own he learned even faster.",
							"During his exile, Tiralitan died, and Ranald inherited the duchy. Under Ranald's rule his people suffered. Ranald was a harsh and petty tyrant who drank and whored the treasury to nothing. The people suffered, both from Ranald's drinking and from the raids of the surrounding tribes. Constant drinking and feasting took its toll on Ranald and within a few years he passed. Firan returned from exile as an Azal'Lan, a Wizard King.",
							"Azal'Lan was a harsh but fair ruler. Magic was embraced and Azal'Lan conducted a series of brutal mercenary campaigns against the neighboring tribes. His duchy became powerful militarily and economically. His people procured, as long as they obeyed. Anyone who broke the law was severely punished, even Azal'Lan's own son, Irik. Irik, like his namesake, was a kind soul. When Azal'Lan imprisoned several political prisoners Irik led a doomed attempt to free them. Irik was tried for treason and found guilty by his own father. While Irik's conspirators and the prisoners were executed by a headsman, Azal'Lan beheaded Irik himself. After the death of his son Azal'Lan became obsessed with immortality and restoring his son to life. He would race toward any hint of new magic to add to his immense library. It was a shock when the secret to lichdom was offered to Azal'Lan by a shadowy figure in his own lab. Azal'Lan was wary, but could not resist the power undeath offered. After his apotheosis, Azal'Lan ruled for decades, greatly expanding his territory and power. Despite the decades Azal'Lan still desired to resurrect his son. One day a traveller told the lich king of a new magic that would bring the dead to life without the interference of the gods. Azal'Lan took a small retinue of guards and set off after the rumors. Once outside of his duchy Azal'Lan and his guards were ambushed by a combined force of tribal warriors and mercenaries. Azal'Lan's guards were slaughtered but the lich was more than a match for his assailants. He laughed as he drained their lives away, dissolved their bones, and shattered their minds. As the last tribeman died the mist came for Azal'Lan.",
							"When the mists cleared Azal'Lan was in Barovia. The first person he met mispronounced his title as Azalin. It was a name Azal'Lan quickly adopted in his new home. Azalin traveled for a time and eventually found Strahd von Zarovich, the lord of Barovia and the only creature in Barovia that Azalin could consider an equal. Even then Azalin knew he could kill Strahd if he so wished. Azalin stayed at Castle Ravenloft for years. He quickly learned about his prison and began to experiment with the nature of the demiplane and the Dark Powers. One of his earliest experiments involved creating the arcane machine, the Apparatus, that opened a portal to Mordent and in the chaos that followed dragged the entire country through to become a new dark domain. After the experiment failed, relations between Strahd and Azalin, already strained, reached a breaking point. Azalin knew he could destroy Strahd, but was concerned Barovia would dissolve into the mists with the death of its lord. Because Mordent had been pulled into the mists and now lay outside of Barovia's borders, Azalin deduced that new countries may exist or be created in the mists. Azalin left Castle Ravenloft and walked into the mists. He was gifted the realm of Darkon. For a time after the creation of Darkon, Azalin was split into two beings. Firan was a mage who couldn't remember anything about himself. Firan helped those in need, but felt pulled to Castle Avernus. There Firan fought and defeated a powerful undead entity called Daraculas. When Daraculas was slain, its undead essence merged with Firan and Azalin was reborn. At first Azalin raged against the Dark Powers and swore to break free of their control and get his revenge. After some time and research, Azalin has come to believe that the Dark Powers had granted him a chance as Firan to escape Ravenloft and return home. Azalin established his rule at Castle Avernus, but the nearby city of Il Aluk became the political and economic center of Darkon. While exploring the castle, Azalin found the crypt of his son, Irik in the catacombs beneath the castle.",
							"Azalin himself is unsure, but at some point after he was taken by the mists, he lost the ability to learn new magic. Azalin remembers creating new types of golems and researching the complicated magical rituals for his first attempt to breach Ravenloft. He also remembers teaching Strahd the spells needed to activate the Apparatus. Azalin's memory changes every time he tries to remember, and interrupting one of these reveries is a sure way to die a painful death.",
							"Azalin quickly established his rule in Darkon. He assembled the Kargat, a secret police of human informants, werewolves, and vampires, charged with crushing dissent and ferreting out spies. Over the years the Kargat expanded their activities to carry Azalin's will to other domains as spies and assassins.",
							"Azalin continued his research into the nature of the demiplane of dread. He tried to escape several times, all of which have failed. One such attempt, now called the Grand Conjunction, nearly tore the demiplane apart and reordered the domains that were trapped. His most recent attempt, the Requiem, drained the life force of an entire city, Il Aluk, and created a new dark lord, Death. The events of the Requiem were supposed to grant Azalin enough energy that he could break free of his corporeal body and escape Ravenloft. Instead Azalin's body was blasted apart and his mind scattered across Darkon. Azalin struggled to reassemble his mind for five years. Finally Azalin could possess the body of his son and be reborn."

Azalin retains his abilities to control any undead in Darkon, even intelligent undead. Neither of these abilities extends to creatures in Il Aluk, which causes Azalin considerable alarm Azalin's new experiments have moved beyond escaping Ravenloft.

Despite its madeup origin, clerics and paladins of The Eternal Order nevertheless receive divine powers, and their healing evocation spells which normally exclude undead may heal them for half effectiveness when cast using a spell slot at least one higher than base level. Most ranking clergy are simply another arm of Azalin's intelligence and state control apparatus and have little faith, but some sects are truly faithful and call upon the powers of the dead to protect the living, investigate cold cases, protect tombs, judge and aid the undead with valid grievances against the living, and put to rest those they cannot help. Players who want to create a character with a background in The Eternal Order should choose any non-chaotic alignment, but barbarians following the Path of the Ancestral Guardians are always welcome in the Order's ranks."

If a creature attempts to fly over the horde they are forced down to the ground by an invisible force. Any attempt to teleport past the horde partially fails. The creature is instead teleported into the middle of the undead horde. Undead near the border inerrantly know the location of creatures Azalin does not want to leave Darkon, and the undead relentlessly assemble and attack in greater and greater numbers until the targets turn back from the border -- in which case they are harried no further. Azalin himself doesn't automatically learn about attempted escapes of creatures he forbade from leaving Darkon, but he is likely to receive reports of an unexplained mass rising of undead and put two-and-two together."

Vlad's history seems to begin when he became a mercenary for the followers of the cruel god, Hith. Vlad's ruthless nature and obvious intelligence served him well as a mercenary, and soon his coffers were overflowing with gold and his services in demand all across the continent. Despite this, Vlad felt empty. His clients fought for his services and paid him well, but they looked down on him as little more than a rabid dog. This scorn drove Vlad to vent his fury on his vic-tims, engaging in ever greater acts of cruelty and tor-ture. After decades of bathing in the blood of innocents, he was pulled into Ravenloft by the Dark Powers. Af-ter one particularly long night of torture and mutilation, Vlad and his men found themselves in Darkon, the realm of Azalin the lich.",

As Vlad's troops were slain by hordes of undead, they rose as zombies and joined the endless ranks of the enemy. Vlad's considerable experience and tactical brilliance accounted for nothing and his troops fell before the re-lentless attacks of the undead. Before he knew what had happened, he was pushed back into the mists sur-rounding Darkon."

Vlad has attempted to invade Darkon no fewer than five times over the decades and been repulsed with heavy losses every time. Azalin hasn't even bothered to send an envoy demanding an end to the attacks or asking for peace. It seems no matter what Vlad does, Azalin hasn't even noticed him. Vlad takes this out on the people of his domain. He demands at least one execution a day, and eats his dinner while watching his victim being tortured to death. On special occa-sions Vlad will have as many as forty people execut-ed. His favorite method is impalement, but Vlad is al-ways on the lookout for fascinating new ways to slowly and painfully kill. Falkovnia is the breadbasket of the Domains of Dread, and Vlad could starve the armies of his neighbors by the simple act of just not sending them grain.

					"Tristessa is a tall, slender shadow elf with onyx black skin and white hair that hangs down to her waist. Her hair constantly shifts around her as if blown in a vio-lent storm, while her eyes are obsidian orbs. Tristes-sa hovers a few inches above the ground, and on the rare occasion the moon hangs over the sky of Keen-ing, anyone unfortunate enough to meet her can see through her. Like all banshees, Tristessa has a deadly wail. Her mouth opens far larger than should be possi-ble as she wails, the sound of an endless well of suffer-ing and loss. Those fortunate enough to meet her and survive will hear her wail in their nightmares for years to come. Most take a sharp needle to their ears, pray-ing it makes the wailing stop. It never does. Tristessa is often mistaken for a drow, but is a shadow fey from a distant world, nearly forgotten by modern scholars. Her people are ancient and powerful, but find the sun's rays deadly.",

							"Tristessa was born in the domain of Arak, a subterranean kingdom of shadow fey. A small but vibrant human kingdom lay above Arak in the sur-face lands. The Arakans enjoyed toying with the hu-mans, pitting them against each other in endless cruel schemes. Tristessa was the sister of the domain's king, Loht. Things changed when three outsiders entered Arak. The outsiders, drow elves, looked similar to the shadow fey and were comfortable in the cold lightless tunnels the fey called home. Tristessa, Loht, and the shadow fey welcomed the drow into their kingdom, and the three, lost and harried on the surface because of their appearance and obvious inhuman blood, readily accepted. The drow brought their faith in their venom-ous spider queen, Lolth, with them. The drow quickly be-gan to convert shadow fey to the worship of Lolth, start-ing the Church of the Spider Queen. In a few months hundreds of shadow fey had converted to the worship of their dark queen. The shadow fey that converted to the worship of Lolth began to resemble the drow that led the church, their skin often becoming purple or jet black, and they covered themselves in stylized web and spider tattoos. Loht, sensing a threat to his pow-er and seeing the danger of the growing power of the church, decided to act, but the magic of the shadow fey stayed his hand. The oldest law of Arak was called the Law, and Arak and it was sealed with ancient magic.",
							"This law forbade any shadow fey from directly slaying another shadow fey. Because of the Law, the politics and fighting of the shadow fey was always subtle. The fey rarely acted directly against each other, working through hired agents and glamoured minions. Although Loht could not move directly against the shadow fey who had fallen to the Church of the Spider Queen, he was free to move against the drow, who were quickly slain. Tristessa took control of the cult and the war be-came a bitter family feud. For decades the war raged in silence in the kingdom of Arak. Despite her best ef-forts, Tristessa was slowly losing. She begged Lolth for aid, but the Spider Queen was neither willing nor able to help. As the noose tightened around Tristessa and her remaining followers, Lolth sent Tristessa a miracle. Tristessa gave birth to a baby girl with spider legs. Her followers demanded to know who the father was, the doctrines of the Church of the Spider Queen required the father to be sacrificed to Lolth. Tristessa insisted there was no father and the baby was a gift from Lolth. The cult shattered and Loht was finally able to wipe the Church of the Spider Queen from his kingdom. After de-cades of bitter warfare, Loht had nothing but contempt for his sister. So great was his hatred, he broke the Law of Arak and staked Tristessa and her child out on the slopes of Mount Lament, so they would be turned to ash by the morning sun. As the sun scorched the flesh from her bones and her baby wailed in agony, Tristes-sa brought down a powerful curse on the kingdom of Arak. A sandstorm descended on the surface kingdom for over a year. When it finally abated, the kingdom, every human, animal, and building was gone, as if they never existed. The Arakans were largely unharmed, but the surface had become a barren wasteland. On the slopes of Mount Lament, a figure stirred. Although she had been burnt by the hated sun and lay inside a terrible sandstorm for a year, Tristessa still moved. Her body was gone and only her hate-filled psychotic spirit remained. In death, she had become a banshee, and the mountain where she had died became her domain. To her horror, Tristessa's child was missing. There was nor sign of the child or her body. Tristessa scoured the mountain, but to no avail. Her cries of pain and rage echoed from the slopes of Mount Lament."

Azalin sought to break his curse by using a wish to cause several women around Darkon to fall pregnant with his clones. Most of the clones died in the womb, but the few that survived, the lich watched. Azalin used magic to make sure that his clones studied the arcane arts and were fanatically loy-al to the lich lord. Once the clones had spent a few de-cades mastering magic, Azalin planned on draining the knowledge from their minds. If Azalin retained what the clones had learned, he would have found a way around the horrible curse the Dark Powers had placed on him. Although Azalin was able to drain several of his clones, the knowledge they had gained fled Azalin's mind as fast as he learned it. Azalin was determined to salvage something out of the experiment, and placed each of his clones into positions of power. Lowellyn Dachine was unusual for a high-ranking member of the Kargat. He was a human while most high ranking members were vampires, or rarely werewolves. Lowellyn was also a cleric in the Eternal Order, giving him powerful positions in the secret police and state religion of Dar-kon. Because of his powerful will and complete loyalty, Azalin chose Lowellyn to test the infernal machine, the prototype for the Doomsday Device. The Doomsday Device was Azalin's latest attempt to escape the Demi-plane of Dread. The infernal machine was designed to steal the life force of dozens and channel them into the creature inside the infernal machine. The machine worked perfectly, transforming Lowellyn from a human into something more. Lowellyn shed his human name and became Death. Death was a powerful elemental, composed entirely of negative energy. The experience shattered Lowellyn's sanity and he began to believe he was the embodiment of death itself. Azalin found the new creature fascinating and moved ahead with his plans for the Doomsday Device, which was the infernal machine on a grand scale. Death was chased from the Eternal Order's temple by adventurers soon after and fled into the mists. Death emerged from the mists in Il Aluk and began helping Azalin with the final preparations for Doomsday Device. When the device was activated, Azalin disappeared and Il Aluk became Death's domain. Il Aluk became Necropolis, the city of the dead. All of its inhabitants had been slain by the Doomsday Device and reanimated by the necrotic energy rampaging through the city. Death is the most powerful creature in Necropolis, and can control any of the undead within its borders, but cannot move beyond the Shroud that surrounds Necropolis. Death worked to stop the return of Azalin, unsure of what would hap-pen if the darklord returned. Death's agents were frus-trated when after five years Azalin returned."

When asked a riddle in return, the hag rarely offers a response it is unsure of, and instead remains {@condition stunned} for a single turn or until it can think of an answer. It may offer a wrong answer, but it may never admit it, and the match will continue until it misses several more and becomes disgruntled. (Posing riddles that are difficult can be just as dangerous as posing none.) If the opponent is clever and lucky, the match will last until sunrise, when the hag trundles away to avoid the light. For a stranger or new opponent, the chance this riddle match will occur at all is 75%. But if the hag knows the victim and has been aggravated by him for a while, this is far less likely, only 25%."

In theory, this can continue until the opponent misses an answer (and is eaten). The hags may pose virtually any riddle, but here are two of their favorites: 1) What walks on four legs when young, two when mature, and three when old? (A man; the third leg is a cane.); 2) Blue mirror of midnight's soul, sometimes half but always whole. (The moon). When asked a riddle in return, the hag rarely offers a response it is unsure of, and instead remains {@condition stunned} for a single turn or until it can think of an answer. It may offer a wrong answer, but it may never admit it, and the match will continue until it misses several more and becomes disgruntled. (Posing riddles that are difficult can be just as dangerous as posing none.) If the opponent is clever and lucky, the match will last until sunrise, when the hag trundles away to avoid the light. For a stranger or new opponent, the chance this riddle match will occur at all is 75%. But if the hag knows the victim and has been aggravated by him for a while, this is far less likely, only 25%."

Leticia and Lorinda entertained the traveller while Laveeda cooked a wonderful meal. Laveeda could mask any flavor and the stranger never tasted the poison that killed him. The sisters took care of the body quickly. Laveeda cooked the meat into stew for Holger and her brothers. Leticia polished his bones and turned them into jewelry. Lorinda tanned the skin into wonderful new vests for her father and brothers. The sisters had found a way to get the gold they needed, while taking a small amount of revenge on Holger and their broth-ers. They continued to murder innocent strangers for years, amassing a vast fortune buried in the woods. One day an absolutely beautiful man appeared at the gates to the farmhouse. He was witty, intelligent, and told the sisters exactly what they wanted to hear. The three sisters fought for the man's affections, shower-ing him with gold and gifts. The man spent the money on a lavish lifestyle, and disappeared as soon as the money was gone. The sisters realized they had been played and were furious. They tracked him down and took their time cutting him to ribbons. The sisters were broke and hungry. They had no food and no way to get any, so they turned to the only meat they had on hand. As they devoured the dandy, the Mists clouded in. When the Mists cleared, the sisters had changed. They were hags now and revelled in their new power and abilities."

In theory, this can continue until the opponent misses an answer (and is eaten). The hags may pose virtually any riddle, but here are two of their favorites: 1) What walks on four legs when young, two when mature, and three when old? (A man; the third leg is a cane.); 2) Blue mirror of midnight's soul, sometimes half but always whole. (The moon). When asked a riddle in return, the hag rarely offers a response it is unsure of, and instead remains {@condition stunned} for a single turn or until it can think of an answer. It may offer a wrong answer, but it may never admit it, and the match will continue until it misses several more and becomes disgruntled. (Posing riddles that are difficult can be just as dangerous as posing none.) If the opponent is clever and lucky, the match will last until sunrise, when the hag trundles away to avoid the light. For a stranger or new opponent, the chance this riddle match will occur at all is 75%. But if the hag knows the victim and has been aggravated by him for a while, this is far less likely, only 25%."

They were her beautiful baby girls and Rudella would die before she let any harm come to them. Rudella named them Laveeda, Leticia, and Lorinda.",

Lorinda could work with any materi-al, animal skins, wool, even silk when she could find some. The local villagers even became suspicious of Holger and his sons. How could a poor farmer afford such elegant clothing? Lorinda refused any commissions, no matter the cost. She had seen the greedy look in her father's eyes as he took her sister's money. Lorinda would be damned before she would become a slave for her father.",

The stranger had gold and was will-ing to pay gold for any food the sisters could spare. A silent agreement was reached in an instant. Leticia and Lorinda entertained the traveller while Laveeda cooked a wonderful meal. Laveeda could mask any flavor and the stranger never tasted the poison that killed him. The sisters took care of the body quickly. Laveeda cooked the meat into stew for Holger and her brothers. Leticia polished his bones and turned them into jewelry. Lorinda tanned the skin into wonderful new vests for her father and brothers. The sisters had found a way to get the gold they needed, while taking a small amount of revenge on Holger and their broth-ers. They continued to murder innocent strangers for years, amassing a vast fortune buried in the woods. One day an absolutely beautiful man appeared at the gates to the farmhouse. He was witty, intelligent, and told the sisters exactly what they wanted to hear. The three sisters fought for the man's affections, shower-ing him with gold and gifts. The man spent the money on a lavish lifestyle, and disappeared as soon as the money was gone. The sisters realized they had been played and were furious. They tracked him down and took their time cutting him to ribbons. The sisters were broke and hungry. They had no food and no way to get any, so they turned to the only meat they had on hand. As they devoured the dandy, the Mists clouded in. When the Mists cleared, the sisters had changed. They were hags now and revelled in their new power and abilities."

							"Before he was brought into the Demiplane of Dread, Bluebeard would have considered his current physical appearance to be a gift from the gods. Bluebeard was, to say in no uncertain terms, hideous. His skin was red and blotchy, his lips were swollen and a disturbing shade of purple. If Bluebeard didn't con-centrate, his tongue would protrude from his mouth. His beard was cobalt blue and hung in thick braids to his chest. He looked for all the world like a corpse. De-spite this, Bluebeard was very popular with the women of his small kingdom, Blaustein. Undeniably charming, Bluebeard always had a humorous story or ribald joke at the ready. It didn't hurt that he was fabulously wealthy, owning gold and silver mines that he used to fund successful trading ventures all over the world. His castle was large and well appointed, with rarities such as mirrors and gear driven clocks in every room. Bluebeard was often away on business ventures that took him far from Castle Bluebeard and Blaustein, but he would return as soon as possible. The people of Blaustein considered Bluebeard a just lord, but whispered about his great tragedy. They didn't whisper about his looks, which you grew accustomed to after a while, but his wives. By the time Bluebeard was in his early twenties he had been married three times. Each time he had only been married for a few months be-fore his wife met a tragic end. The people of Blaustein whispered that Castle Bluebeard was haunted, that the spirit of either Bluebeard's first wife, or his long dead mother, haunted the castle and killed the wives when they were alone. Others thought the castle itself was evil and devoured the young women. The truth was far darker. Bluebeard's fourth wife was Marcella, a beau-tiful and cunning young woman. Marcella was as witty as her new husband, and helped him make several shrewd business decisions soon after they were mar-ried. She also learned some important facts about her husband. Bluebeard treated his opinions like facts and hated it when someone disagreed with him. Even rea-soned and well thought arguments that he disagreed with would be met with disdain and a refusal to accept that he could be wrong. Marcella soon learned her life with Bluebeard would be much happier if she agreed with her husband, no matter what she actually thought. It didn't hurt that Bluebeard showered his new bride with gifts when she agreed with him.",
							"A month after their wedding, Bluebeard left to attend to business affairs in a neighboring kingdom. Before he left, Bluebeard gave his wife a large ring of keys. He told her that the keys would open every room in the castle, and she was free to explore as long as she followed one rule. Bluebeard held up a small golden key and told Marcella that it unlocked the room at the top of the tallest tower in the castle. Marcella was not to enter that room under any circumstances. To do so would invite disaster for her and their marriage. She agreed and Bluebeard left the next day. For a month she explored the castle, and the room at the top of the tower was never far from her mind. Twice she placed the key in the lock but lost her nerve at the last second. Finally after a few months of wondering, Marcella couldn't stand it any more. She stole up to the room and, before she could think twice, placed the key in the lock and opened the door.",
							"The first thing that told her what a terrible mistake she had made was the smell. The room was dark, and reeked of carrion and stale blood. When her eyes ad-justed to the darkness, Marcella shrieked in horror. Bluebeard's three past wives were in the small room. They had been hung from hooks and their throats had been slit. The cuts were so deep that the spine of one of the wives had been gouged and nicked by the blade.",
							"Marcella slammed the door and ran screaming back to her chambers. Once she returned to her room she realized, much to her renewed horror, that the lit-tle golden key had turned blood red. Marcella stared at the key, realizing it spelled her doom, when she heard her husband's voice behind her demanding to know what she had done. Bluebeard dragged his wife through the castle, bemoaning his fate. Marcella had been his favorite, but now she couldn't be trusted. He hauled her up the stairs and they disappeared into the room. No one knows how many wives Bluebeard had before he was claimed by the mists, although Blue-beard himself thinks he may now be on his eighth wife."

The change was gradual at first, but af-ter the first 50 years Bluebeard realized his skin had cleared and his lips were no longer purple. The change seems to have sped up in the last decade or so, and Bluebeard checks his reflection eagerly every day.",
							"Bluebeard still longs to marry, but will never marry a woman from Blaustein. Whenever he looks at a woman from his country, he sees one of the faces of his dead wives smiling back at him. Because of this, Bluebeard looks for wives from outside Blaustein. His people know of his preferences and look for a suitable bride from anyone drawn into his domain by the mists. His last wife was an outlander named Lorel that came into Blaustein seeking him. Bluebeard gladly took her in, became her teacher, and in time her husband. Sad-ly Lorel was killed under mysterious circumstances but a month after the wedding.",

Like all her kind, Althea's body is that of a thin, even shapely human woman. Her face is awful, having the over-all highlights of a human face, coupled with the scales and surface of a reptile.

During the night something had turned the guard to stone. What's more, as they walked that day, they all caught glimpses of some dark creature following them. Soon, one by one, the men were disappearing. After a few hours only Weh-ner was left. He tied a blindfold around his eyes and tried to meet his fate bravely. To his shock the crea-ture didn't charge him, but instead approached him slowly, entreating him to stay, to enjoy her wealth and companionship. Her voice was lovely, but offset by the sibilant hissing of serpents. Wehner lashed out and felt his blade connect. The creature screamed and ripped off Wehner's blindfold. Something spat venom in his eyes, burning them in the sockets. Weh-ner turned and ran. He miraculously made his way out of the maze and back to his ship. The remainder of his crew took him back to Lamordia. He has since vanished without a trace."

							"Heinfroth's obsession with madness began when he was a boy growing up in the domain of Gundarak before the Grand Conjunction. His mother was a serious, driven woman that was the matriarch of a small but prosperous clan of textile merchants. When Heinfroth was seven, she was suddenly struck with a violent disease that rapidly eroded her ability to rea-son. After a few weeks she could no longer recognize her only son. After a month she could not speak more than two words at a time and had trouble remembering basic concepts. By six months she had to be bound to keep herself and others safe. She died screaming in fear and rage a few days later. In six months the dis-ease had torn her mind apart, then taken her life.",
							"After her funeral, Heinfroth began to research his ancestry. He found that every single one of his relatives on his mother's side had died of the same disease, most before the age of thirty. The disease always worked the same way, their minds were rapidly torn apart by a mysterious disease, then death.",
							"Heinfroth was determined that he would not suffer the same fate. He began to kidnap anyone that wouldn't be missed and experiment on them. He would break the mind of his victims through torture and manipulation, then try to heal them of the afflictions he caused.",
							"Within a few years Heinfroth was no closer to curing the madness that had taken his mother, but was a master at psychologically damaging innocent people. What's more he found he enjoyed tearing apart the minds of his victims, and had a natural affinity for it. His half hearted attempts at curing the madness he caused were no match for the zeal he had in inflicting it on his victims.",
							"After a few years of torturing vagabonds and transients, Heinfroth finally had a breakthrough. He used long syringes to take spinal fluid out of healthy victims and injected it directly into the spine and skulls of suf-fering patients. To his surprise, the patients showed some improvement.",
							"Using his new techniques, Heinfroth was accepted to study at the Asylum for the Mentally Disturbed. The asylum provided the perfect cover for Heinfroth's work. Hienfroth began to refine his technique and soon was a master at draining every last drop of spinal fluid. It killed his victims, but sacrifices in the name of science were acceptable losses for him.",
							"By the time he was twenty eight, Heinfroth was recognized as the premier medical doctor in all of Gundarak. It was just after that birthday that Heinfroth noticed the tremors for the first time. His hands began to shake, ever so slightly. Then he began to forget things. Small things at first, but soon he was forgetting the names of people and places he had known all his life. The mad-ness had him in its grasp and it was only a matter of time before he fully succumbed.",
							"Heinfroth found a woman near his home in the prime of health and quickly spirited her away. He bound her and drained every last ounce of spinal fluid from her, then injected it directly into his brain. Unfortunately for Heinfroth, Duke Gundar, a powerful vampire and lord of Gundarak had chosen the woman to be his next vampire bride. Her spinal fluid, steeped in the life drain-ing energies that were the result of a feeding vampire, mixed with his to create a new and powerful undead. The cerebral vampire is a type of undead that must drain its victims of spinal fluid rather than blood. Their fangs are longer and stronger than a traditional vampire, perfectly formed to slip in between vertebrae or puncture the skull.",
							"Duke Gundar was furious with Heinfroth and nearly killed him. The only thing that saved his life was his total obedience to Duke Gundar and his weakness versus the Duke's mind dominating gaze. Gundar forced the doctor to move into his castle and serve as his full time physician.",
							"After years of dominating Heinfroth, Gundar conceived a plan to make the doctor the lord of neighboring Kar-takass, the domain of Harkon Lukas. Gundar tried to manipulate a party of adventurers into killing Harkon, but the wolfwere proved too canny a foe. The adven-turers uncovered the plot and returned to Gundarak, seeking revenge. Duke Gundar sought to lure them into a trap by using himself as bait. Gundar thought of his control over Heinfroth to ensure he would release the duke from his cage and Gundar could slaughter the fools at will.",
							"Much to the dismay of Gundar, Heinfroth was finally able to resist the mental domination of Duke Gundar. The adventurers wasted little time in staking the duke and fleeing the domain.",
							"With the death of Duke Gundar, Heinfroth assumed control of the domain. He moved back to the asylum to continue his research and ignored the rest of Gundarak. When the Grand Conjunction shattered Ravenloft, Gundarak was dissolved and the asylum became its own domain in the Core.",
							"Originally Dominia was small, just the asylum and its grounds, but as Heinfroth began to give into his sadism and cruelly experimenting on his victims, Dominia has slowly expanded."

Trotting out these poor victims has con-vinced the people of Dominia that Heinfroth is a living saint, living his life to bring succor to the mentally ill.

							"Centuries ago, Marquis Stezen d'Polarno was a vassal to the powerful King Oderic IX on a for-gotten world far from the Demiplane of Dread. Stezen's father was a drunk who had squandered most of the family fortune on drink and disreputable company, but the young marquis was determined to erase this stain from his family's honor. Stezen's lust for life and mag-netic personality made him tremendously popular with the commoners in Oderic's realm and his quick wit and deadly rapier made him popular with the courtesans of Oderic's court as well. Oderic had been king for a long time, and knew an ambitious noble with designs on his throne when he saw one. It was only a matter of time before the old king and the young noble would decide the fate of the kingdom.",
							"During a particularly harsh winter, Stezen thought he saw his chance. One of his spies in the king's inner circle told the marquis about Oderic's huge grain stores held under the capital city. Even better, the spy had procured a map. The common people were starving in their homes and rebellion hung heavy in the air.",
							"Stezen laid his plans carefully. He gathered his allies in the capital and then leaked the map to the common-ers of the capital. The city was rocked by riots, urged on by Stezen and his followers. Stezen had several prominent nobles dragged into the streets to be torn to pieces by the howling crowd. Commoners and mer-chants that had slighted the vain marquis were given to the howling mob's tender mercies as well. Stezen rode a wave of blood to the very gates of Oderic's palace. Then it all went wrong.",
							"Oderic had secretly brought an army into the capital. Hundreds of loyal knights, thousands of pikemen and archers flooded the streets. The commoners fled for their lives, leaving Stezen and his noble followers to their fate. The son of the nobles Stezen had fed to the vicious crowd joined the fray searching for the treach-erous marquis.",
							"In a matter of hours it was all over. Oderic had Stezen's noble followers beheaded and their heads mounted on pikes. Grain was taken from the massive underground store houses and distributed to the people to quiet their stomachs. Unfortunately for Oderic, Stezen presented a problem. His grip on the common man was far too tight to make beheading safe, so Stezen was left to rot in the dungeons beneath Oderic's castle.",
							"Eventually one of Oderic's mistresses, a powerful spellcaster, came upon a solution. She painted a beau-tiful portrait of Stezen, and cast a complicated variant of the trap the soul spell. The spell only trapped part of Stezen's soul in the painting, leaving the marquis a bitter shell of what he was. Stezen's temper became short and his mood was foul. There was an undeniable wrongness about him and even the rats of the dungeon fled his presence. When Oderic saw what was left of his rival, he gleefully released him.",
							"Stezen became a sullen drunk, his lack of a soul and bitter demeanor made him an outcast. Stezen was ig-nored and forgotten. Only Oderic was ever happy to see the broken nobleman, and let the marquis have room in his castle. The king's overconfidence would prove his undoing.",
							"After a year of living as a bitter wretch, Stezen seized upon a desperate plan. Stezen waited until the feast that marked his defeat a year before. To show his pen-ance Stezen served the king himself. Oderic gleefully allowed the disgraced marquis to serve him. After the first bite, Oderic's throat closed and his face turned a disgusting purple. Stezen leaned forward and drank in Oderic's final moments with glee. As the guards reached for Stezen, a thick mist covered the castle. When it cleared, Stezen was gone.",
							"Stezen found himself in his manor house, a servant goal offering him a glass of his family's wine. The por-trait that Oderic's mistress had painted of him hung in the middle of the grand ballroom. The servant girl stopped to look at the painting just as Stezen wished he could drain her soul to replace his own.",
							"The painting flashed red and the servant girl dropped to the ground, dead. Stezen felt a surge of vitality and joy for life. In that instant he knew what the painting could do and how often it would work. Stezen embraced his new life and began planning his first ball."

							"The marquis is largely apathetic toward Ghastria and his subjects. As long as the crops are brought in on time and the taxes are paid, Stezen doesn't care about his domain. Ghastria is a small do-main, and Stezen's magnetic personality (when rejuve-nated) or his small cadre of guards (when he is not) are more than enough to keep the peasants in line.",
							"Only once a season is Stezen permitted to throw a grand ball at his country estate. He never invites the peasants of Ghastria, the smell would be intolerable, and someone has to work the fields, but makes sure to invite every stranger within his domain. The marquis will appear at the ball around midnight, and invite ev-eryone to gaze upon the portrait of himself that hangs in the middle of the grand ballroom. With an act of will, Stezen can drain the souls of up to fifty people and have them transferred to himself, revitalizing himself for an hour for each soul consumed. The marquis has been known to secret away particularly beautiful wom-en to a side room before draining the souls of his party guests.",
							"The painting itself is huge and seems impervious to harm. It cannot be burned or cut, and any attempt to paint over it fades away, leaving no trace of paint be-hind. Furthermore Stezen appears exactly as he does in the painting in the flesh. He has not aged a single day since coming to Ravenloft, and his wounds heal with startling rapidity, as long as he has not had his vitality restored. If the painting has revitalized the mar-quis, then he can be killed, but will return to life once vitality has worn off. Stezen hates dying when he has been revitalized, as it wastes the little time he has as a whole person."

					"Frantisek Markov is a tall man with broad features. He stands well over six feet tall but walks hunched over, sometimes even using his heavily muscled arms for support. He wears thick robes and leather gloves. Markov's eyes are black, perfectly matching the thick black hair he keeps slicked back. Frantisek talks slow-ly and carefully considers his words before speaking. If he is talking to someone that knows very little about the sciences, especially biology or chemistry, he will speak very slowly and use small words, as if the per-son he is speaking to is a particularly dense child.",

							"The Markovs were a minor noble family in Barovia when it was taken by the Dark Powers to form the first domain of Ravenloft. Several Mar-kovs were in Castle Ravenloft the night that Strahd became a vampire and slew his brother. The lucky Markovs in the castle were slain when Strahd vented his rage and bloodlust on the wedding guests. The unlucky ones disappeared into the bowels of the cas-tle and were never seen again.",
							"The remaining Markovs fled the village of Barovia and settled in and around the village of Vallaki. It was on a small pig farm outside Vallaki that Frantisek Markov was born. Frantisek was an intelligent child, quick to outpace the tutors his family could afford, especially in the sciences of biology and chemistry. Despite his quick and eager mind, Frantisek seemed doomed to the life of a pig farmer.",
							"Perhaps because of his interest in biology or because Frantisek seemed to have a certain way with knives, his family allowed him to butcher the hogs that were ready to go to market. Butchering the hogs gave the young boy a chance to study anatomy in a far more real way than studying books, and Frantisek began to indulge his curiosity. At first he would choose one pig from a herd and see how long it could last before the pain of being butchered killed it. He perfected a variety of alchemical concoctions that would paralyze the poor animal while he sliced it open. Frantisek made sure his custom elixirs wouldn't dull the animal's pain, lest some secret of its anatomy escape his notice. Soon he was vivisecting two and three hogs at the same time while happily and efficiently butchering the rest of the herd for sale. Once Frantisek had learned all he could of hogs, he began to seek new prey.",
							"At first, it was small animals around his farm, birds, cats, dogs, and rats. Then Frantisek would go into the woods and set traps for the animals that lived there. Soon he was experimenting on wolves, squirrels and even the occasional bear. As Frantisek grew older, strangers that visited his village sometimes disap-peared. Their clothes and money would be found in the woods around Vallaki. The villagers assumed the fools had tried to save some coin by spending the night in the woods around the village and paid for it with their lives. The truth was far worse. Frantisek started his greatest experiments, grafting parts from one creature to another. The surgery proved fatal for both creatures, but Frantisek never worried. The ones that lived were abandoned to the forest, and the ones that didn't were given to the pigs.",
							"If his family knew of his experiments, they indulged them. It gave the boy something to do and good butchers were hard to find. If nothing else Frantisek was a talented butcher.",
							"When he was a young man his family arranged for him to marry one of the local women in Vallaki. Lud-milla was beautiful, friendly, and several of her suitors were crushed to see her married to a butcher, even if his family was well connected.",
							"Frantisek took money he had saved from butchering animals for the local farmers and the occasional trust-ing stranger and opened a butcher shop in the village. At first things went well. Frantisek and Ludmilla made a decent living carving animals and always had some-thing to eat, and when the butcher shop closed Fran-tisek retreated to his labs to continue his experiments. At first Ludmilla was glad to be away from her distant and intimidating husband, but soon became curious about his experiments.",
							"One night Frantisek, usually so careful, left the door to his laboratory unlocked. His wife, overcome with curi-osity, opened the door and screamed at what she saw inside. Dead animals, twitching halves of beasts and unholy combinations of animals no god ever dreamed of stared at her with pleading eyes. They were silently begging her for release from a life of pain. She only stopped screaming when she saw her husband, star-ing at her, eyes wild with rage. Lady Markov berated her husband and threatened to tell the village of Fran-tisek's sick secrets. Frantisek grabbed his wife and drug her into his lab, slamming the door shut. She lived for three days. When Ludmilla could no longer serve his curiosity, Markov dumped her body in the forest as he had with so many other victims, but it proved to be a nearly fatal mistake. At first hunters thought they had found a horribly mangled beast, but when they moved closer they saw the once familiar face on the butchered corpse. Ludmilla was pretty and popular, and when her corpse was found, the village wanted answers. They came to the butcher shop at night and broke down the door. Frantisek was found in his lab and the dozens of missing travelers, hun-dreds of dead mutilated animals, and unnumbered vile experiments suddenly had a cause. The mob dragged Frantisek into the village square and began pelting him with stones. Markov, desperate to escape, charged through the mob and dashed headlong into the mists. When the mists finally cleared, he had been given his domain, Markovia."

He is convinced that the Dark Powers have hidden the secrets of his human form inside one of the animals on his island. Frantisek spends long hours in his labs dissecting creatures, making new monsters, and desperately searching for a cure for his condition. Since Markovia was flung into the Sea of Sorrows during the Grand Conjunction, his test subjects have become increasingly few and far between. Because of this, Markov is careful to make sure his subjects are thoroughly vivisected, and every inch of their anatomy explored and observed before he combines them with other creatures and casts them aside.

In death he appears much the same, yet a chill clings to him, and his hair and beard shift and move as if he was in a violent storm.

							"Captain Pieter van Riese spent his life on the open sea, and continues to do so in death. He started as a cabin boy serving on a merchant ship hail-ing from the Netherlands of Gothic Earth, and through hard work and boundless ambition, slowly rose up the ranks of sailors until he could afford to purchase and outfit his own ship. This, Riese christened the {@i Relentless}. The Captain seemed to have an innate understanding of the ocean and sailing,predicting storms and sailing his ship through the worst of them without losing a single sailor. Despite his mastery of the sea, Riese cut a haunting figure amongst the sail-ors of Gothic Earth. Discipline was strictly enforced on his ship, with harsh punishment meted out for the smallest of infractions. Any sailor that questioned the captain or his methods would soon find themselves bound hand and foot and thrown to the sharks that followed the {@i Relentless}.",
							"Riese was a wealthy man, but money meant nothing to him. His sole cares were his ship and his reputa-tionfor doing the impossible. It was this reputation that would spell Riese's doom.",
							"In a forgotten port in the Far East of Gothic Earth, whilst unloading cargo, Riese first heard of the leg-endary Northwest Passage. The means to travel from Europe to Asia by traveling through the icy waters north of the American continent, a ship that could find that passage could transport cargo from Europe to Asia in less than half the time of other ships, and gain fame and untold wealth.",
							"Riese attempted to find the Northwest Passage twice, but crushing icebergs and violent blizzards made him turn back each time. For Riese, this was completely unacceptable. Riese had sailed his ship through hur-ricanes, pirates, and doldrums, only to be defeated by ice. He began to obsess about finding the passage. When he sailed to find the passage a third time, Riese would not be defeated.",
							"As ice and snow closed in around the {@i Relentless}, Riese ordered the ship onward. The crew grew ner-vous as the ice closed in, and lost their nerve when the {@i Relentless} was battered by high seas, icebergs the size of mountains threatening to smash the ship to tinder. A blizzard was closing in, and already the air was freezing, as the snow fell heavily. The crew appointed a spokesman to take their concerns to the captain. They wished to abandon the {@i Relentless}, and man lifeboats back to safety and civilization.",
							"Riese was far past simple enragement. He strangled the spokesman with his bare hands, and told the crew that they would either find the passage or die trying. The crew, defeated, returned to their positions and prayed to whatever gods they held dear. The blizzard grew stronger and stronger, the air seemed to freeze and snow fell so thick it was a white sheet that ob-scured everything.",
							"Riese, realizing he and his ship were doomed, called out to any being that would listen, offering up the lives of his men if any entity would allow himself and the {@i Relentless} to make the passage. Something dark reached out from the edges of sanity, accept-ing Riese's offer. The crew was torn from the ship, and the {@i Relentless} and her captain lost their physical forms and became apparitions sailing through a mist bound sea. When the mist cleared Riese found him-self in a new sea."

The {@i Relentless} endlessly crisscrosses the Sea of Sorrows, desperately trying to make sense of the madness.",

							"In the dead of night, Dr Blake Ramsay loaded his wife, Lady Helen Ramsay, and daughter, Lyza, into a boat he had purchased in secret, and fled the domain of Mordentshire, scant minutes ahead of ruthless bounty hunters. Ramsay was a brilliant researcher who was relentless in his search for the truth, and that was why he had to flee. Ramsay cared little for such mundane things as curing a disease or replacing a defective organ without killing the patient. Such things were child's play for the doctor. What Ramsay wanted to discover was the nature and limits of pain.",
							"How much pain could someone take? A man? A wom-an? A child? What would happen if he removed an organ without anesthesia? What would happen if he removed the pain centers of the brain? What would happen if he stimulated the pain centers beyond what a mortal could possibly endure? Ramsay had to know the answers to these questions.",
							"Understandably, Blake had trouble finding volunteers to help him with his research. He began to take them from the undesirables of Mordentshire. At first he took in beggars and homeless, but soon he wanted differ-ent patients. Undesirables were sickly and poorly fed. Their ability to withstand pain was limited compared to a healthy patient, so Ramsay began to find his sub-jects from the wealthy. Soon the children of the elite began to disappear, only to reappear two weeks later with their organs removed, their scalps pulled back and their brains pierced with silver needles. The lucky ones were found dead.",

The doctor turned to see nearly a dozen people racing to stop him. They had seen his face, as had his hapless \"volunteer\". Des-perate, Ramsay slit the throat of the man and fled into the darkness. He and his family left Mordentshire less than twelve hours later.",
							"Ramsay and his family sailed for days before reaching a lonely island. Ramsay began to build a house and a laboratory for himself and his family. He was aided by a group of silent islanders that appeared to aid him, then vanished from the island.",
							"The doctor realized he would never be able to complete his research on this island, and began to look for an heir to complete his work after his passing. Blake was fond of his daughter, who had a brilliant mind, but he wondered if he could produce an heir that was better able to continue his research. Ramsay's wife soon fell pregnant and their second child, Gregory, was born. Gregory's body was covered in weeping sores and his body was sickly and twisted. After a few years, Blake's wife gave birth to a second son, Blake Jr. The child was cold and distant, but never devel-oped his father's brilliance. Blake soon dismissed his son as a dullard and concentrated all his efforts on his daughter. The doctor made his daughter study endlessly, with very few breaks to sleep, eat, or play. It was during one of these breaks that as she took the airs, Ramsay watched her slip from the cliffs that surrounded the island. Blake sprinted down the three hundred foot cliff face, to find the broken body of his daughter.",
							"Ramsay brought her body back to his laboratory and started working. He would not be robbed of his only chance at immortality by something so trivial as death. For two weeks Blake labored to fix his daughter, re-fusing food and sleep. The accident had driven Blake mad, and in his madness he found strength.",
							"After two weeks of failure Ramsay heard a voice in the back of his mind telling him to use his wife and sons to fix his daughter. Ramsay raced to his home and slaughtered his family. He brought the corpses back to his lab and carefully repaired his daughter. At midnight her eyes snapped open and she asked what had transpired.Although his daughter seemed like she was alive, Blake was horrified to discover that her eyes, once a deep blue, were now an almost venom-ous green. Blake has tried dozens of times since that night to replace his daughter's eyes, but they always revert to green."

Renthon demanded to be the head of the order, and was forced to flee the wrath of angry monks.",
							"He wondered the domains until he came to the broken shores of Lamordia. The domain was in the depths of winter and Renthon was weak from lack of food and shelter. As night fell Renthon was visited by the Prince of Twilight. The Prince talked to Renthon, telling him how every mortal had been cheated and damaged years ago. Mortals used to possess two souls. The Prince told Renthon how to summon his other soul from the beyond, and instructed the cleric to write his instructions down. Renthon disappeared shortly after the Grand Conjunction, leaving over 1,000 copies of the text in his house.",

By driv-ing the needle into the brain of an intelligent creature and drawing out their cerebral fluid (a process which takes about 10 minutes and kills the victim), and then injecting the fluid directly into his own brain, the doctor can increase his intelligence dramatically for a short time."

							"The Lady of Ravens was born into a world of silence and isolation. She was the last in a long line of nobility that had long fallen into inbreed-ing and insanity. Her mother died when the Lady was a toddler and the Lady of Ravens neither remembers her nor cares. The Lady's father spent his days in a drugged haze and wandered the halls of the castle, talking to unseen spirits and friends long dead. The Lady never talked to the servants that raised her or took care of her day to day needs,not considering them important enough to matter in any way. The Lady despised the other children that lived in the castle, and they soon learned to avoid her altogether. The Lady of Raven's only joy was the Tower of Flint. A 400 foot tall edifice of gray stone that sat in the middle of her cas-tle, hundreds of ravens roosted in the tower. The Lady of Ravens had inherited the ability to talk to ravens, passed down by her mother. The Lady spent hours in the tower, telling the ravens stories, and listening to the tales they told her in return. After her father's death the Lady rarely left the tower, spending days in conversa-tion with her ravens. This was the way of things un-til the Lady reached her late teens. Looking from the windows of her tower, she spotted a handsome young man. The Lady became obsessed with the man, the son of a servant, and set her ravens to follow his every move. When he departed to fight in some nameless war, she was devastated, barely sleeping or eating for a year. She was overjoyed to hear the news from one of her ravens\u2014the man had returned. Her joy turned to rage when the young man immediately fell into the arms of another woman. Devastated and enraged, the Lady sent her ravens to tear the young lovers apart. Grief stricken, the Lady spent several days in her tower mourning the death of her obsession. When she left she found the Tower of Flint was standing alone on an isle in the middle of a vast sea. To make matters worse, the Lady found she could not remember her own name. Even more devastating, although she could command the ravens of her isle with an act of will, she could no longer talk to her friends."

							"Alain Monette was the infamous captain of the privateer vessel {@i Ouragan}. Monette was an incredible captain. He knew every rope, nail, and barrel of ballast on the Ouragan. He had seen every hazard on the open sea and feared no obstacle, whether natu-ral, magical, or man made. Monette's skill as a captain and his legendary conquests brought sailors flocking to his flag. Once the new sailors were at sea, they found out why Captain Alain Monette constantly took on new crew. Monette was an absolute despot on his ship. Even minor infractions of his complicated and extensive code resulted in brutal beatings and floggings. The shred-ded skins of the sailors that Monette had keelhauled were hung from the yard arms as grisly trophies. Even-tually the crew had too much. Monette had gaff hooks inserted under the rib cage of a sailor who violated one of his obscure codes then dragged the poor fool behind the ship. It didn't take long before splashes of the sailor and trail of blood attracted the attention of sharks. After the sailor stopped screaming the crew, angry and tired of being whipped like dogs, spontaneously mutinied. The officer's joined the crew and Monette was dragged from his cabin and savagely beaten. The crew tied ropes to his hands and legs then keelhauled. Much to the crew's surprise, Monette survived. The crew simply keelhauled him again, and when he survived a third time. Monette stubbornly clung to life, cursing and swearing revenge. The crew stripped Monette and tied him to the mast. The captain was flogged for over an hour. Still Monette refused to die. Out of ideas and tired of the stubborn captain's refusal to die, the crew simply threw him overboard and sailed away. When the crew was out of sight, the captain finally surrendered into unconsciousness. Monette awoke in a cave. Dozens of furry bodies covered him, licking the blood out of his wounds. Bats. Monette was covered in dozens of small bats. He survived the next few days by catching what bats he could and devouring the screeching creatures raw. At night when his wounds proved too much the bats descended and fed on him in turn. Monette didn't know it, but the Dark Powers had noticed the captain and refused to let him die. As he feasted on the bats, the Dark Powers made them one. After a week, Mon-ette could move around and explore his surroundings, finding himself on a small barren island in the middle of a vast sea. At night the constellations were similar to the ones from his home, but somehow wrong. The seas surrounding Monette's island were treacherous and full of shipwrecks. The beaches were covered in the desiccated skeletons of hundreds of sailors. Almost unconsciously, he started stacking the bones at the top of the tallest point of his island. Impossibly the bones fused together, forming a tower. Monette worked tire-lessly for over a month, living off the bats he caught and the plants that grew in the thin soil of his island. The last bone Monette placed was a skull. The skull was set on top of a pillar of fused spines in the highest room of the tower. When the skull was set, it began to glow and raised into the air above the pillar of spines. Monette's tower, a lighthouse he called the Eye of Midnight, was complete. Monette tried to escape the island on a small boat that he cobbled together from detritus that washed ashore on his island. The further he sailed from the island, the weaker Monette became. Before he had sailed a mile, Monette knew he would be dead if he sailed any further. He was trapped."

Sailors that see its light inevitably follow it into the treacherous reefs that surround L'île de la Tempête. Their ships are dashed upon the rocks. The few sailors that survive the storm and the waves to make it ashore are far from safe. If Monette is in his human form, he will greet the sailors and ask where they came from. Monette can be polite, even charming when he wants to be, but it's all a facade. Monette is merely buying time until he can transform. Monette is an afflicted ly-canthrope. He cannot control when he changes, but knows it has no connection to the moon. Monette isn't positive, but has recently started to suspect it is con-nected to the changing of the tide. Once he becomes the beast, Monette relentlessly hunts the sailors on his island. He devours the first few victims he kills but toys with his remaining victims. When Monette changes back to his human form, he will pretend to help them remaining prey on his island, telling them about the beast that lives in his island and begging them for help, reveling in their fear and helplessness. When Monette becomes the beast, the hunt starts again. Monette finds the isolation and boredom of L'île de la Tempête maddening. He constantly searches for a way off the island, but to no avail."

Impossibly the bones fused together, forming a tower. Monette worked tire-lessly for over a month, living off the bats he caught and the plants that grew in the thin soil of his island. The last bone Monette placed was a skull. The skull was set on top of a pillar of fused spines in the highest room of the tower. When the skull was set, it began to glow and raised into the air above the pillar of spines. Monette's tower, a lighthouse he called the Eye of Midnight, was complete. Monette tried to escape the island on a small boat that he cobbled together from detritus that washed ashore on his island. The further he sailed from the island, the weaker Monette became. Before he had sailed a mile, Monette knew he would be dead if he sailed any further. He was trapped."

							"The light of the Eye of Midnight reaches far beyond Ravenloft into hundreds of other worlds. Sailors that see its light inevitably follow it into the treacherous reefs that surround L'île de la Tempête. Their ships are dashed upon the rocks. The few sailors that survive the storm and the waves to make it ashore are far from safe. If Monette is in his human form, he will greet the sailors and ask where they came from. Monette can be polite, even charming when he wants to be, but it's all a facade. Monette is merely buying time until he can transform. Monette is an afflicted ly-canthrope. He cannot control when he changes, but knows it has no connection to the moon. Monette isn't positive, but has recently started to suspect it is con-nected to the changing of the tide. Once he becomes the beast, Monette relentlessly hunts the sailors on his island. He devours the first few victims he kills but toys with his remaining victims. When Monette changes back to his human form, he will pretend to help them remaining prey on his island, telling them about the beast that lives in his island and begging them for help, reveling in their fear and helplessness. When Monette becomes the beast, the hunt starts again. Monette finds the isolation and boredom of L'île de la Tempête maddening. He constantly searches for a way off the island, but to no avail."

					"Lyron is a natural talker who has a way with people, instantly likeable, but will quickly turn every conver-sation to his favorite topic, himself. Lyron is a natural actor who creates a convincing illusion of normality for a time, but it always falls apart, revealing the truth; that Lyron is a complete sociopath who cares about no one save himself.",

							"Lyron Evensong was a bard of exceptional ability, who came from the same world as Lord Soth and Vlad Drakov. His bardic talents were only exceeded by his complete self absorption. Lyron was incapable of seeing other people as anything but tools to be used and discarded. It mattered not whether his victims were women nor men, rich nor poor, royalty nor the basest peasant, as long as they did what Lyron wanted. He thought this was the natural way of things, and that anything he forced his victims to do was inherently good, because Lyron himself was inherently good.",
							"As his fame as a performer grew, Lyron amassed a better treasury than most kings. He paid a wizard to enchant his favorite instrument, a harpsichord, to en-snare the senses of those who heard it. If the wizard did his work well, the harpsichord would play of its own accord any song Lyron knew just as well as he could, and it would cast a spell on anyone who heard it, making them into Lyron's slaves. But something went wrong. Horribly wrong.",
							"The wizard didn't make the harpsichord part of Lyron, he made Lyron part of the harpsichord. The bard couldn't move more than a few hundred feet from the instrument. The harpsichord couldn't play on its own, but Lyron could change from a living, breathing being to an immaterial specter. While he was immaterial, Lyron couldn't be attacked by blade nor spell, but could cast spells of his own.",
							"Lyron continued to manipulate everyone around him to gain himself more wealth and favors, but with a new sadistic streak. The bard thought he was untouchable. A god. He could get away with murder, blackmail, and thievery, and no one could stop him.",
							"The few that resisted Lyron's powerful compulsions soon became the target of his undying hatred. Most met their end thanks to Lyron's wickedly sharp dagger. The few that Lyron thought might prove able to defeat him were betrayed by enspelled friends or family.",
							"One night, Lyron was the guest of a small noble family, well off, but extremely well connected. For some unfathomable reason the mother resisted Lyron's spells. Lyron, infuriated beyond comprehension, her children slaughter their mother, then feast on the remains. The Dark Powers took Lyron into Ravenloft and gave him his own domain, Claveria."

When he was ready to retire, his king granted the wizard the title of baron and tasked the necromancer with found-ing a colony to the north of the kingdom. Retainers looking to prove themselves and make their fortunes presented themselves before him, who accepted their service. Meredoth had no interest in ruling a colony and hoped the retainers would reign in his stead. The king hoped that Meredoth's power and reputation would attract people looking to settle in a new region, wanting the wizard to expand the kingdom into the wilderness beyond its borders. Meredoth wanted to continue his research in peace, but unfortunately for him, the king proved correct.",

							"The first winter was unbelievably harsh. Freezing winds and constant storms isolated the colony from aid and soon the colonists were freezing and starv-ing. Hundreds died. For Meredoth, this was a useful boon. The dead colonists could be reanimated to per-form simple tasks, and needing neither need food nor warmth,could work until they literally fell apart. When some of his retainers objected, they joined the ranks of the risen dead.",
							"When spring returned a new group of colonists, thousands strong arrived at the bedraggled colony. Meredoth could barely retain his rage. The new col-onists greatly increased the scope of his barony and constantly sought his attention. They slaughtered his zombies before he could stop them, then acted like heroes. Meredoth couldn't kill them all, and was forced to stop his studies to deal with their petty demands.",
							"When winter returned, with its heavy snows and storms, Meredoth finally had a chance to resume his studies. Soon he had made his most important discovery yet. A new form of undead, intelligent and fiercely loyal to him. Meredoth called them the leb-endtod.",
							"With almost perfect timing, the colonists again appeared at his door. The winter was harsh, and they were starving and freezing. The storms had torn apart their homes and forced the residents to stagger into the night seeking aid. Most were found frozen in heaps the next day, vainly trying to use their bodies to shield their loved ones. Hundreds had died. Food stores ran low and it was whispered that some of the far flung settlements had resorted to cannibalism and beastly rituals. Wendigo haunted the night. Meredoth was about to turn around and leave the colonists to their fate when he had an idea. He brought all the colonists his castle could hold into his fortress and sealed the doors. The fires were stoked and great food stores were unlocked.",
							"Meredoth promised the colonists a feast. That night the colonists drank their fill and toasted their lord, who walked among them, pledging to them that it would be alright, and he had a plan. By morning every colonist that had come into his castle was dead. Meredoth had poisoned the meal. The few scant survivors were no match for a powerful wizard and his horde of undead. Once every living thing in the castle was slain, Mere-doth set to work. As he raised his new minions, the mists closed in. When they cleared, Meredoth found that he now lived on an island. Nearby islands would supply the people the arcanist needed for his experi-ments, and the whole area was surrounded by a thick wall of mist that allowed no escape. Meredoth was undisturbed and continued his experiments. After a century, he was given the Nocturnal Sea as his do-main and it connected to Ravenloft's growing core."

							"Kartak Spellseer was one of the greatest arcane spellcasters in Faerun in his day. His re-search pushed the boundaries of magic, especial-ly necromancy. His reputation and life's work came crashing down when a party of adventurers discov-ered the fourteen children he kidnapped. Kartak planned to sacrifice the children to fuel his ascendan-cy to lichdom. The adventurers attempted to interrupt the ceremony at a crucial moment, but failed. The souls of the children were devoured and Kartak dis-appeared. The adventurers barely escaped with their lives.",
							"Kartak's remaining family were deeply stigmatized by the actions of their most famous member. They changed their name to Spulzeer and tried to move on with their lives.",
							"Generations passed.",
							"Chardath Spulzeer was born to Kaisha Spulzeer. His youth was not a happy one. The family could never recover from the stigma placed upon it by Kartak. Kai-sha and Chardath eked out a living offering wealthy patrons bloodsports and other more exotic entertain-ments. Kaisha cared little for her son and seemed to care even less for her daughter who was born a few years later. Kaisha alternated between berating and ignoring her children. Chardath tried to shield his sister from the worst of it, but she never spoke. He took to calling her Marble to mark her silence and pale beauty. Kaisha died unmourned and forgotten by her children when Chardath was in his late teens. Char-dath became lord of Castle Spulzeer and all its lands, but didn't care.",
							"Kartak, in the meantime, had transported himself and all of his magical research to a lair in the Kuldin Peaks. After a few centuries, he ran afoul of a group of adventurers that destroyed his lair and ended his wretched unlife. Kartak was a powerful spellcaster and had planned for this eventuality. His soul was transferred to an ancient spellbook deep in the bow-els of Castle Spulzeer. His evil corrupted everything around the castle. The lands yielded few crops and winters became long and bitterly cold.",
							"One night Chardath woke from a fitful sleep. He wandered the castle as if listening to spectral voices that only he could hear. He found the ancient spellbook in a library he never knew existed in the bowels of Cas-tle Spulzeer. There he read the spellbook as if it was a novel. With every page Kartak took more and more of Chardath's mind. When he finished the spellbook, Chardath was in a daze. Chardath watched what he was doing, but could not stop himself. Kartak instruct-ed him where to find a cursed dagger with a ruby pommel, long hidden under Castle Spulzeer.",
							"Chardath climbed to Marble's room. He took the dagger and slit her throat as she slept. Chardath was sud-denly in control of his body and realized what he had done. The thought broke Chardath's sanity. When he realized there was someone else in the chamber with him, Chardath picked up his sister's body and fled.",
							"Katrak, his body restored by the sacrifice, smiled, and walked out of the castle.",
							"Chardath buried his sister the following morning. Then sank into despair. He knew he couldn't fight the lich, but he desperately wanted revenge. Kartak, for his part, was gone. He had left the castle, but was compelled to return to Marble's chamber once a year on the anniversary of her death. Chardath was never in the castle on the anniversary, having found the re-minder of his sister's fate too painful.",
							"Chardath continued to search for a means to have his revenge, and one day found something that might just do it. He found a lamp in the catacombs of his an-cestors that summoned a noble djinn. The djinn stole a portion of Kartak's power and gave it to Chardath.",
							"Kartak immediately hired a band of adventurers to infiltrate the castle and retrieve the dagger used to kill Marble. The adventurers found the dagger at the same time that Marble's ghost, Chardath, and Kar-tak arrived to claim it. A tremendous battle ensued. Spells rebounded from the walls and blood spattered the books of the library. A mystic vortex surrounded the castle and pulled it into Ravenloft. Only Kartak realized what was happening and quickly teleported to safety."

Isolde is a natural crusader and was dispatched by her lords to innumerable worlds to lead rebellions against petty tyrants and the diabolic forces of the Nine Hells. Isol-de was rightly lauded as unbeatable in combat, yet all fell apart against one specific incubus. Isolde sought to convince a baroness on a forgotten world to treat her subjects as valued people and improve the lives of all under her leadership. The incubus, rather, wanted the baroness to tax her subjects into abject poverty to fund a lifestyle of debauchery and insatiable lust. Unfortu-nately, Isolde failed and the baroness and her subjects were set on the road to ruin. Isolde swore revenge against the incubus and tracked him across the planes. The incubus, who Isolde came to know was known as the Gentleman Caller, was intelligent and had allies over thousands of worlds. Relentless, Isolde finally managed to corner her prey. The Gentleman Caller, desperate to escape her, fled to the one demiplane he knew Isolde could never enter, Ravenloft. Isolde re-turned to her celestial lords and begged permission to follow the incubus into the demiplane. Her lords agreed but set conditions. She would have to remain in human form, and, once she entered Ravenloft, would never be allowed to leave. Isolde agreed at once. In truth, Isolde would have gone whether her lords gave her permission or not.",

Instead, Isolde helps where she can and continues her search for the Gentleman Caller.

Their physical form twists to match their soul. A brutal mass murderer's hands may turn to knives, a vain person may become trapped in a mirror. Isolde calls this the Twisting. Isolde doesn't mind the Twisting, she feels it should have always been this way.",
							"The Dark Powers are aware of Isolde, but prefer to torture her, rather than kill her. The phantom flyers that announce the arrival of the Carnival are a curse from the Dark Powers. Evil creatures that touch the pam-phlets instinctively hate the Carnival and most espe-cially Isolde."

							"Lord Malkant Hilfin was one of the best strategic minds of his age. He earned his fortune and title serving in well over a dozen wars as his kingdom became an empire. He never learned to fight, as he well knew that melee combat was base and dirty, but more than made up for it with his mind for logistics and an amazing ability to predict his enemies moves. Malkant always led his armies from the rear, yet they never lost. After his career in the military was over, Malkant turned his genius to games. Every eight years, he would invite the best and brightest minds in the empire to compete with him in a series of increasingly fiendish games. Malkant always played fair, and was gracious in victo-ry, but a raging tyrant when he lost. Malkant considered losing a stain on his honor, and it drove him mad. Only one person was ever able to beat him regularly, Selmar Callista. Selmar was a general of incredible talent that had nearly beaten Malkant a half dozen times on the battlefield. Malkant's reputation was only saved by the vast disparity in numbers he could commit to the bat-tlefield. Even then, Callista had gotten close to winning more than once. Although he would never admit it to himself, Malkant was afraid of the general. One night Selmar wasn't just winning, he was crushing Malkant. Everything Malkant tried failed, and Selmar laughed long and hard as he won. Telling old war stories and lamenting how close he came to crushing Malkant on the field of battle. It was too much for Malkant to bear. While Malkant took advantage of an opportune break to devise a strategy to turn this crushing defeat into a merely humiliating defeat, he was approached by one of the party guests. The woman wore all black, and try as he might, he still cannot remember her face. He only remembers her piercing green eyes. She offered Malkant a deal. If he would kill Selmar then Malkant would never lose again. He accepted without a second thought. He turned and grabbed a fire poker and be-gan to rampage through his own house. He beat every person he found to death. Women, children, servants that had loyally served the general for years all died under his clubbing blows. Selmar was the last to die. As Selmar's last breath left his body, he cursed his foe for a fool and a pathetic egomaniac. Malkant laughed. Once he was finished, he threw back the curtains and opened the windows to ease the smell of blood and fear. He was shocked to discover the house was shrouded in mist."

His clothes are threadbare and ink stained. Juste is often distracted, talking to himself about salient plot points. Any who talks to him while Juste is talking to himself is stared at as if they are the most boorish of thugs.",

							"Lemot Juste was the leading playwright and dramatist of his day. The stage was his home and as he performed he lived a thousand lives. Audiences flocked to his theater to watch him perform. Juste was also a brilliant playwright, but he had one weakness. He had no understanding of the nuance and subtle-ty of tragedy. His attempts to create a sublime trage-dy failed time and again. Audiences would howl with laughter as his characters died.",
							"Eventually Juste's company began to lean into the comedic aspects of his tragedies. Audiences laughed harder and longer than ever before. Lemot plead-ed with his company to play into the tragedy of their deaths, but they refused. Juste had tried to write trag-edies, but he just wasn't able. He could write com-edies, dramas, but never a tragedy. The company wouldn't endanger their own careers or artistic integ-rity by trying to turn a play into something it wasn't.",
							"Juste had had enough. His new play was a masterpiece. Every single character died a horrible death. The bodies were left on the stage for the rest of the play. By the time the curtain closed, the stage would be a monument to pain, degradation and death.",
							"But Juste wasn't finished. The night the play opened, he stole away to the prop room and in place ofall the props, he left actual weapons. He replaced the harmless water from the poison bottles with horrifying deadly toxins. Finally, he placed a real blade in the guillotine. The audience would never forget the finale to this play.",
							"Juste watched the play from the wings. When the assassins struck the young lovers, the audience gasped. When the mayor choked on his tongue swal-lowing poisoned wine, his face turned black and chil-dren cried. When the tragic heroine was led to the guillotine and her life taken by the falling blade, the audience howled.",
							"Juste walked onto stage as the curtain closed. He expected to hear raucous applause, but instead he was booed. The audience screamed in rancor, they demanded their money back, they cursed the playwright.",
							"Juste fled the stage. The audience stood in the auditorium, venting their disgust and rage. Juste locked the doors that led from the theater, then set the build-ing on fire. Lemot fled into the darkness as flames lit the night sky.",
							"He found his way to a friend's theater, and seeking to escape a gathering mist, crept inside to watch the show. Exhausted by his activities, Lemot soon fell asleep.",
							"When he awoke the theater was empty. Juste, although he was familiar with his friend's theater, felt something was wrong. Details had changed. This theater had neither a prop room, nor shop to create new props. Juste found the auditorium, which was appro-priately huge, a small writing room which doubled as a bedchamber and kitchen, and backstage.",
							"Juste tried to leave through the front doors, but was overwhelmed with dread at the thought of stepping foot through the doors. Frustrated, he returned to the writing room and started to create.",
							"Hours later when Juste looked up from his script, he found himself in the middle of a haunted forest. Spirits leered at him from the shadows and the skeletal re-mains of a castle loomed in the distance. Juste was amazed, but not afraid. He wandered through the for-est, and soon found himself on stage. He was back in the theater. Juste was elated. He wrote again and again, creating illusionary world after world. He could write anything he wanted, and the theater could cre-ate the illusion for him.",

When the play ends, the door opens and the audience simply leaves. Scaena moves frequent-ly, and the audience will find themselves in a distant domain when they leave.",

He and his clan whiled away their nights stalking unfortunate peas-ants. Some, they devoured as a clan. Others they dropped from great heights into steep ravines. For sport, the werebats would judge the length and vol-ume of the peasant screams, the number of ledges they slammed into and how the broken body landed. One day, everything changed. A colossal flying for-tress appeared in the sky above the werebat's moun-tain. Curious, the lycanthropes flew to the fortress and discovered its sole inhabitant, a human dressed in elaborate ornate armor. The human said he was Kravon, a Lord of Dragons. Lance in hand, the human commanded the werebats to bow to him and become his slaves. The werebats attacked. As the last blow fell, only the Baron and two of his companions lived. The Baron declared himself lord of the flying fortress, which he dubbed the Eyrie. When one of his compan-ions challenged the Baron's right to rule, the Baron shredded the fool's wings and threw him from the for-tress. The remaining werebat swore unending loyalty to his new lord and master. The Baron soon discov-ered he couldn't fly far from the Eyrie without being pushed back to the fortress by powerful winds. Even worse, the Eyrie seemed free to travel in any direc-tion, but only those directions contrary to the Baron's wishes. The werebat minion soon returned, along with innocents from the ground below. The Baron in-fected the innocents with the curse of lycanthropy and found they were loyal minions that would follow his every command. The Baron tested his new troops by ordering them to tear apart the last remaining threat to his rule of the Eyrie to shreds."

Ivana welcomed him to her private baths (an offer he was unable to decline). Sadly for him, she was feeling under the weather, and-was displeased with him. Inspired by the sickle shape of the moon, she had him decapitated so she could shower in his blood. Once she was finished, the head-less body was thrown into a stream, close to Levkarest. The body floated downstream until it approached Stur-ben, where it became tangled underneath a wooden bridge. The evening of the following sickle moon, the body emerged. Ravenloft's Dark Powers provided it with a phantom horse and a sickle shaped with a sharp edge. Since then, the Horseman has ridden forward to sever the necks of unfortunate adventurers. Running cannot save you. By the time you hear the thunder-ing hooves of the Horseman's steed, it's already too late. The Headless Horseman charges down the road that is his domain, taking heads in a futile quest to re-claim his own. The Headless Horseman looks like a gentleman dressed in black, and rides a black stallion named Spitfire. It would be a normal sight, except that the rider's head is gone. Despite missing his head, the Horseman doesn't have any trouble finding his victims or using his weapons to deadly effect."

							"The Headless Horseman never sits still. He rides at full gallop through his foes, strik-ing with sickle and whip before disappearing into the mists that surround his domain. He always charges from a new angle, catching his victims off guard. Even worse, the Headless Horseman is followed by  clouds of decapitated heads. These heads follow the Horse-man wherever he goes. The heads laugh, howl, cry, and scream. The heads assist the headless horseman when they are called upon and haunt the dreams of survivors for years."

							"When a crescent moon hangs in the sky, the Headless Horseman rides across the Domains of Dread. The Horseman is the lord of the Winding Road, a unique domain that doesn't have static boundaries. Instead the Winding Road can appear on any road, even out-side of Ravenloft. The Winding road is 15 feet across and 1 mile long. The road changes to match the sur-rounding terrain, but the borders are always shrouded in mist. Creatures that try to leave the road are lost in mist for what feels like hours. They are constantly harassed by shadowy shapes that never seem to ma-terialise, only to return back to the road the instant they left. Sharp eyed creatures even see the backs of them-selves stepping off the road into the mists a few feet away. The Headless Horseman is always encountered in the Winding Road."
