								"When I was in college, my mythology professor gave us an unconventional assignment. He told us to go into the woods alone with a notebook, stay there for an hour, then start writing whatever we found ourselves thinking about until we had a three-page paper. Given the magazine I now edit, it shouldn't come as a shock that my essay was about monsters. Specifically, I wrote a paper that said I understood why people who were alive not that long ago believed monsters stalked the wilds. Even today many folks believe that a bigfoot, yeti, jackalope, jersey devil, or other cryptid hides somewhere deep in the wilderness rarely disturbed by humans. Even if you're a skeptic like me, your love of fantasy storytelling can't keep you from asking, \"But what if here there were be dragons?\"",
								"Nature isn't just some component of fantasy. Yes, it serves as an evocative setting for adventures, but nature is much more than that. It creates stories and mythologies. The vast wilderness on this planet inspires us, terrifies us, and takes our breath away. When we think of fantasy wilderness, our minds may go to fey groves and unicorn forests, but vast deserts, wicked swamps, untamed oceans, and mysterious underground tunnels are all part of fantastical settings. Our real-life planet and worlds of high fantasy go hand-in-hand.",
								"In fact, they go together so well that I didn't even realize this issue of ARCADIA is themed around nature until {@link Spencer Hibnick|https://twitter.com/PestoEnthusiast}, MCDM's insightful lead playtester, pointed it out to me. I just thought we were putting out another three strong articles from awesome creators. But as the fates would have it, ARCADIA 7 is all about nature.",
								"{@link Sharang Biswas's|https://twitter.com/SharangBiswas} \"The Pickling Guild\" presents a secret organization that searches the wilderness for delicious ingredients and cures for terrible diseases, {@link Sara Thompson|https://twitter.com/mustangsart} shows us a ranger who defends his grove like no other in \"Aethelfaer,\" and {@link Hannah Rose|https://twitter.com/wildrosemage}, an editor who has worked on every issue of ARCADIA so far, finally gives druids and rangers the magic items they deserve in \"Wonders of the Wild.\"",
								"This issue is a good reminder that there is plenty of inspiration for our games and characters in the real world. While I personally think the best way to get inspired is to head on out into the wilderness, that\"s not always an option. Even if you do live close to an awesome outdoor environment and have the means and time to explore it, there are places all over our planet to check out that will make your brain burst with gaming goodness.",
								"Luckily books, magazines, television, film, and the Internet make those places easy to explore. As a former National Geographic employee, I can tell you that the deep sea holds centuries-old {@link Greenland sharks|https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/12/science/greenland-shark-longest-living.html} with poison flesh, that a natural gas field in Turkmenistan called the \"{@link Door to Hell|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YICzXLAtQ58}\" has been burning for fifty years, and that in {@link Tsingy de Bemaraha National Park|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsingy_de_Bemaraha_Strict_Nature_Reserve} in Madagascar, the limestone formations that create the rock forest are so sharp that they cut through flesh and most equipment, making exploration of the place difficult. If those don't get your game brain going, there's a whole world out there to explore. Or heck, go beyond Earth and into the wilds of space. {@link Jupiter's red spot|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Red_Spot} is sure to inspire an adventure or two."

Anyone can be a member\u2014a modest annual fee grants some special privileges and access to any of the dozen or so chapterhouses located in major cities around the world. In these cities, members enjoy regular tasting events\u2014meetings where recipes, ingredients, and techniques are swapped\u2014and a shop that sells specialized equipment, rare fermentation components, and food created by master guild members. Wealthier chapterhouses circulate a colorful, informative newsletter.",
						"Senior members carry a badge that identifies their membership, earning them hospitality from the group's many solitary members in remote locations. Yet the mere existence of members outside major urban hubs perplexes curious observers. What benefits can these members possibly derive from what is clearly a social club?",
						"The Pickling Guild is, in truth, a secret society that tracks the spread of magical maladies and plagues, working behind the scenes to cure and contain such afflictions. Their public-facing activities are a front, meant to throw off suspicion, cultivate useful contacts, and supplement the guild's coffers for their more important work. In addition to brewing fine ales and preserving fiery pepper sauces, senior members dispatch agents to discover the source of a nasty infection, deal with a particularly virulent fungal outbreak, or tend to important personages who contract mysterious illnesses. Solitary agents in remote regions are senior representatives who investigate and research strange and deadly diseases. Only a small fraction of the guild's members are aware of this greater truth.",
						"These cloak-and-dagger tactics keep the agents safe and hidden from powerful adversaries. The guild has to fend off the moves and countermoves of a cult connected to demon lords of pestilence and fungi, a cabal of evil druids bent on spreading diseases to \"restore the balance of rot\", and a mummy lord named Numha, who somehow got entangled with the guild a long time ago. These are just a few of the villains who want to destroy the organization\u2014any agent of decay and malady is a deadly foe to the Pickling Guild.",
						"While members deemed both worthy and useful to the greater mission of the guild are allowed to advance through its ranks and learn of the greater mysteries, they are all sworn to secrecy. Members who break this oath are removed from the guild and may have their memories magically modified to erase any recollection of the guild whatsoever.",

								"When people refer to the Pickling Guild's intentions, goals, or actions, they (usually unknowingly) refer to those of the Directors, the mysterious leaders of the organization. Spread throughout the realm, the Directors meet in secret, sometimes in person and sometimes through magical communication devices. They make decisions about what missions need to be undertaken, who among the ranks should be promoted, and any other major actions the guild must take. They tend not to involve themselves, as a body, in chapter leadership (though individual Directors may take an interest in such matters). As the most capable members of the guild, they take part in special missions if a particularly dangerous or serious threat under the guild's purview shows itself. There are very few Directors: about half a dozen, who masquerade as lower-ranked members of the guild.",
								"At the opposite end of the guild hierarchy are the Annual Members, who form the majority of the membership. These are dues-paying hobbyists who enjoy the social scene and minor benefits membership provides. They are unaware of the guild's secret mission.",
								"Between these two ranks are the Fermenters, the junior members, and the Artisans, the senior members. Fermenters and Artisans are part of the guild's inner circle. They're in the know about the guild's mission and undertake tasks and quests toward it. They may perform library or laboratory research, visit sick patients, investigate reports of illnesses, or collect rare ingredients. Fermenters might also work normal jobs as brewers, cheesemongers, cooks, and the like when they aren't doing secret work for the guild.",
								"Annual Members are tapped to become Fermenters if other members feel they could contribute to the guild's mission and a background investigation reveals no concerns. Senior members may ask candidates to perform a few \"simple tasks\" for the guild, tasks which end up testing their abilities when faced with danger. Promotion from Fermenter to Artisan is awarded for exceptional and reliable service to the guild and allows the agent to take on more dangerous missions. Once an Artisan proves themselves to the Directors as exceptionally talented and dedicated to the cause, they might themselves be elevated to Director, though this is rare.",
								"There are additional volunteer roles, such as Secretariat, Treasurer, and Chapter President, which are held by Fermenters, Artisans, or even Directors. These roles are typically administrative in nature and members are locally elected to these roles within their chapters every year (all members have a vote). While these representatives handle mundane matters in the chapters, major orders relating to the guild's secret mission come from the Directors, through the Artisans."

										"Disabilities are very much a part of our lives, but aren't what solely define a person. {@creature Aethelfaer|Ar7} does and should have interests as a fleshed-out character, with his disability making up only a part of who he is. As such, it's important to note that {@creature Aethelfaer|Ar7} enjoys hunting, whittling animals out of wood, and gathering plants and herbs to produce potions and tinctures he then sells or trades for supplies. He is knowledgeable in the horticulture of forests and grasslands, and is exceedingly fond of ravens and other corvids."
