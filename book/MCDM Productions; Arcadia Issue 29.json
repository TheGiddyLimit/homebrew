								"Thrilling. Terrifying. Wonderful. Novel. All those words describe what it feels like to explore. It's a big part of why so many people travel when they take a vacation—to experience the magic of discovery. Heck, I get goosebumps whenever I try a new food, hike a new path, or discover a new book to read. To me, all of that is exploration.",
								"Discovery is a big part of the reason we embrace roleplaying games. Characters always want to know what's behind the next door, inside the next chest, over the next hill, across the ocean, or even beyond the stars. At levels both grand and minuscule, our RPG main characters are constantly making discoveries, so that we as players experience all the thrill of exploration and fighting monsters without any of the life-threatening risks. ",
								"Players aren't the only ones who savor this excitement, though. As GMs, we are also constantly making discoveries. Before a session even begins, we discover things about our NPCs, dungeons, and worlds as we prepare. But for many of us, the biggest surprises come as we play with others. A player asks a question about why, when, where, or how something in the campaign came to be, and suddenly a whole new story presents itself. Your players can also provide you with the thrill of discovery more directly, as when they do something you never expected that causes the story to change, or sprinkle in bits of backstory about their characters. That's all discovery, baby!",
								"Even the dice are agents of exploration. They determine which random encounter gets inserted into the story, what treasure lies at the end of a dungeon, and if the ranger notices a secret door. Most roleplaying games have these tools for randomization because the chance to take action in the face of failure's risk and the uncertainty of adventures are what make these games a delight to play.",
								"RPGs, then, are collaborative exploration. The players, the GM, and the randomizers all come together to surprise and delight everyone involved, in a way that could never happen if one person or a small group were simply writing a story without the game.",
								"This issue of {@i ARCADIA} helps a GM run exploration-focused encounters. First, “What Lies Beneath” from {@link Indrani Ganguly|https://x.com/nonagondice} brings you incredible deep-sea creatures inspired by South Asian mythologies. By its nature, underwater adventuring is focused on exploration because of how much there is to discover beneath the waves. But this article also brings you three amazing creatures with unique lore to help expand your understanding of the depths. Then you can set sail on a story that takes place on the water's surface and in the sky above, with {@link Bianca Bickford's|https://x.com/BiancaBickford} “A Spirit Across Seas and Stars.” This story outline presents the framework for a globe-trotting adventure in which characters must unravel a mystery to repair a sapient flying boat. Finally, {@link Chris Bissette's|https://loottheroom.uk/links} “Dungeon Invasions” taps into the horror side of exploration with three unique creatures who can serve as villains who pop up as the characters explore a ruin, cave, or other site. This article reminded me so much of the greatest villains in a Resident Evil or Soulsborne game.",
                                "We hope that this issue, like every issue of {@i ARCADIA}, takes you to places you didn't know were there.",
                                "Also, you probably noticed that it's me, James, writing this letter and not the incredibly talented Hannah Rose. Hannah no longer works full-time at MCDM, but while she was here, she commissioned and developed some of the best articles this publication has ever had, including this issue and the next. Hannah also put in a lot of time and expertise developing the MCDM Tabletop Safety Toolkit, creatures for Flee, Mortals! and the core rules of the upcoming MCDM RPG. I am so grateful for her hard work. Thank you for making our games and community fun.",

What legends do fishers speak of, and what spoils do pirates hope to find? To answer these questions and more, let us turn to South Asian mythologies—Buddhist, Hindu, and Newar stories—for inspiration, and bring three unique aquatic creatures to your game.",

Mistrustful of outsiders, these muscular beasts have wide, murky-green, scaly bodies twice as long as a grown human is tall. However, makara are chimeric creatures, their features typically half terrestrial and half aquatic. Some might have long snouts that extend into a trunk offset with ivory tusks. Others might sport a serpentine body, stag horns, and feline claws. But the true beauty of all makara lies in their tails, which always have regional flora growing on them.",
                                "Although it can be challenging to gain the trust of a makara, it is not impossible. When domesticated, they make excellent guards for treasures, temples, and palaces. Once they choose to bond with a place or a person, they are protective and loyal till their last breath. However, attempting to force a makara into subservience is a surefire way of invoking their wrath.",

A mist fills the air—then takes the form of hot blood erupting from the widening portal as a figure steps through it. A lithe humanoid is dressed head to toe in layered gowns the color of old blood, and dripping with fresh viscera. What little skin is exposed is pale and shiny, a mass of scars and ill-healed wounds. The horrid creature rolls its shoulders, lazily swings two long, curving blades in crescents through the air, then fixes you with a pair of dark, cat-like eyes.",
