						"{@b The world of} Symbaroum is waiting for you and your friends\u2013a world of clashing cultures and ideals, a world of mystery and adventure, a world constantly on the verge of being swallowed by the darkness of the Eternal Night. To be frank, this may not sound very welcoming, but with so much at stake it is a place where you and your friends can actually make a difference, and have lots of fun and excitement doing so. Also, in the world of Symbaroum, no one dictates what type of difference you ought to make\u2013what goals to strive for, what friends (and, in turn, enemies) to make, and what means to employ in the struggle, is totally up to you!",
						"The {@i Symbaroum Setting Handbook} has been exclusively composed for the D&D Beyond platform, and offers a rules-free presentation of the game world featured in the Symbaroum RPG. The content has been gathered from several manuals belonging to two gamelines with different rulesets\u2013the original Symbaroum system and {@i Ruins of Symbaroum} 5e\u2013and assembled into a comprehensive guide that we hope will inspire gaming groups to set out on new, wondrously dark adventures. To do so, the Gamemaster has some work ahead, interpreting the book's guidelines in terms of actual rules and stats. But hopefully this will not prove much more challenging than adapting any published manual or adventure to the preferences of your group and the competence level of their player characters.",
						"This book is divided into three sections with three distinctly different aims. The {@book first|RuinsOfSymbaroumSettingHandbook|1} depicts the game world as seen from within, by the very people wandering its winding wilderness trails or cobblestone streets. In other words, it is written to be read by both the players and Gamemaster, and meant to give the former a basic understanding of the setting and its main settlements\u2013Thistle Hold, Karvosti and Yndaros\u2013as if their characters had lived there for some time. The rather superficial description is intended to make them feel at home, thereby giving them knowledge and tools to take the initiative in problem-solving situations. Of course, it is also important for Gamemasters to familiarize themselves with the facade, as this will prove vital when revealing the truth behind various misconceptions and lies to the players and their characters. Finally, the last chapter of the opening section is entitled {@book Folks|RuinsOfSymbaroumSettingHandbook|1}, and provides an introduction to the (playable) people inhabiting the game world: Humans, Elves and Dwarves, but also Changellings, Goblins, and the hulking Ogres.",
						"The {@book second section|RuinsOfSymbaroumSettingHandbook|1} offers insights into what goes on beneath the surface, and should not be shown to the players. It delves deep into the ancient history of the main game setting, and also accounts for more recent events linked to the three abovementioned settlements. In addition, you will find ten or more plot hooks for each of the settlements, ready to be developed into full-fledged adventures in accordance with the preferences of your gaming group. Before the section rounds off with an in-game report describing the landmass surrounding the main setting, there are two shorter chapters: one that introduces the otherworldly realms called the Underworld, Yonderworld, and Spirit World; and one that offers a brief portrayal of the pantheon of the (outlawed) Young Gods.",
						"The {@book final section|RuinsOfSymbaroumSettingHandbook|2} of the book is devoted to what is arguably the most common type of adventure in the world of Symbaroum: expeditions into the dark and exceedingly vast forest of Davokar. Guidelines for traveling in the forest are followed by event and treasure tables, specifically designed to mirror the lore and particular nature of said forest. You will also find tables for randomly creating forest ruins, and detailed advice on how to design different types of expeditions to mirror what goals and aspirations the players have set for their characters.",
						"To accompany the guidelines for expeditions, you will find eight adventure locations at the end of this book, complete with background, conflicts, maps, and a colorful gallery of non-player characters. The latter are presented without stat blocks, but with descriptions and tactics to use as inspiration and guidance when creating stats of your own (or when picking them from some relevant source). As for the locations in general, they can be played as one-shot adventures, used as the basis of a treasure hunt campaign, or as random encounters during the characters' journeys in the region.",
						"We hope you will enjoy exploring the world of Symbaroum\u2013a world where you get to explore the vast Forest of Davokar in the hunt for treasure, insights, and fame; where you may visit one of the eleven barbarian clans to trade or plunder their treasuries; where you can establish a base of power among princes, guilds, or rebellious refugees in the capital city of Yndaros; where you can fight for the honor of Queen Korinthia or ally yourselves with the ancient guardians of the forest. Whichever path you choose to walk, unforgettable adventures are waiting behind every crest and bend.",

The sorrow that blackens our hearts will be delivered in tears of hope and joy, not of grief and despair. We shall harvest the fruits of earth and forests, we shall harness the force of rivers and mountains, we will rise higher than ever before. To the pleasure of Prios we shall ascend to a place where there are no shadows, where darkness is no more. Because we are the people of Korinthia Nightbane and we will never be vanquished!"

What may be found outside this region will become the topic of future modules, although some information has been included here\u2013not least about Alberetor, the land south of the Titans which the Ambrian people have been forced to abandon.",
						"The reason for zooming in on a limited geographical area is that we are aiming for a presentation which is comprehensive rather than shallow, nuanced rather than sweeping. That being said, you will still find blanks and gaps in the text, topics we have been forced to exclude because of space limitations. But we hope and trust that the included material will prove to be enough for you to fill in the blanks yourself.",
						"Below you will find information on the setting's history, geography, population, and most powerful factions. You will also find a presentation of what can arguably be described as the heart of the game world, the forest of Davokar, followed by an introduction to its most important settlements: Ambria's capital city of Yndaros, the town of Thistle Hold, and the forest plateau Karvosti where the High Chieftain of the clanfolks resides.",
						"With the texts, images and maps of this section at your disposal, we hope that you will feel welcomed to the setting of Symbaroum. We would also like to invite you to contribute to its expansion. It is when this book reaches its readers that Ambria and Davokar truly begin to live and breathe, and we hope that you are willing to share your ideas, thoughts and creations with the Symbaroum community. In this way, the improvement and development of the setting can become our joint venture!",

								"{@b The Great War}, the hungry hordes of the Dark Lords\u2013a nightmare that lasted for two decades and which left little to hearten those who finally woke up. Instead they had all the reasons to grieve: tens of thousands had died; the maimed and broken were beyond count; the land was ravaged by death magic; there was famine and infertility. And even though the young {@book Queen|RuinsOfSymbaroumSettingHandbook|1|Queen Korinthia} had been rescued from the claws of the enemy, she had returned a shadow of her former self, with a lifeless mask covering her once radiant sunshine smile.",
								"Twenty-one years have passed since the Dark Lords were vanquished and the Queen realized that her realm was dying. She was forced to lead her people to safer grounds, that much was evident. And before long she was able to identify where to start anew. North of the mountain range called the Titans lay the fertile soils which according to legend were the ancestral home of her people. The time had come for Korinthia to claim her birthright.",
								"During the past couple of centuries the region up north had been controlled by warring, {@book barbarian clans|RuinsOfSymbaroumSettingHandbook|1|The Barbarian Clans} and before that by the prosperous city-state of Lindaros. According to legend, Lindaros suffered the wrath of celestial powers, causing a most infectious bleeder's disease to wipe out its entire population. This occurred about two hundred years ago, after which more than a century passed before the nomadic clans of the region dared approach the contaminated ruins.",
								"No more than a couple of months after the decisive battle against the Dark Lords, Korinthia's troops reached the region in the north. At Lindaros they encountered a small barbarian settlement, established by the clan Kadiz that had been evicted from its territory in {@book Davokar|RuinsOfSymbaroumSettingHandbook|1|Davokar} fifty years earlier. After a siege that lasted only three days the barbarian chieftain bowed before the superior power and the work of rebuilding Lindaros began in earnest\u2013a task that mainly was carried out by thousands of prisoners of war and as many so-called volunteers, men and women who were on the run from already dead regions in old Alberetor.",
								"The Queen did not join the refugees until seven years after the war's end. When she did, she declared that her new realm would be called Ambria, \"the shining,\" and the increasingly well-organized capital was to be named {@book Yndaros|RuinsOfSymbaroumSettingHandbook|5} in honor of Korinthia's father, the hero king Ynedar. Three years later the Queen's armies also managed to overwhelm the barbarian warlord Haloban and his clan warriors\u2013a triumph giving Korinthia and her people the opportunity to start exploring and harvesting the ample riches of Davokar Forest.",
								"Much has happened over a short period of time, so there has been no room for subtleties. Disobedient barbarians have been killed, banished or imprisoned by Korinthia's experienced and well-equipped soldiers; the obedient ones have been used for labor under slave-like conditions. The latter also holds true for many of Korinthia's own subjects, namely all those who came from the south without personal riches or sought-after skills. If anyone bothered to keep count of how many people have died in the process of building Ambria the final tally would be in the thousands. But no one does. To those who are alive nothing counts but the remarkable result. Although the restoration of Yndaros is far from finished the city has grown to enormous proportions, and at the same time Korinthia's knights have conquered all the land between the mountains in the south and the woods in the north. Now the nobles of Ambria are starting to plan for new conquests, in the north and in the west.",
								"Seven years ago the uncrowned king of Ambria's treasure-hunters, Lasifor Nightpitch, established the town of {@book Thistle Hold|RuinsOfSymbaroumSettingHandbook|2}. The construction was largely financed by the reward Lasifor had received for an armful of dried Twilight-Thistle\u2013a rare herb, allegedly powerful enough to aid the gravely ill Abesina, mother of Queen Korinthia. Ever since then, the walled settlement of Mayor Nightpitch has acted as a safe haven for Ambrians exploring Davokar, a forest full of natural resources and rich remnants of long lost civilizations; also a forest full of rampant abominations, dark-minded creatures of otherworldly origins and a band of wardens most unwilling to tolerate the damages done by human explorers."

								"{@b The region Korinthia} is determined to conquer is dominated by {@book Davokar|RuinsOfSymbaroumSettingHandbook|1|Davokar}, a forest that in itself is as varied as a continent. Traversing the woods from {@book Thistle Hold|RuinsOfSymbaroumSettingHandbook|2} to its northern edge would take weeks, if not months, and on the way one would have to face beasts as well as hostile elves, blight-stricken abominations and treacherous nature.",
								"South of Davokar a rolling landscape of fertile plains stretches out. Where they are not plowed by Ambrian farmers they are covered by pale green grass or small groves where the birds and beasts of the lowlands find shelter. This is Ambria, a kingdom divided into seven duchies encircling an eighth domain ruled by the {@book Church of Prios|RuinsOfSymbaroumSettingHandbook|1|The Church of Prios}, the Sun God and the Giver of Laws. The Grand Duchy of Korinthia is by far the largest, just as the capital city of {@book Yndaros|RuinsOfSymbaroumSettingHandbook|5} is larger than Thistle Hold, Ravenia and the high seat of the Sun Church, Templewall.",

Aside from some mining colonies and the monastery of the Twilight Friars south of Yndaros, the Ambrians are yet to establish any noteworthy settlements in the mountains. Instead they have become a refuge for robbers, free-thinkers and rebellious barbarians. And as for the dwarven realm of Küam Zamok, its inhabitants appear to be totally indifferent to humans, with the exception of the few families that, for reasons unknown but wildly debated, have settled down in Yndaros.",
								"The climate is colder and more humid compared to what the Ambrians are used to. Damp winds from the southern oceans climb over the Titans and are not embarrassed to drown Ambria in heavy rains, especially during the autumn. The winters are cold, with snow covering the streets of Yndaros for a month or two, or even longer during the winters that the barbarians call Istaros, when arctic winds sweep down from the north, so cold that hearths which are allowed to go out can barely be brought back to life and the blood freezes in anyone who dares venture outside for longer than it takes to collect more firewood.",

										"In broad terms {@book Davokar|RuinsOfSymbaroumSettingHandbook|1|Davokar} and its surroundings are inhabited by three distinct groups of people\u2013{@book Ambrians|RuinsOfSymbaroumSettingHandbook|1|Ambrian}, {@book barbarians|RuinsOfSymbaroumSettingHandbook|1|Barbarian} and the Elder Folks (for instance {@book elves|RuinsOfSymbaroumSettingHandbook|1|Elves}, {@book goblins|RuinsOfSymbaroumSettingHandbook|1|Goblins} and {@book ogres|RuinsOfSymbaroumSettingHandbook|1|Ogres}). If you were to ask any single representative of one of those groups about such classifications he would probably feel uncomfortable being lumped in with individuals that to him appear as more or less strange. But that does not alter the fact that there are some shared characteristics within those groups which make the categories justifiable.",
										"The Ambrians all stem from the dead realm Alberetor south of the Titans. The Great War has made them tough but also forced them to become disciplined and organized, in terms of the military and bureaucracy as well as regarding trade and divisions of labor. In short: the war has civilized the Ambrians as a people, even though it may have brutalized many of its individuals.",
										"The Ambrians are capable and experienced when it comes to waging wars, but they are also characterized by a profound spirituality and an aptitude for refined skills and nuanced knowledge. Other than that you will find a common quality in their ambitions: they are a people bent on conquest and ownership; they always strive for more and better, whatever it concerns. Nature is regarded as a resource, filled with supplies which can make life more comfortable, or in any case more tolerable, and many Ambrians would willingly risk life and limb in the hope of finding treasure, knowledge or rare goods which could secure them a comfortable future.",
										"When it comes to the {@book barbarian clans|RuinsOfSymbaroumSettingHandbook|1|The Barbarian Clans} they actually live in greater harmony since the arrival of the Ambrians. It is commonly accepted that the clan folks are descendants of Symbaroum, the civilization that ruled the region up until a millennium ago. There are of course huge differences between the clans in terms of lifestyle and customs, but in the end they have much in common. What they share is probably best symbolized by the witches, the spiritual leaders of the clans and advisors to the chieftains. Under the guidance of the witches, the barbarians are fully aware that they are living in and consequently are depending on nature for their safety and survival. And they have all borne witness to what happens when one does not respect the taboos dictated by the Huldra, the head of all witches who lives on Karvosti alongside the High Chieftain.",
										"Finally there is the vague category called the Elder Folks, including elves, dwarves, goblins, trolls, ogres, changelings and others. A majority of the individuals sorted under this label tend to see themselves as nature's children, rather than its owners or rulers. There are of course exceptions, not least among the goblins who have gotten a taste of Ambrian abundance and even more evident among the dwarven families living in Yndaros.",
										"But by and large, the Ambrians and the Elder Folks are very dissimilar in this respect. The disagreement, not to say animosity, is most apparent in the conflicts between Korinthia's subjects and the elves of Davokar. With reference to a treaty that supposedly was signed by many human lords around the time of Symbaroum's fall, the wardens of the woods demand that all Ambrians stay clear of the forest. They even claim that an ancient alliance called the {@book Iron Pact|RuinsOfSymbaroumSettingHandbook|1|The Iron Pact} gives them the right to slay any human who violates the terms of the treaty\u2013a claim that Korinthia and her knights scoff at and which no dedicated treasure-hunter takes seriously."

										"Much changed in the wake of The Great War. The most radical change was when the sun god {@book Prios|RuinsOfSymbaroumSettingHandbook|14|Prios} went from being one of many accepted deities to being recognized as the One. Where the Dark Lords represented darkness and death, Prios came to symbolize the light of Alberetor and the life-giving power of the sun. Or as {@book Jeseebegai|RuinsOfSymbaroumSettingHandbook|1|First Father Jeseebegai}, the current First Father of the {@book Sun Church|RuinsOfSymbaroumSettingHandbook|1|The Church of Prios}, has expressed it: {@i \"In the abyss, in absolute darkness, was the spark which gave hope to the world, the spark which in the care of we Ambrians will make Prios blaze as never before.\"}",
										"Today Prios is recognized as the Giver of Laws or as the One, and almost all Ambrians adhere to His commandments, as conveyed by the priests and theurgs of the Sun Church. Prios is said to be everywhere beneath the heavens and humans are tasked with cultivating His creation. Sadly, man has neglected this duty for a long time, which in turn means that Prios has lost much of His strength, so much in fact that He is dying. But according to the sermons there is still hope. If humans strive to correct the error of their ways\u2013if they work harder, extract more crops from the soil, harvest more and richer resources from forests and mountains, colonize more of the wilds\u2013then Prios will grow strong again.",
										"In the quest to honor and strengthen the Sun God, Davokar has a vital role to play. The wild, unruly forest is considered to be the perfect example of what happens when humans refrain from doing what they are obliged to do. Davokar must be cleansed, its potency disciplined and its resources cultivated. It is to advance that quest that the Curia, the high council of the Sun Church, sends missionaries as well as explorers to the depths of Davokar, and why they already have established a temple on Karvosti, the age-old Thingstead of the barbarian clans.",
										"In the shadow of Prios the abolished deities live on, gods that actually bear a striking resemblance to the deities of the clans. Concerning the religious beliefs of the barbarian folks, many theurgs and learned masters have tried to describe and categorize the gods, spirits and divine beings worshiped in Davokar. So far they have not succeeded. Evidently the clans are very dissimilar when it comes to how they relate to spiritual powers. As mentioned, some worship deities similar to the gods banished by the Ambrians. For instance, the serpent god Uron revered by the {@book Gaoia clan|RuinsOfSymbaroumSettingHandbook|1|Gaoia} shares features with the {@book Ambrian Earthmother|RuinsOfSymbaroumSettingHandbook|14|The Earthmother}; the {@book Baiaga clan's|RuinsOfSymbaroumSettingHandbook|1|Baiaga} bloodwolf Arex is clearly related to the {@book Ambrian Pathfinder|RuinsOfSymbaroumSettingHandbook|14|The Pathfinder}; and the spider Oroke, who is worshiped by many, has some qualities in common with {@book the Executioner|RuinsOfSymbaroumSettingHandbook|14|The Executioner}. But among the clans you will also find worship of ancestors, holy grounds, beasts and sheer monstrosities like the bestial Blood-Daughter of the {@book clan Saar-Kahn|RuinsOfSymbaroumSettingHandbook|1|Saar-Kahn}. Regarding religious rituals there are also great discrepancies between the clans, from collective prayer sessions to downright deadly customs\u2013as when the members of {@book clan Enoai|RuinsOfSymbaroumSettingHandbook|1|Enoai} allow themselves to be bitten by venomous spiders, in order to get closer to Oroke.",
										"The Elder Folks appear to have a more relaxed approach to spiritual matters. Instead of worshiping or praying to divine beings they seem content with showing gratitude towards the spirits which, according to them, inhabit all aspects of nature. They give thanks to the stream for letting them traverse the rapid waters unharmed. They offer their gratitude to the hazel for letting its nuts fall to the ground. They whisper thank you to the deer for allowing itself to get trapped. It is said that Elori, the elven emissary in {@book Yndaros|RuinsOfSymbaroumSettingHandbook|5}, was asked about his beliefs during a visit to Queen Korinthia's court. His exact response is obviously only known to those present, but according to rumor he replied with an insult: {@i \"It is a vain presumption to think that the world would care about being worshiped or that it would listen to prayers; it is a presumption which mirrors man's own desire to be worshiped and his expectation that he can force his will upon the world.\"}"

										"Ambrians as well as barbarians are storytellers. The barbarian folk value a good narrator almost as highly as a skilled warrior, and the {@book High Chieftain|RuinsOfSymbaroumSettingHandbook|1|High Chieftain Tharaban} on Karvosti always has one or two select storytellers living in his fortress. These chroniclers are often chosen from among the participants of the annual contest held during the market days at the autumn equinox, and are considered to have a special responsibility for remembering and recounting historical events.",
										"Aside from the telling of stories, the leisurely activities of the clans tend to involve weapon games and rituals paying homage to nature. It would probably be misguided to describe the clans' relationship to Davokar in terms of worship, but under the guidance of the witches all barbarians are careful to show gratitude towards the forest that feeds them and teaches them humility. In that, as in most other cases, the storytellers play a vital role\u2013especially when it comes to cautionary tales that account for what may happen if one violates the taboos dictated by {@book the Huldra|RuinsOfSymbaroumSettingHandbook|1|The Huldra Yeleta}.",
										"Among Ambrians storytelling takes many different forms. The bards and poets who perform in taverns, restaurants and inns are very popular, but the same can be said about prominent actors, dancers and artists. Within all these art forms portrayals of The Great War are common. Tales about individuals who have pleased Prios, so-called Lightbringers or Martyrs, is another popular theme. However, in recent years a newcomer has appeared on the Ambrian stage: tales of Davokar\u2013of fortune-hunters who have found their fortune; of heroic encounters with arch trolls and lindworms; of rich treasure chambers found in overgrown ruins. Additionally, the Ambrian storytellers have made it their business to visit their barbarian colleagues to learn popular stories from them, including the ancient poems attributed to the legendary Huldra Aroaleta.",
										"Aside from the Ambrians making use of more forms of storytelling, there is another significant difference between the groups: while almost all barbarians take part in the rites of the witches and listen to tales told around the fire, the Ambrian people are divided into a number of sub-groups. The nobles have their own venues for dance, theater and music, and love to cover their walls in grandiose tapestries with themes from battles or nature. Merchants and craftsmen often visit the same salons, where they place themselves according to fortune and status since the prices vary depending on where you sit. Free, laboring Ambrians listen to tales told in the taverns while thralls, serfs and commoners in the countryside have to settle for the tall tales told by their elders as they assemble for the evening meal. Of course there are exceptions, but the principle can hardly be questioned: the subjects of Korinthia are undoubtedly stratified in terms of both assets and interests."

										"Given that the three main populations in the region have such a disparate relationship to {@book Davokar|RuinsOfSymbaroumSettingHandbook|1|Davokar}, you would probably conclude that the Ambrians always collide with the Elder Folks, and that the barbarians are caught somewhere in between. Of course it is not as simple as that. There are lots of individuals who do not fit that mold\u2013Ambrians who join the elves in their ambition to keep Davokar in peace as well as single barbarians, elves, changelings and ogres who have made their homes in Ambria.",
										"Nevertheless, the general climate of the region is one of open conflicts, characterized by the Ambrian ambition to explore and exploit Davokar and the Elder Folks' reluctance to let them do so. Presently, Queen Korinthia's people seem to be the unchallenged rulers of the plains between the mountains and the forest, and it would probably take an all-embracing pact of barbarians and elves to change that. But in the woods the balance of power is more even. The Queen's army has a hard time functioning with full efficiency in the forest, while local knowledge and experience provide their counterparts with a great advantage. Furthermore, the Ambrians have a hard time confronting the horrors of Davokar on a unified front. Special interests linked to factions, blood or personal gain are often given priority at the expense of the common good, not least when it comes to managing and distributing information, resources and treasure found in the woods.",
										"The latter also paves the way for joint ventures involving a mixture of Ambrians, barbarians and others. Instead of contacting factions like {@book Ordo Magica|RuinsOfSymbaroumSettingHandbook|1|Ordo Magica} or the {@book Queen's Rangers|RuinsOfSymbaroumSettingHandbook|1|The Queen's Army}, many dukes and barons have initiated collaborations with barbarian or goblin chieftains. And the wizards, scholars and Rangers tend to act in a similar fashion\u2013better to pay the locals for help than to divide any profit or advances with other Ambrians. The only exception from this is the {@book Sun Church|RuinsOfSymbaroumSettingHandbook|1|The Church of Prios}, whose representatives are unwilling to mix with the \"creatures of the night\". On the other hand, they engage in missionary campaigns and can in that way utilize the knowledge and skills of converted goblins, barbarians and ogres.",
										"In other words, to give a clear cut and straightforward account of the relationship between the peoples of the region is both difficult and fundamentally misleading. In order to understand how collaborations, quarrels and armed conflicts arise you have to take a large number of factors into account, not least the factions described in the upcoming chapter. Moreover, you must understand that in light of the escalating threat from the corrupt powers of Davokar, basic necessity may require the most unlikely alliances to be forged."

										"Ambria, as Alberetor before it, is a hierarchical society, for centuries governed by an assembly of noble families, called houses. The families are ranked based on their position in the order of succession, and the rank affects what offices their representatives may hold.",
										"Ambria is divided into seven duchies, in turn divided into smaller domains, called counties or baronies depending on their size. Formally, it is the Queen who appoints dukes, who then appoints counts and barons to manage subjects and land. But there have been lots of exceptions from that order of things. For instance the Queen may nominate individuals to the title Prince of the Realm\u2013a position which gives its owner a duke's power over a smaller piece of land. It is also rumored that the Queen on a couple of occasions has appointed counts against the will of the concerned duke and that some of the counts command such authority that the people in the region show him more respect than they grant the official ruler of the duchy.",
										"Ranked first among the noble families is the royal {@book House of Kohinoor|RuinsOfSymbaroumSettingHandbook|1|Kohinoor}, personified by Korinthia Nightbane and five of Ambria's six dukes, all of them closely related to the Queen. That may sound like a harmonious affair, but according to gossip and campfire tales there are circumstances which complicate the situation. That the Queen's mother married a new husband, bore him the daughter Esmerelda and then fell gravely ill is one of those; that Korinthia's only living uncle is bitter that he missed his chance at the throne is another.",
										"Furthermore, when the Queen's cousins are said to be incompetent bordering on useless and when the other houses long for an opportunity to dethrone the Kohinoors, anyone can see that Korinthia has had to reexamine the situation carefully before appointing the dukes of the Promised Land.",
										"On the other hand, one should not believe everything one hears. Provided that appearances are not tremendously deceiving, the rule of Ambria works as it should. There is steady progress in the development of the regions, the army stands firm in the face of Davokar's abominations and new colonies are established every other month.

The cautious spring elves apparently love nothing better than to subject human wanderers to all kinds of more or less deadly mischief, while the hot-headed summer elves are happy to use the same travelers as targets for their perfectly aimed arrows\u2013not least if they are in, or are traveling toward, areas deemed especially sensitive by the wardens.",
										"Finally some words about the ruins of the outskirts. The southern regions and the area surrounding Karvosti have already been thoroughly explored by the Queen's Rangers, Ordo Magica's expeditions and independent fortune-hunters, leading to the discovery of sites like Serand's Pyramid, the Columns of Haganor and the grand aqueducts of Clearwell. But that does not mean that there is nothing more to unearth. Even today, the lucky and well-prepared may still find untouched ruins close to the southern border. And if one dares to venture further north or to delve deeper down into the soil, the chance of interesting discoveries is multiplied."

										"Beyond the elusive border which Mallianos has established between bright and dark, there are regions that should not be traversed without great care, detailed preparations and a sizable company of sword-wielding companions. In contrast to the outskirts, the depths are riddled with grave dangers and there are neither barbarians, nor Ranger patrols that can come to your rescue. In short: one never ventures into the dark of Davokar without being prepared to risk one's life in the hope of gaining riches, knowledge or fame.",
										"According to Mallianos, Dark Davokar is characterized by dense and wild vegetation that closes out all light. Here the flaws of the Duality Principle are revealed\u2013the few fortune-hunters who have traveled into the dark and returned with their health and minds intact testify that the sunbeams actually do reach the ground in there. They can also tell you that this certainly does not mean that the horrors go away.",
										"Whatever is true or false when it comes to the many postulates by Mallianos, there are reports speaking of a very devious nature in Davokar's inner regions, a nature whose threats lurk where one would least expect\u2013threats in the form of bottomless streams, tiny but poisonous creatures, overgrown sinkholes and carnivorous or bloodthirsty vines. There is also talk of infections and parasites which make their victims insane, paralyzed, rabid or undead; of ancient curses with similar effects; even of areas defying all reason, where it snows in the summer, where plants shimmer from some inner glow and where nightmares inexplicably come to life. But neither Mallianos, nor Lukresia, nor some other authority on the nature of Davokar can claim to actually know which of these statements correspond with reality. If any.",
										"The truth is just as uncertain when it comes to the inhabitants of the deep. That there are raving abominations, beastly rage trolls and packs of tricklestings and hunger wolves may be concluded from the stories told by returning explorers. And maybe there is some truth to the rumors about a predatory and bloodthirsty barbarian clan, even if credible evidence of their existence is yet to be found. But when there is talk about shapeshifting creatures of otherworldly origins, bone-pale elf warriors, possessed mastodons and cunning dragons, the testimonies are far fewer and even less reliable.",
										"The same goes for the barbarian stories about shadowy beings like Lord Bog and the Hawthorn Hag, ancient creatures who, according to legend, are as powerful as they are wrathful. The problem is that those who come across the residents of the forest do not often get the opportunity to return with their tales. And a majority of the lucky ones return in a state which makes it hard to believe what they have to say.",
										"What drives Ambrian explorers to defy the dangers is of course the hope of finding treasures from the days of Symbaroum. Mallianos makes no effort to hide the fact that the further into Davokar you travel, the greater is your chance of finding well-preserved and rich ruins. But he also points out that, first, the ruins of the Dark are often overgrown or hard to find since all that remains is below ground; second, that they always are inhabited by someone or something ready to protect its turf. And even if one should take this \"always\" with a pinch of salt, reports from both the Rangers and Ordo Magica suggest that his warnings are warranted.",
										"On the other hand, venturing into the Dark may still be worth the risk. Judging by the fortune salvaged by {@book Iasogoi Brigo|RuinsOfSymbaroumSettingHandbook|2|The Triumph of Iasogoi} during one single visit to the ruins of Odaban, one who finds the path to places like Saroklaw, Dakovak or even {@book Symbar|RuinsOfSymbaroumSettingHandbook|1|Symbar} will hardly return empty handed.

However, it does not take more than a couple of days and nights before it becomes obvious that this apparent idyll comes at a price.",

And as soon as the villain emerges onto the Southern Highroad, they are forever banned from even visiting the Hold.",

When you hear someone say that {@i \"Thistle Hold lives in the shadows\"} this is what they mean\u2013under cover of darkness, in alleys and nooks, behind closed doors and shutters thrives that which would never be allowed under clear blue skies.

												"Most people believe that Queen Korinthia had managed to persuade some members of the clan to betray their master by sabotaging the gates of the fortress, but other stories attribute the sabotage to the heroic actions of a group of Queen's Rangers. And regarding the clan's destruction, several diverse stories are told. Some say that also women and children died fighting, others that most Jezites went up in flames with the hall where they were hiding, and there are even those who maintain that the clan members died in a mass suicide.",
												"No matter what one believes, the annihilation of the Jezites meant the end of the barbarian presence on the southern plains. Haloban's fortress was demolished so that no one would try to recapture it, and after that the area surrounding the ancient bronze well lay desolate for over two years, until Lasifor Nightpitch initiated his grandiose construction project."

								"{@i The Huldra was a voice, a bone-white mask and two embers that flared hotter than both the fire and the eyes of the Cryptwalker. \"How dare you?\" The question was an accusation, as if I was guilty of unspeakable crimes. \"It is not a lone bear that sleeps, whose fur you unwittingly tug at; it is all bears and all other beings to add; a slumbering horde fed on anger and shame.

Yes, songs are sung of Symbar, Saroklaw, and the mythical Dakovak. Yet, unlike these fabled places and others like them, Karvosti is very much alive\u2013and what is more, it is the home of many renowned individuals.",
								"Many people, barbarians and Ambrians alike, fantasize about what life is like up there amongst wrathguards, sun priests and witches; how it would feel to stand on the plateau and behold the mighty forest below. Very few ever get the opportunity to actually set foot on the cliff. Usually, such a visit would require a difficult and perilous journey through monster-infested woods, and a lengthy absence from one's crops or whatever means of livelihood one might have. Hence, apart from its small number of permanent residents and members of the delegations sporadically sent by the clans, Karvosti is visited almost exclusively by people with nothing to lose or live for.",
								"Sure, there are exceptions\u2013meticulously organized expeditions arranged by explorers or fortune hunters who are using Karvosti as a base of operations, or have planned a brief stay on the cliff to rest and re-provision. These may be groups led by Ordo Magica, the Black Cloaks, or possibly some ambitious noble. Such visits tend to aggravate the already tense atmosphere on the cliff, for though the High Chieftain and the witches must accept the Ambrian presence, they do not look kindly on fortune hunters who violate the clanfolk's well-founded taboos. All too often, their fears are confirmed when the expeditions bring with them the darkness of the forest below\u2013as a result of shameful intrusions into some abominable creature's territory, or the theft of its treasures.",
								"This chapter is intended to reflect the first impressions of Karvosti, as experienced first-hand or recounted by Ambrian explorers. In other words, it is reasonable for players whose characters have spent time on the cliff, or who have socialized with seasoned fortune hunters in {@book Yndaros|RuinsOfSymbaroumSettingHandbook|5} or {@book Thistle Hold|RuinsOfSymbaroumSettingHandbook|2}, to have access to the following information.",

										"{@b Those who have} made their way up the cliff and reached the sturdy wall at the end of the slope are intercepted by a group of eleven wrathguards, who share little in common beyond the arms they carry and their red-tinted chainmail. Newcomers should not be surprised to be met by just a few guards, probably accompanied by {@book Lumedo|RuinsOfSymbaroumSettingHandbook|3|Lumedo the Interpreter}, the aged Ambrian who has been the wrathguards' interpreter these last four years. The remaining wrathguards are likely to throw them quick glances before redirecting their attention to the forest, looking for any movement that might signal an approaching threat.",
										"After having answered questions about the nature of their visit, and having their packs searched, the travelers are given some time to let the impressions sink in\u2013the High Chieftain's mighty fortress looming on the eastern edge of the plateau; the fault scarp, hundreds of feet further away, with its entrance to the witches' dwelling; the shiny copper dome of the {@book sun temple|RuinsOfSymbaroumSettingHandbook|3|Mass At The Sun Temple} perched on the upper ledge near the western precipice.",
										"Then there are the people. There seems to be only a few of them moving around, at the nearby marketplace and in the {@book pilgrim camp|RuinsOfSymbaroumSettingHandbook|3|Games at the Pilgrim Camp} below the sun temple. More of them are posted along the edges of the plateau, on the walls and towers of the stronghold, and by the sun temple. They are all looking outwards, at the forest, that dark and swaying sea of leaves. Or is it that they look for what is moving beneath the foliage? Karvosti may be an impressive cliff, but compared to Davokar it is both tiny and terribly exposed. It is imperative for people on the cliff\u2013residents and visitors alike\u2013to get along and assist one another.",
										"Initially, this feeling of solidarity is the predominant one. On Karvosti, everyone stands united against the darkness of Davokar, despite various disagreements and historical animosity. This is taken for granted, more out of necessity than anything else, and all present on the plateau are expected to do whatever it takes to avoid open conflict. Of course, this is easier said than done\u2013especially when situated on an isolated cliff deep within the forest, along with a colorful collection of rash and violent individuals with unwavering confidence in their convictions...",
										"One soon realizes that just about everyone on Karvosti must constantly bite their tongue with regards to the many perceived injustices\u2013some more serious than others. Suppressed, destructive feelings such as jealousy, suspicion, dislike, and pure hatred can be recognized on most faces\u2013in the exchange of glares between wrathguards and sun knights; in the hand reaching for the hilt of a sword when a merchant refuses to haggle; in the whispers behind the backs of newly arrived members of a successful expedition; even in the growing silence as a loving couple sneak into their tent. An inquisitive person may be told lots of grisly stories about times when such feelings could not be subdued\u2013often ending with the aggressive party being imprisoned, waiting to be judged by either the chieftain of their clan or the {@book Queen's legate|RuinsOfSymbaroumSettingHandbook|2|The Queen's Legation}.",
										"Other blemishes on the peaceful surface are the individuals suffering from physical and mental afflictions, something particularly apparent in the pilgrim camp. At night, the silence is often broken by anguished moans, hysterical screams, or mindless babble\u2013like a ghastly chorale; the spiritually diseased sometimes incite each other and the physically afflicted cry out their suffering, thinking their wails to be drowned out by the screams, laughs and chants of the insane. A recently deceased Master of the Order, Eulia Vearra, described the phenomenon as {@i \"the Karvosti Midnight Choir,\"} a phrase more or less deliberately misinterpreted in Yndaros and made synonymous with the allegedly wild feasts of the barbarian folk.",
										"Finally, there are the disappearances. After having arrived at the cliff, it will probably not be long before someone asks whether the traveler has met a certain person or two on the journey through the forest. It is difficult to estimate how many have disappeared, but rumors around the pilgrim camp and marketplace suggest the number to be at least a handful every moon. No one really knows the cause. It appears as if a majority of the lost ones were infected by some disease, and most likely threw themselves off the cliff, later to be dragged away by some hungering beast. There are also whispers claiming that the witches might have something to do with it, while others suspect that the ancient being Aloéna is responsible.",
										"At any rate, one cannot fail to marvel at the fact that such a great number of people have managed to disappear without a trace from a place like Karvosti.",

The former is about the height of five men, while the path itself is blocked by a stone wall, ten paces thick, with a pair of double gates of iron-fitted oak. The gates are usually open, with three wrathguards posted in the gateway. Another eight sentries are located either along the edges of the ravine or on the crenellated top of the wall, cast in shadow by the statues of two wild boars towering over them.",
												"The wrathguards on the ground proclaim, sometimes through an interpreter, that Karvosti is neutral ground. No creature is denied entrance, except those who are blight-marked or carry objects deemed dangerous to the other residents. Should there be any confusion on these issues, the witches are notified and one of them (usually the male witch Gadramon) comes down to inspect the person or object in question.",

Neither Tharaban nor the wrathguards are authorized to pass judgement on visitors who cause trouble or commit crimes\u2013they are all to be judged by the laws of their respective ruler. However, the wrathguards may use force to maintain peace on the plateau and have the right to detain suspects until they can be extradited to (if not judged on site by) the appropriate authority.

Not much is known regarding its early days, but legends suggest that it first housed a number of temples and that it later became a refuge when the civilization of Symbaroum began to crumble. An indication to back that assumption is that the temple ruin rebuilt by the {@book Sun Church|RuinsOfSymbaroumSettingHandbook|1|The Church of Prios} is evidently older than the magnificent stronghold of the High Chieftain.",
										"Whatever the truth may be, the barbarians have used the plateau for hundreds of years. Legends say it was the threatening hordes of the Spider King that five centuries ago caused the clans to appoint a common paramount leader and follow him into battle. The leader still exists but lost his authority as soon as the threat was taken care of. Like his predecessors the current High Chieftain, {@book Tharaban|RuinsOfSymbaroumSettingHandbook|1|High Chieftain Tharaban}, has no more power than what the clan leaders grant him, if and when they need him to mediate or adjudicate in particular disputes\u2013sometimes in peaceful negotiations, sometimes acting as judge when blood feuds must be settled through brutal duels.",
										"To aid him, Tharaban has Karvosti's witch node, spearheaded by the {@book Huldra Yeleta|RuinsOfSymbaroumSettingHandbook|1|The Huldra Yeleta}. Formally the witches are advisors in all affairs dealt with on the cliff, providing guidance based on their profound understanding of the clans and the people. However, persistent gossip maintains that they are more than that; that it is in fact the Huldra who leads the barbarians with Tharaban as her mouthpiece\u2013a notion which has become especially popular in Yndaro where skalds and minstrels fondly make use of Yeleta as the star of their more terrifying pieces.",
										"Five years ago, the High Chieftain and The Huldra were faced with their greatest challenge in centuries. It was Ambrian explorers who first discovered the sun-like symbols on the plateau's ancient temple ruin. They were followed, first by missionaries, later by heavily armored Sun Knights intent on cleansing the cliff of savages. The Templars attacked but were after a bloody day of combat driven back by the High Chieftain's Wrathguards. Long and trying negotiations ensued, that finally ended in an agreement by which the Church of Prios was given the right to both remain on Karvosti and to restore the temple ruin. At about the same time, Queen Korinthia sent the eldest son of {@book House Grendel|RuinsOfSymbaroumSettingHandbook|6|Grendel} to the cliff as her envoy.",
										"The exact reasons behind the outcome of the negotiations remain unclear, but apparently Karvosti's symbolic importance is not great enough for the clans to rally in its defense. In addition, there are many who claim that the High Chieftain and the Huldra to some extent can appreciate having the Ambrians around, as allies in the fight against the Dark of Davokar.",
										"In spite of the fact that Karvosti rests in the more open and brighter parts of the forest, it is not spared from encounters with corrupt monstrosities. Any barbarian can testify that the attacks from both beasts and abominations have grown more numerous over the past decade. Some whisper that the witches have foreseen such a development and that they are preparing for something called the Resurrection of Davokar. And even if the clanfolks tend to accuse the Ambrian people of having upset the woods, this may explain why the High Chieftain and the Huldra seek peaceful agreements instead of war. If Davokar truly awakens it may prove to be a bad thing to have hostile Templars, Pansars and Ambrian mystics at your back.",

Former Wrathguards never talk about their time of service, and most do not survive long after returning home\u2013a reality that no barbarian wants to discuss, but about which Ambrians enjoy speculating. Maybe there is some truth to what is said, that the Guard of the Slumbering Wrath is fed a special elixir that makes them extra powerful but which they have a hard time doing without once the duty is done."

At its midpoint is the entrance to the cavelike dwelling of the witch node, and should you follow the wall westwards you would soon arrive at a camp inhabited by pilgrims and other visitors to the temple.",
										"The quickest and easiest way to the upper level of the fault line runs through the witches' caves. But since they are reluctant to have their home used as a transit route, a provisional bridge made out of two gigantic pine trunks has been established next to the campsite. The temple itself rests by the upper bridgehead, and further than that people seldom have the need or longing to walk, because in the towering grove found at the southern tip of the cliff lives Aloéna\u2014a female being, ten feet tall and believed to be of elven offspring, who is said not to be very hospitable.",
										"The atmosphere on Karvosti is characterized by a nervous calm that sometimes turns into tense watchfulness. The general feeling is that the threat from Davokar's beasts and beings continues to grow, and adding to that is the constant mistrust between barbarians and representatives of the Sun Church. At times the calm is shattered\u2014a priest is attacked by harsh words or a thrown pebble on his way across the plateau; a lone Wrathguard encounters a similar situation while patrolling the camp site\u2014instances which make both groups fear the start of a revenge spiral. But as soon as Elven arrows start raining from the sky or the bronze bell of the stronghold warns about inbound beasts all past transgressions are forgotten and blood-red Wrathguards are seen fighting side-by-side with Templars in shining armor.",

Much of it has already been mapped and explored for treasures, as for instance the mighty Pyramid of Serand and the deep-reaching Earth Towers by the Black Leech Rift. But the further you travel from the cliff, the more likely you are to find untouched ruins. The barbarians regard all remnants of Symbaroum as taboo and are not happy to welcome treasure-hunters to the plateau carrying their finds with them.

The northern clans favored another candidate, the Saar Iaholas, and when the new high chieftain was nearly assassinated not long after his coronation, many blamed the northerners.

It was Sunflower who informed the Church of Prios of the sun symbols carved into the ruin, which sparked both the Queen's and the First Father's interest in the deeper parts of the forest.",

She came to power less than a year before Hohax's murder, no more than nineteen years old at the time. The Chieftain chose her over the older apprentice of the previous Keeper, and many Baiags would like to see this \"mistake\" rectified once a new Chieftain is elected. But Makaba is apparently unfazed by their threats\u2013perhaps she would not mind being replaced; perhaps she deems herself more powerful than her challenger, Garagor, and is not afraid to prove it in a mystical duel, should it come to that.",
												"The Elder, Bera, has a reputation for being stubborn and harsh, and lacking capacity for tolerance or mercy. The previous chieftain despised her, and the common folk are losing faith in her as well, not least since the views she represents (\"defend Arex's territory at all cost!\") are slowly losing ground. It would hardly come as a surprise to anyone if a future chieftain immediately called on his people to elect a new Elder to represent them, and Bera was defeated in that election.",
												"The three nominees most likely to succeed Hohax have little in common. The bear warrior Eradana demands that clan Baiaga adapt to the forest's altered conditions and form alliances with other clans, mainly Zarek and Godinja. Like Makaba, she wants to establish new taboos to stop people from visiting certain ruins and border regions, and prohibit the consumption of various plants and animals.",
												"Her main opponent is Karloar, a former wrathguard and fanatic traditionalist who wants the clan to cut all ties with the outside world and drive the darkness from Arex's territory by any means necessary. But even though many clan members share his isolationist views, it might not be enough to win him the title of chieftain. Like many homecoming wrathguards, Karloar is forever scarred by his time on Karvosti\u2013his trembling hands and voice, his violent mood swings and sometimes unquenchable thirst for drink cause some people to hesitate. His greatest chance of winning is said to lie in the third candidate's ability to sway large numbers of Eradana sympathizers. The tracker Tharama has a very similar vision for the clan, but has lived in Ambria for more than a decade and believes that the Baiaga should follow the Odav example and open their arms to their southern neighbor."

The clatter of construction sites is mixed with tramping hooves and boots, the luring calls of vendors, and a cacophony of general chatter.",
										"As soon as the shock wears off and the visitors can make sense of their new experiences, the contrasts become apparent: between new and old, stylish and simple, luxurious and cheap, Ambrian and barbarian. The contrasts can be seen in everything from people and how they dress, to buildings and monuments, to commodities and the songs played on street corners and in taverns. Compared to the human-dominated realm of Alberetor, the diversity is greater still, thanks to the ogres, goblins, elves, and dwarves residing in the capital. Individuals accustomed to other Ambrian cities need days to acclimatize; those who have never known anything but the villages of the countryside may find the impressions downright unbearable.",
										"Another clear difference from the realm's other settlements is the high level of security. The spear-wielding patrols of the {@book City Watch|RuinsOfSymbaroumSettingHandbook|5|The City Watch} are ever present, often accompanied by one or two younger Pansars; almost all taverns, shops, temples, and inns have armed guards posted at the entrance, and it is not at all uncommon for people to move through the city with a bodyguard or two. One soon learns that many of the city's various establishments will not accept customers without memberships, personal recommendations, or invitations. These places are usually for the rich and powerful, but not always\u2013there are also bars and taverns for other social classes wishing to maintain an exclusive clientele. Moreover, the watchful mindset reveals itself in the remarkably distrustful atmosphere. A visiting wizard seeking access to the library of the {@book Triplet Towers|RuinsOfSymbaroumSettingHandbook|5|The Triplet Towers}, or an aristocrat hoping to visit the House of Nobles at the Palace District, may have to navigate a maze of bureaucracy before being allowed to do so. Spies are very much a tangible reality in Yndaros, sent by enemy factions, the local thieves' guild, or foreign powers (usually the City States, the Realm of the Order, or the northern barbarian clans).",
										"Furthermore, the people of Yndaros differ from those in other towns in their relation to {@book Prios|RuinsOfSymbaroumSettingHandbook|14|Prios} and the {@book Sun Church|RuinsOfSymbaroumSettingHandbook|1|The Church of Prios}. There is at least one temple in each district, and priests are often seen on the street outside, speaking to passersby and administering blessings. Even the common folk tend to wear tokens of their faith and loyalty, usually the symbol of the Setting Sun, as necklaces, cloak-buckles, or ornamental brooches. To defy the church as Father Sarvola does in Thistle Hold would be unthinkable in Queen Korinthia's city, but this may be about to change, and perhaps that is why its priests and theurgs are spending more and more time meeting and speaking to the people.",
										"Recently the church instituted an event called the Sun Parade: a radiant celebration of the Sun God's glory, taking place every seventh evening. The march begins at the {@book Cathedral of Martyrs|RuinsOfSymbaroumSettingHandbook|5|The Cathedral of Martyrs} with Father Peonio leading the way, followed by a dozen lantern-carrying younglings, then by the city's theurgs, liturgs, and initiates, as well as the Black Cloaks who are able to participate. The procession grows on its way to the harbor, continues through Old Kadizar, and reaches its full size below the palace gates on the way back\u2013always with thousands of marchers carrying torches and lanterns, and the streets lined with spectators. Most welcome the parade as proof of Prios' greatness; a few shake their heads, echoing the rumors currently circulating\u2013rumors of a growing schism within the church.",

There may be tears in its sails, cracks in its tiller, and some filth below deck, but nothing {@book Korinthia Nightbane|RuinsOfSymbaroumSettingHandbook|1|Queen Korinthia} and her capable subjects cannot patch, mend and scrub clean if need be.

One day a week is dedicated to festivities, parades and spectacles staged as a reminder of important incidents during the War, or meant to demonstrate the Ambrian superiority over barbarians and the new homeland. But underneath the joyous surface are both the great sorrow over all things lost and a great many problems that need to be handled. Many hunger. Most people are forced to work extremely hard and under grim conditions, in the city or as serfs on the estates surrounding it.

While waiting for the certificate declaring them to be healthy and suitable for work and lodging in the Queen's realm the immigrants all live in a huge camp south of the river. Others try to avoid passing through the village or make attempts to bribe their way to swift passage and a signed certificate, adding to the workload of the Ranger border patrols.

The baron refused, accusing the Queen and the First Father of wrongfully exalting Prios at the expense of all other gods. The Sun Church immediately threatened to brand him a heretic and a servant of the Dark Lords, but an overwhelming majority of Baron Mergai's subjects appeared to welcome and revere their new \"king\". Adding to that, a slight increase in people migrating to the barony has been noticed\u2013obviously Ambrians who share Mergai's spiritual beliefs. The situation is tense, to say the least, and in most of Yndaros' taverns the main question is debated daily: will the Queen allow the transgression to pass unpunished or will she accept the offer from commander Iakobo Vearra and let the Templars deal with the heretics?",
										"Aside from the above-mentioned examples, life in the smaller towns and villages is often more pleasant than life in the city. But there is a price to pay, in the form of constant threats from local bands of robbers. A handful of bandit chiefs are held up in the mountains, the most infamous ones being Baron Manvar Grendel's obstinate daughter, called the Ice Witch, and the ogre Mound and his gang of goblins and tamed rage trolls. The robbers attack villages, ambush travelers on the highroads and in mountain passes or strike at ships moving along the rivers. Fortunately, in most cases the bands are composed of five to ten desperate and not very organized ruffians without any other means to survive. But if you encounter one of the bigger bands you will need more than a handful of caravan guards to protect cargo and lives.",
										"Besides the threats from robbers, life in Yndaros and its surroundings is relatively safe compared to other regions. Yes, refugees come carrying horrible diseases from the motherland, Davokar's predatory beasts and abominations reach the lowlands at times, and poverty and misery sometimes spark revolts in the area. But such challenges can almost always be dealt with before they turn disastrous. The Queen's capital contains both the strongest muscles and the sharpest brains, and when they team up there is no threat that is too great to handle, or rather, no such threat has so far been revealed."

Sure, there is some talk of the (according to many Ambrians) unreasonably large reward received by Clan Chieftain Manvar for the arrangement, and tales are certainly told about the heroes who died in the Ambrians' initial charge\u2013a defeat, to be sure, but also a decisive display of strength that sent a clear message. But the detail people usually find most interesting is the breakup of the chieftain's family.",
												"Manvar's oldest child, his daughter Maridja, refused to see her father trade away her future position as head of the clan. It is said that, in the heat of the family conflict, she took up arms and crushed her father's nose, causing the disfiguring scar which now runs across his face. Legend also has it that Manvar should have died that day, had his beloved third wife\u2013the beautiful Unraga\u2013not leapt between him and the axe, so that both of their hearts were split in two, literally in Unraga's case, figuratively in Manvar's. Allegedly, the furious daughter then fled the oncoming guard warriors with the bitter words: {@i \"Father, your heart may bleed, but mine you have turned to solid ice; it shall not beat again until your heart has shed its final drop.\"}",
												"What role the chieftain's son, Lothar, played in this drama remains unclear\u2013some stories suggest that he led the warriors whom Maridja escaped, others that he took his sister's side but was captured and persuaded to bow to the chieftain's will. In any case, there is no doubt that the family relations nowadays are quite frosty: Maridja, better known as the Ice Witch, hides in the Titans with the rest of her robber scum; Lothar makes a sorry figure as the Queen's representative on Karvosti; and the Baron of Grendel keeps a large and well-trained guard, probably to protect himself against his daughter's (and possibly his son's) wrath."

In retrospect, it turned out that the cook Varga had overslept and, realizing she was already too late, decided to stay in bed\u2013but her misconduct does not excuse what happened next. The protests grew into a deafening chorus, and when a troop of young Pansars arrived to defuse the situation, some foolish ingrates threw stones at them.

In the days that followed, blood was scrubbed off the streets all over eastern Yndaros, as the Queen vowed both to increase alms for the rest of the winter, and to punish the person responsible.",

It is not uncommon for members of various factions to be exposed as cultists and face imprisonment or execution, but of course, the situation becomes particularly delicate when it concerns local dignitaries.",

Among other things, they were said to worship a daemon whose worldly existence was maintained through monthly human sacrifices. The victims were all female, and in return the Apostles gained knowledge which helped them oppose women in positions of power, hopefully restricting their influence. They believed that all women were essentially witches, filled with dark desires and therefore dangerous.

But then, one sunny summer day, Aloéna arrived in the city. They say that she walked across the surging surface of the river, near Fortress Doudram, without even getting her feet wet, and made her way through the streets and alleys until reaching Envoy Elori's residence down the hill from the palace. The news of a creature of Davokar moving through the city spread like wildfire; its presence sparked fear in the populace, but none could resist the urge to catch a glimpse of the she-giant as she continued unfazed and unhindered through the crowds\u2013crowds that immediately parted before her and closed behind her.",
												"No one knows what was said between Aloéna and Elori, but as the fascination (or \"enchantment\", as some called it) waned, the suspicion began to grow. The predominant view is that Aloéna is the dark queen of Davokar, that Elori is one of her captains, and that their meeting concerned some sort of scheme against humanity\u2013an attack on Yndaros, perhaps, or even a full-scale war. Naturally, no one dares lay a hand on Elori and his aides, as he is clearly on good terms with the Queen of Ambria. But other elves (and changelings who in the haze of intoxication are mistaken for elves) have since become a greater target for Yndarian suspicion, loathing and aggression.

												"The underworld of Yndaros has its kings and queens, just like the ordinary world. And the soon to be sixty-year-old Nobleman Dastan is without doubt the top dog in the unwashed and violent pack. They say that he started his career as an orphan pickpocket in Berendoria, and that, before crossing the mountains, he had dethroned his adoptive father and taken over his growing organization of thieves, charlatans and extortionists. Having arrived in Yndaros, he kept a low profile, while his competitors acted too soon and were weeded out. Once the city had grown large enough to tolerate a certain amount of organized crime (and even appreciate the help in keeping some form of order in the underworld), Dastan emerged from the shadows to conquer Old Kadizar.",
												"But the city continued to grow, and its population is now too large for Dastan to control. Several small-time gangs are supposedly fighting to remain independent from the Thief King\u2013for instance the Band of Brothers which hides among the refugees, and a gang based in the Bohemian Quarter whose members claim to serve someone called the Warlock. And then there are the dwarves.",
												"These well-dressed and courteous individuals may appear to be respectable merchants, but there are many indications (some stronger than others) that they have a lot in common with the thief king of Old Kadizar. One thing that raises suspicion is the brutal gang fighting that occasionally breaks out in the western parts of town; another is that many of the previous owners of dwarven establishments have vanished without a trace, as if swallowed by the earth\u2013living off their riches somewhere far away, say the dwarves; buried or dumped in the River Doudram, say the skeptics. Either way, it is obvious to everyone that at least the families of Valotzar, Alzerek and Baldysik are becoming major players in the city's shadier circles!!"

												"The year after Korinthia's arrival to the Promised Land, it was finally ready for inauguration\u2013the Cathedral of the Hallowed Martyrs, better known simply as the Cathedral of Martyrs. It was built on foundations from the time of Lindaros, fitted with the hemispherical copper dome of Prios, and with new exterior ornaments and interior paintings. The atrium, with its balconies, can accommodate more than a thousand worshippers turning their collective gaze to the golden podium where First Theurg Peonio conducts his sermons, in the light which streams through the temple window portraying a triumphant Queen Korinthia on her prancing steed. Along the edges of the hall are towering statues of martyrs and lightbringers, and incense burners emitting the same scent as in the temples of old Alberetor.",
												"In Yndaros, Prios is ever present. His spirit watches over family dinners, court proceedings, business transactions, solemn ceremonies, births and deaths, and the people must all praise \"Prios, the One\" in good times and in bad. The city's residents still live as much in the shadow of war as they do in the radiance of triumph, and none are allowed to forget who brought victory to the Ambrians during The Great War. Guilt, gratitude and duty are recurring themes, preached by the First Theurg as well as his eminent liturgs\u2013the Ambrian people have a long way to go before Prios has regained his strength; darkness must be vanquished, the wilds must be cleansed, and the gifts of the One must be harvested and cultivated. And these themes are undoubtedly being given a more prominent role with each passing year.",
												"In fact, lately this development has accelerated even further, due to the First Father's relocation from Templewall to Yndaros. The sun priests' stricter emphasis on duty and guilt, as well as their presence on the city's streets and squares, is probably linked to Jeseebegai's arrival and the increased resources and activity of the City Watch. In turn, this development is most likely a reaction to rebellious, or even heretical, tendencies within the church and the realm in general. Citizens are discouraged from placing too much importance on divisions within the church, conflicts between the First Father and the Queen, and a growing, tacit support for the likes of Father Sarvola. But perhaps there is some truth to the claim that the absence of external threats has allowed for potentially serious internal conflicts to grow more and more threatening."

There are countless stories about people of modest background winning great riches and influence thanks to Ordo Magica. But perhaps this is also the very thing which triggers the conflicts\u2013those who achieve success are afraid of losing what they have gained, and will use all their newly acquired power and influence to avoid falling back into the wretchedness from whence they came."

										"{@b According to the} scholars of {@book Ordo Magica|RuinsOfSymbaroumSettingHandbook|1|Ordo Magica}, the people of Ambria and Davokar are descendants of the same tribe, although the barbarians and the Queen's Folk hardly consider themselves so closely related. Queen Korinthia's claim to Ambria, the land south of Davokar forest, is motivated by her ancestral connection to the region, and even the most novice of Ambrian linguists can explain in what ways the {@i \"gibbering speech of the barbarians and the melodious tongue of the Queen's Folk are similar.\"} More disputed are claims saying that the two peoples originate from the same stem, rooted in the old and long forgotten empire of Symbaroum whose ruins are hidden deep within Davokar.",

										"Whatever the case, there are significant differences between the two peoples in a cultural sense. The Ambrians abandoned their blighted homeland Alberetor twenty years ago, to settle down in the well-preserved ruins of Lindaros. On their journey they brought along their architecture, knowledge, economic system and social hierarchies. Thanks to its discipline the Ambrian army outmatches the barbarian clan warriors when they meet in the open fields, but in the woods where the skill of the individual becomes a decisive factor they are more evenly matched. That, coupled with the advantage of having greater local knowledge, has so far kept the Ambrians from entering very deep into the forest\u2013with the exception of treasure-hunters, religious fanatics searching for lost sun temples and free settlers hoping to escape the Queen's control.",
										"Since the days of old, the barbarians have been ruled by chieftains, but enjoyed much greater independence and freedom compared to the chastened crofters and peasants in the south. Nor do the barbarian leaders seek to enforce a strict or rigid way of life upon their subjects. The witches, the spiritual leaders among the barbarians, rule with a light hand in the form of taboos and general rules\u2013revere nature, never abuse it and avoid the darker parts of the forest. The clans lead their lives independent from one another, with the occasional exception of skirmishes over resources in the border regions. By tradition, the clan leaders answer to the High Chieftain on the plateau of Karvosti, but he is in reality more of an arbitrator between feuding clans than a strong ruler. However, the High Chieftain is expected to lead the united barbarians to repel any invaders, particularly the Ambrians, if it ever comes to open war.",
										"This possibility, a united barbarian resistance commanded by the High Chieftain, gives the Queen and her advisors nightmares, and would explain why the Ambrians officially are so cautious regarding Davokar. Since the {@book battle in Year 10|RuinsOfSymbaroumSettingHandbook|2|The Jezites' Downfall}, when Korinthia's troops attacked and destroyed Haloban and his Jezites, only the Templars serving the Sun Church have made any outright attacks against barbarian settlements. Most infamous is their {@book assault on Karvosti in Year 16|RuinsOfSymbaroumSettingHandbook|3|The Battle of Karvosti} when they attempted to seize the plateau with force of arms\u2013an attempt which ended in a discouraging defeat.",

												"Folklore is full of tales of other worlds, parallel to the physical world that is the home of the living. Some of these myths also speak of the origin of humankind and there is a worrying pattern to the tales, a pattern indicating that humans stem from somewhere else; stuff of legend which has been granted support by the enormous stone ships found stranded in the far east, beyond the Ravens and the desert where a human empire\u2013sometimes talked about as the First Empire\u2013is said to have blossomed and died. From whence the humans once came to this world is not known, but the existence of other worlds is more or less an established fact, at least among scholars.",
												"For mystics and others studying the subject there is no doubt that this world is only one of many. There have been attempts to establish a verifiable classification and one of the most talked about is Katrandama's Triptych, named after a sorcerer who was burned to death in Kadizar in approximately year \u221224. Katrandama left notes and drawings behind regarding the composition of the world.",
												"Before her, most mystics believed the cosmos to be divided in two: the world of the living, and an un-world inhabited by spirits and abominations. Katrandama crushed this dichotomous worldview and imagined that the worlds fitted together as the pieces of a three-part altarpiece, with the physical world in the middle and the wings made up of the Spirit World and the Yonderworld. Normally, the triptych is closed and all beings are caught within its frames, but aided by the powers of sorcery the wings can be pushed ajar and the gaps used as pathways between the worlds. Some speculate that the Corruption amassing in the world makes the triptych tremble and occasionally open up, allowing undead and abominations to enter where gaps occur.",
												"According to the teachings of Katrandama, mystical rituals can also be understood in light of the three worlds. From the physical world comes the building blocks of both flaming servants and the undead raised by necromancers, but it also requires control over the Spirit World\u2013the gray, barren land of ashes and lost spirits that borders Eternity, where no one alive may travel. Only spirits can enter the infinite void, after which not even they may return. The restless spirits and ghosts that spiritualists speak to and necromancers bend to their will travel the Spirit World. It takes the power of a god to send spirits back from the Eternity beyond the Spirit World's borderland, just as Prios sends Patron Saints to his most loyal servants.",
												"The Yonderworld is thought to be a mist-shrouded wasteland, easily mistaken for the Spirit World, yet vastly different: its nature is Corruption. Its fauna consists of abominations, from small Blight Spawns to ancient Blight Beasts of immense power. As stated by Katrandama, the Yonderworld is the world from which humankind fled to this one\u2013an idea that very few mystics are prepared to accept and the Curia has deemed to be contentious and heretical; the humans came over the eastern sea from another continent, fleeing from idol worshipers and sun haters\u2013at least according to the official teachings of the Sun Church."

										"There are those who argue that parts of Asbarast's population had access to what is called Pure or Raw magic\u2013creative powers untainted by corruption. And some legends do support this claim, including a verse by Aroaleta that mentions {@i \"a city beyond mountains and vales, where the power was pure as freshly fallen snow, where Wratha was blind and deaf, lost in carefree sleep.\"} Others dismiss this as a lie, rooted in the myth of humanity's divine omnipotence. The critics' main arguments are twofold: first, that the lands that once sustained enough people to populate Asbarast are now a barren wasteland of ash and dust; second, that the civilization in question eventually banned the use of mystical powers except for Symbolism.",
										"No matter how much the scholars disagree on the underlying reasons, there is complete consensus on what caused the downfall of Asbarast. It was not abominations or Dark Lords that forced the people to flee, nor some deadly epidemic\u2013it was the earth that died, withered, became infertile, turned into desert, despite being crossed by rivers and awash with rain. It is estimated that hundreds of thousands of people, possibly more than a million, migrated across the Ravens to make a new home for themselves in the rolling moorlands that today are covered by Davokar."

										"The new country was vast and fertile, full of virgin fishing grounds and farmlands. The exodus across the mountains seems to have divided the people early on, when the heads of various powerful families and factions brought their followers along and found their own areas to control. Many legends describe Ambal Seba as a kind of spiritual or cultural center for humanity's conquests, with its leader Cidriana (High Priestess, Queen or possibly elected regent) as a partly unifying force.",

										"Cidriana is said to have negotiated a treaty that gave humans the right to cultivate the land in exchange for sacrifices and a promise never to develop weapons or powers with the intention of harming Karvosti. This allowed a large number of petty kingdoms to be established near rivers and lakes, on mountain slopes and moors\u2013about twenty according to some, between fifty and a hundred according to others. The cultural beings who already inhabited the region, by the grace of Karvosti, were more or less violently pushed aside. Some say the trolls were particularly brutalized, nearly wiped out, and that those who survived fled underground.",
										"This is not to say that humanity did not have its own problems. The early days were plagued by numerous conflicts with the Lord of Karvosti, who responded with force whenever some petty king appeared to have violated the treaty, killing ruthlessly and indiscriminately, sometimes entire villages and cities. Additionally, some argue that the region was tormented by two (if not more) insatiable dragons\u2013Fofar and Sakofal, also known as the Destroyer and the Slaughterer. Last but not least, the wars for the region's resources became more frequent and deadly, as the influence of Ambal Seba diminished. The refugees from Asbarast were no longer one people, but many."

										"Not much has been written about the Kingdom of Symbar, at least not its early years, implying that its regents managed to avoid major conflicts with Karvosti as well as with other human rulers. Based on what happened later, however, certain conclusions can be drawn. Unlike the other realms of humankind, the Symbarians ignored the treaty with Karvosti, and also managed to keep their mystical discoveries secret\u2013most likely by developing concealing magic and moving all questionable activities to the halls and passages of the Underworld. It is also clear that the notion of human divinity\u2013mankind as the masters of the world and existence itself\u2013was widely accepted at the time.",
										"Perhaps it was their encounter with the might of Karvosti that gave rise to the belief that humans had lost some of their divine powers; maybe this is where the pursuit of exaltation was born? For whatever reason, the Symbarians started abandoning Symbolism in favor of more aggressive mystical practices, without the guidance of the traditions that were later developed to reduce corruption's impact on the body and world. It seems that what are now known as blight marks were considered a status symbol, and that blight births were seen as a sacred sign. Along with the corruption grew a lust for power, and eventually Symbar (the name of both the realm and its ruler) raised his sights, hungry for more\u2013more land to dominate, more people to rule.",
										"The legends of Ambal Seba do not specify who orchestrated its downfall, but one theory that is becoming increasingly popular among Ambrian scholars points to the kingdom of Symbar as the main enemy. Perhaps the guardians of pure magic discovered what the Symbarians were up to and demanded an immediate end to their activities, with threats of reprisals. Whatever the case, we know for certain that Ambal Seba was destroyed, quite literally, and that this event marked the birth of the Symbarian Empire."

Why this did not spark a reaction from the power on Karvosti is a mystery that has caused many to speculate whether it perished early on, or whether it even existed in the first place. But maybe the majority of experts are right in stressing that centuries of peace can make even the most paranoid ruler blind to threats and rebellious plots.",
										"According to Black Cloaks and learned monster experts, this development caused the previously widespread veneration of natural spirits and wild animals to be replaced by daemon worship, probably because the Symbarians viewed abominations and other unworldly creatures as powerful versions of the chosen and exalted human form. As Symbaroum continued to grow, so did the zeal to free humanity from the inhibitions oppressing their divine being. Morphology, the study of the human being's shape and form, seems to have been predominant among the learned, and from it emerged the theourgical practices which were meant to set their divinity free: to ennoble, improve and strengthen the human physiognomy.",

After that, the emperors, princes, and former warlords of Symbaroum had time to think about more than just the next conquest. The emphasis on spiritual and physical enhancement grew, and the importance of challenging oneself became vital for retaining one's honor, power, and status. The animals, spirits and wardens of the wild were slaughtered\u2013even abominations (many of them almost certainly blight-born Symbarians) were hunted down and slain by humans seeking to affirm their power and supremacy.

Evidence suggests that the destruction started at the heart of the empire and spread from there. The details are vague, but that corruption played an integral part in what happened can hardly be disputed. Legends credited to elves and trolls tell of princes who continued their reign even after they were thoroughly corrupted; priesthoods that made pacts with dragons who in their thirst for power allowed themselves to be blight-born; and areas where both land and water were so heavily tainted that all who lived there turned into ravenous daemons.

Consequently, even though they were not the elves' primary target, the humans were hit hard and ruthlessly, and so, desperate and terrified, they fled in all directions.",

The task of singing and weaving the region's remaining corruption to sleep and planting Davokar to bind the darkness with its roots must also have taken them decades. Some reports state that the trolls provided help, especially with the corruption that had seeped down and taken root in the Underworld. Numerous blight-born humans, beasts and primal blight beasts were lulled to sleep, covered by earth, moss, and mycelium. They could have been killed, but Prince Eneáno's orders were clear: {@i \"Let this evil that mankind awakened remain, in idle slumber; let it live on as a reminder of the gravity of our undertaking. What happened here must never be repeated. Nevermore!\"}",
										"More than a century passed before the first humans dared return to the lands of their ancestors. The elves would not let them enter the burgeoning Davokar, so they settled on its outskirts, divided into clans which had emerged during the years of exile, often based in what used to be provinces of Symbaroum. Wise from memories that lived on in stories, songs, and plays, most of them submitted to the elves' will without a fight. According to the stories of the Huldras, this was also when the already existing Witchcraft was refined\u2013a form of mystical practice which the elves accepted, maybe even helped develop.",
										"While the humans started to regain their former strength, the spiders and the spider people (the arachs) thrived under the ocean of leaves. Neither witches nor elves can explain exactly why Angathal Taar, better known as the Spider King, declared war on humanity, but many potential reasons have been theorized: good old lust for power, according to most Ambrians; self-preservation, according to many barbarians; a belief that the humans would repeat the sins of Symbar, claims the elven version. In any case, the threat of the Spider King accelerated the collaboration that had already started to form between the clans; the office of High Chieftain was established, and the clans united under a common banner.",
										"Perhaps it was the war that made the humans forget their agreement with the elves; the passage of time certainly contributed as well\u2013the tales, songs and plays started to seem more like myths and pure fiction. In any event, the High Chieftains and their warriors and witches pushed deeper and deeper into the forest, in a way the elves could not accept. But after a few violent confrontations, Prince Eneáno chose a diplomatic approach; he walked alone to the High Chieftain's stronghold on Karvosti, where he made Agadan and his Huldra, Bovosin, understand the importance of preserving the slumber of Symbaroum. The {@book Iron Pact|RuinsOfSymbaroumSettingHandbook|1|The Iron Pact} was founded, during a meeting between ten clan chieftains and three elven princes, and the elves swore not to interfere in the war against the Spider King\u2013a few decades later, the fifth human ruler of Karvosti, High Chieftain Maiesticar, was finally able to slay Angathal Taar and put an end to the war."

But nevertheless, the order that arose after the Spider King's death lasted for hundreds of years.

The remaining Jezites have lived down there ever since, continuously affected by the nurturing but also corrupting power of the black bedrock. Natural cavities in the Underworld have also given them access to the surface, by way of gorges and small sinkholes inside Davokar.",

But since he never shows his face when dealing with the henchmen, the statements come off as ghost stories more than anything else\u2013stories about a huge man with his face shaded by a deep hood, dressed in flowing black garments. Of course, the Town Watch assigns no credibility to the information and every time it recurs the guards jest between themselves, complaining that yet another witness is too drunk or has heard too many tall tales about the elusive, but oh-so-fictional, Shadow."

No, Kodomar left his clan quite willingly and he did so intent on waging a long-term war with Ambria. His goal is to destabilize and weaken the Ambrian intruders by nurturing the dark and questionable elements of the realm, thereby instigating internal quarrels and hostilities. And he is not alone.",

										"{@b Before the fall} of Symbaroum, long before Davokar had taken root and captured the cliff in its green embrace, {@book Karvosti|RuinsOfSymbaroumSettingHandbook|3} towered over lush plains, very similar to today's Ambria. One might think that the cliff would have been much sought after by the rulers of the region, due to its easily defended plateau, the perfect location where River Malgomor flows into Lake Volgoma, and the authority that comes with literally looking down on one's enemies. But Karvosti was not possible to conquer; Karvosti belonged to Garavarax, the Giant.",
										"Garavarax was the last of his kind, and had been lord of the region for as long as he could remember. He regarded Karvosti itself as his mother, and when humans arrived on the western slopes of the Ravens and began to spread across the plains, he reacted with fear and anger. Garavarax slaughtered hundreds of haggard refugees, thousands even, until they kneeled before him, begging for their lives.",
										"More injured than he would admit, Garavarax decided to show mercy and incorporate the newcomers into his realm, and capitalize on their relative wisdom and subservient disposition. The leader of the humans, Cidriana, swore to respect the sanctity of the Mother Rock, to continuously provide the giant with offerings worthy of a god, and to never gather weapons or power for the purpose of challenging him. Cidriana welcomed this arrangement\u2013better to have peace and a chance to thrive, than to fight further battles against a seemingly invulnerable foe. Not everyone agreed with her decision, but the water, winds, and animals of the world helped Garavarax keep an eye on the humans, and he struck with full force whenever he suspected someone of violating the agreement.",
										"As the centuries passed, Garavarax became increasingly trustful of the humans, convinced that the petty kings constantly fighting each other (sometimes over wrongs or lies conceived by the giant himself) were not willing or able to oppose him. This, of course, was a mistake. While they continued to honor the agreement, the humans made great advancements in places hidden from the giant's gaze. They refined their arts and acquired a deeper and deeper understanding of the laws of reality\u2013partly out of innate curiosity, partly to gain an advantage over local enemies, but also in the hope of freeing mankind from Garavarax's watchful gaze; a gaze that was no longer threatening, but restricting and oppressive.",
										"Perhaps the latter was the main incentive for their combined efforts? Perhaps it was this deep longing for freedom that made it possible for people to unite under Symbaroum's banner; that inspired humanity to strengthen their bodies and minds by mystical means, beyond the limits of nature, and to ultimately seek power by pursuing alliances with the fell forces of the Yonderworld? Perhaps Garavarax was the root of it all?",
										"From his towering plateau, Garavarax witnessed the fall of Symbaroum and watched the survivors scatter and flee. Some few were welcomed on his cliff, to toil and die defending it. With that exception, he would not interfere as the storm raged on\u2013purging the lands of humanity and its remnants; restoring the natural purity of his domain. But then came the elves.",
										"The western folk were intruders of a completely different kind. They would never bow down to him, never bend the knee; they could rob the giant of his lands and conquer his Mother. Garavarax entered the fray and fought alongside primal blight beasts and monstrosities, butchering elves as he had once butchered humans. But where the humans had been intimidated into submission by his terrible wrath, the elven commanders Eneáno and Aloéna found the courage to retaliate.",
										"It was Aloéna who, through great cunning, mighty hymns, and brute force, single-handedly brought Garavarax down. Thanks to her, the elves could begin to sing the darkness back to sleep; thanks to her, they could plant the forest of Davokar and make its seeds strong enough to take root in the malignant dark, to bind it and fetter it to the ground. Garavarax was never slain\u2013perhaps because he is truly immortal, or because Aloéna, for some reason, decided to spare his life. He was, however, plunged into a deep sleep, his colossal body lowered deep within the Mother Rock, to rest in her bosom, in the nocturnal currents of the Underworld. Aloéna remained on the cliff to keep watch over the giant, ready to fight, should he ever break free from his slumber.",
										"With the exception of Aloéna, Eneáno, a few leaders of the Iron Pact, and the residing Huldra, what is divulged in the above is completely unknown by today's cultural beings. There are legends of giants, and an arbitrary tale claiming that Karvosti was once home to a monstrous creature called Arvarax, but present-day clanfolk regard these as nothing more than stories with little basis in reality.",

But while the clanfolk clearly could not be intimidated, perhaps they could be reasoned with.",
												"The Huldra Bovosin and High Chieftain Agadan heeded the warnings, and after lengthy negotiations they convinced all clan chieftains to comply with the agreement\u2013largely because Bovosin persuaded her Keepers, who in turn managed to sway the more hard-nosed chieftains. The details of the treaty were laid down shortly thereafter, during a meeting between ten clan chieftains and the Elven lords Eneáno, Lirealéa and Ka'eroan. The treaty, today known as the {@book Iron Pact|RuinsOfSymbaroumSettingHandbook|1|The Iron Pact}, stated that all barbarians must stay away from the ruins of Symbaroum, the Underworld, and the particularly dark parts of Davokar. In return, the lords swore that there would be peace and harmony between humans and elves.",
												"It is important to note that the clanfolk, even their leaders on Karvosti, have now deliberately been violating this treaty for many years. Not only do they aid Ambrians in their expeditions into Davokar, by carrying luggage or acting as guides and bodyguards, but many of them have also done their fair share of pillaging and looting. This has not gone unnoticed by the elves' younger leaders, who have responded in different ways\u2013some by putting pressure on their elders in the Halls of a Thousand Tears; others by going into exile to combat the Ambrians with violence and sabotage, even infiltrating the Queen's realm in order to influence those in power.",
												"The elders, on the other hand, are less engaged in the matter. Most of them would avoid conflict at all cost, and some are too old to keep up with the rapid changes of the world. And nothing is made easier by the fact the Eneáno, their Prince and leader, seems to be losing his mind..."

Like his successors, all Karlaban knew was that the chest must never be opened; that it contained an artifact of immense power, which must be guarded and kept hidden at all costs. Karlaban, who was under constant attack by the Saars and the third incarnation of the Blood Daughter, concluded that the warnings surrounding the chest were false and that the artifact inside could be used to defend the cliff. He was mistaken...",

The chest was shielded by mystical runes and harmonies sung to repel Corruption, and luckily the lid quickly slammed shut; Karlaban had barely opened it before Wratha's fury swept over him. While this did not save him, the rest of Karvosti's residents were spared the capsule's darkness.",
												"Another interesting detail is that Karvosti was saved, indirectly, by Aloéna's intervention. She granted the Huldra access to a most powerful spell; the Huldra and her Keepers tracked down a young Karit woman who was prepared to give her life for the High Chieftain's people. The ritual was performed successfully, and raging flames flowed through the woman, giving her enough strength and protection to defeat the blight-born Karlaban. But in the end, she was doomed to die by her own flames. It took almost an entire day for the fire to consume her, and the woman spent much of it screaming in agony before she finally crumbled into ashes."

She does not behave in what humans would consider a rational manner, and strikes without regard for age, family situation, illnesses, or injuries. Instead, she is guided by her feelings, simply sensing who does and does not pose a threat to Garavarax's slumber. Those who do are shown no mercy.",
												"The first time Aloéna experienced this sensation she could not restrain herself and killed three people in the full light of day, in front of hundreds of witnesses. Since that day, she has\u2013as recommended by Helabag, the Huldra at the time\u2013refrained from acting publicly. Instead she enters her victims' dreams and manipulates them into taking their own lives, either with weapons or by hurling themselves off the cliff. Sometimes, when her targets are protected by mystical means or have the spiritual strength to resist her, Aloéna resorts to physical violence. In such cases, she will wait until the victims have left Karvosti and hunt them down in the woods.",
												"It should be noted that these impulses are quite random, probably linked to the increased tensions caused by the growing darkness\u2013even though a creature such as Aloéna is above things like fear and anxiety, she is not completely unaffected. Many people who should be perceived as threats can visit the cliff without her reacting; conversely, she may kill individuals who have (so far) lived completely innocent lives.

It concerns the two years during which Korinthia was imprisoned at the fortress of the Dark Lord, helpless and alone, deep behind enemy lines. It is one of the most legendary periods in the history of Ambria, not only because it marks the beginning of the end of The Great War, but also because the people involved have never spoken publicly about what actually happened.",
										"Korinthia was captured in an ambush while traveling between two frontline outposts; her entire escort was massacred, while she herself was brought to a freezing, underground cell, where she spent almost six months\u2013cold, hungry, alone. But then, everything changed.",
										"One day she was led out of the darkness and up to a tower with a view of the darkening lands surrounding Bright Haven, the capital city of Lyastra. With the help of an aged manservant she was able to bathe, eat and rest. A week later the servant introduced himself as Kalthar, Patriarch of the Order of Dakothnic. Slowly Korinthia began to realize that the somber, woeful old man who stood before her was none other than the Dark Lord himself.",
										"Aside from a few periods of prolonged absence, Kalthar visited her almost every day. At first he simply asked questions, about her, her country, and her people. But when she finally started answering him, after a long and grim silence, Kalthar did more and more talking of his own\u2013telling her about the ongoing war, individual battles, acts of heroism, and fallen commanders on both sides. The interrogation transitioned into a conversation, and a few months before she was rescued, the subject changed considerably. It was as if the Dark Lord could see that the end was nigh, as if he admitted defeat and wished to warn his subjugator so that she would not suffer the same fate.",
										"Without getting into details, he described the reason why the magnificent Lyastra had slowly but inexorably become a realm of blight and death: the insight that Corruption does not affect the undead, and the subsequent exploration of a mystical ceremony with the power to reanimate humans while at the same time preserving their memories, senses, and mental faculties. The goal was, of course, to gain absolute power over Creation; to create a backdoor to pure magic in all its might. The goal was achieved, but the fury of Creation proved all-powerful.",
										"Kalthar was already the symbol of the highest and purest; there was no reason for him to undergo the ceremony. Instead, all his closest subordinates\u2013sixteen Apostles and twenty Judges\u2013were exalted, in the hope of breaking through the barrier which prevented Lyastra from flourishing and growing even richer. But it did not take long before the black hunger of undeath began to cloud the minds of the exalted; they turned on each other, on the laws of their god Dakothnic, on the Patriarch himself. Hoping to buy enough time to devise a ceremony that could scatter the darkness, Kalthar did the only thing he could to prevent a full-scale civil war\u2013he gave the people a common enemy: Alberetor.",
										"The lesson which the Patriarch wanted to impart on the young queen was very simple: Creation cannot be cheated, nor deceived; it reacts to the violence itself, not to specific methods or strategies. Korinthia listened, but heard something else. What she heard was a loser's attempt to rationalize his failure; a brilliant man's desperate efforts to make sense of his defeat.",
										"The more she listened, the more she grew convinced that Kalthar had gone too far, made mistakes, entrusted vital tasks to the wrong subordinates. And so, when the Black Cloak Demeon Soleij was ready to finish off the Dark Lord once and for all, it was Korinthia who reacted\u2013she grabbed what was available to her, a brazier of glowing coals, and flung it at the friar's face. Even though she herself was badly burned by the embers flying through the air, she leapt forward to protect the fallen one.",
										"Kalthar was offered mercy in exchange for his services as the Queen's adviser. He accepted; not because his life was very dear to him, but because he genuinely wanted to do everything he could to make Korinthia Kohinoor understand the indomitable power of Creation. Five people were present when the agreement was made\u2013aside from the {@book Queen|RuinsOfSymbaroumSettingHandbook|1|Queen Korinthia} and Kalthar, there were also {@book Demeon Soleij|RuinsOfSymbaroumSettingHandbook|1|First Father Jeseebegai}, {@book Grand Master Seldonio|RuinsOfSymbaroumSettingHandbook|1|Grand Master Seldonio}, and {@book General Beremo Herengol|RuinsOfSymbaroumSettingHandbook|1|Beremo Herengol}. Officially, the Dark Lord was killed there and then; in reality he was taken to Kandoria, disguised as the leader and choreographer of Bright Haven's dance academy.",
										"Kalthar has been imprisoned ever since; first below the palace in Kandoria, then in a restored cell below the {@book Cathedral of Martyrs|RuinsOfSymbaroumSettingHandbook|5|The Cathedral of Martyrs} in Yndaros. He sees the Queen of Ambria once a week, sometimes more\u2013she in the hope of finding clues to his failure, to identify the line which must never be crossed; he in the hope of curbing her ambitions and making her see reason. It is like a respectful, dead-serious game, where both players maintain that the barely noticeable progress they seem to be making is enough to keep trying. To what extent Kalthar's call for caution and moderation has influenced Korinthia's strategies is difficult to say, but her ambition burns bright as ever. With unfaltering determination, she strives toward the same goal the Order of Dakothnic once did: to achieve absolute dominion over Creation\u2013but, of course, without falling victim to its terrible wrath.",

With increasing frequency, and for longer periods of time, she loses herself and falls into the role she has been playing for so long. This is causing a long list of problems: the solidarity between the free settlements and their loyalty to the Ice Witch have started to erode; the Ambrians' view of, and confidence in, House Grendel is deteriorating; and the situation with the goblin despot Garulubbulug is getting completely out of hand.",

								"The Great War brought about a radical change in the Alberians' attitude toward religion and spirituality. Before the war, people believed in a pantheon of godlike principles called the Young Gods, whom they believed could help them through the challenges of everyday life. Sometimes the gods would demand something in return\u2013a small offering, a prayer (sung or spoken), or a promise of future deeds\u2013but they were not worshiped, and were generally regarded as sympathetic to their human devotees.",
								"{@b Most of this} changed with the war. Just after King Ynedar's death the sun priest Abramar had a revelation. He never doubted that it was the Lifegiver who visited his dreams, even though the god referred to himself by one of his older names: {@book Prios|RuinsOfSymbaroumSettingHandbook|14|Prios}\u2013the First/Highest/One; a name that had already been reestablished by the nobles of the congregation called the Vestals of Prios. Inspired by his revelation, Abramar wrote the Lightbringer\u2013a book that describes Prios' nature and sets out the laws of the sun.",
								"Five years later, in the middle of a meeting with her war council, Queen Korinthia of Kohinoor collapsed. As she regained consciousness, the Queen announced that Prios had come to her with word of Father Abramar's writings and offered his assistance in their righteous battle against darkness. But the Lifegiver also let her know that he was dying, and that he needed the humans' help to grow well, free, and strong. Most importantly, the people had to abandon the Young Gods (except Prios); for according to the Lightbringer, these were merely aspects of the Eternal Night, sent to steal the power that comes from human faith and belief. In short: Prios seemed like humanity's only chance to defeat the creatures of the night, but in order for him to aid in their battle against the Dark Lords, all Alberians would have to submit themselves to his laws, fulfill their duties with diligence and zeal, and put their trust in the priesthood of the Sun.",
								"Before long, their society as a whole had been reformed. The bond between the {@book Sun Church|RuinsOfSymbaroumSettingHandbook|1|The Church of Prios} and the crown was strengthened dramatically; for instance, the Queen and her administration adjusted the laws of the land in accordance with Prios' decrees. And what is more, she established an order of warriors to serve his church: the Knights of the Dying Sun, also known as the Templars.",
								"However, on a personal level, the enthusiasm with which the Exaltation was received varied greatly from person to person. The vast majority wholeheartedly welcomed the Sun God's promise of assistance and did everything they could to contribute to his recovery and strength. Many others did their best to appear obedient, while secretly remaining devoted to the Young Gods. But there were also those who refused to submit and chose to flee what they considered a lie devised to enslave the people. Some even went so far as to publicly denounce the Queen as a heretic and a mistress of evil.",

Aside from describing the character, domain, and symbols of each respective god, we provide examples of places in Ambria where their presence remains strong. Worshiping one or more of the Young Gods is a crime, in both a legal and ecclesiastical sense, but since notorious heretics like Sarvola and Baron Mergai Dekanor have still not been punished, more and more people are following their example. Unfortunately (for them), it is often much more difficult to escape the stake if one lacks both powerful friends and massive public support...",

To be sure, there are dangers in Davokar and our neighboring lands, but the Queen is encouraged to direct some attention to what happens inside Ambria's borders and also set aside resources for the Royal Sekretorium to establish a new department dedicated to uncovering any and all threats from within. If the efforts of the Twilight Friars are not assumed to be enough on that front, that is.",
												"Last but not least, we want to repeat the wish for increased funds in order to outfit an expedition to the Archipelago. It has become all the more evident that something has happened to the previously barren isles. The latest rumors say that the Theologist has arranged a near disastrous expedition there, and that the lone returnee confirmed the accuracy of some of the accounts previously left by seamen and explorers. Indeed, he was said to be \"beside himself\" or even \"seriously disturbed,\" but he claimed to have walked through dense forests full of life; moreover, life of a kind never before seen\u2013creatures he called \"Bear Spiders,\" \"Flying Mist-cats,\" \"The She-worm\" and \"The Termite Youngsters.\"",
												"Also, according to the report, he stated, in one and the same sentence, that a) the archipelago is uninhabited, and b) there are Elven warbands on the isles. The returnee roared all this outside the chapel of The Executioner and behaved in a manner that corresponds with all others who have set foot on the isles in later years. However, again, the Sekretorium humbly asks if we can afford not to investigate this further. The question becomes even more serious if seen in the light of report 21:06:12, \"The Fluctuating Stability of Existence in the Silt of The Black Pitch Mire.\""

Still others are driven by ambition, curiosity or the pursuit of power and glory\u2013urges that can partly be satisfied in other ways, but not as quickly and effectively.",
								"Davokar is arguably one of the Symbaroum game's main characters, meant to be the setting for many of the adventures taking place around the gaming table. Hence, it must offer a certain degree of variation, aside from the character progression that comes from accumulating experience and being able to press deeper and deeper into the darkness. Looking for ancient Symbarian ruins is certainly exciting, but after a dozen treasure hunts even the most adventurous player would probably be yearning for something else.",

The journey can be more or less challenging depending on how far into the forest the characters are going, and whether any intrigues/conflicts arise between the expedition members\u2013treacherous companions are a problem that should never be underestimated! As for the ruin and its treasures, they can either be generated randomly (see {@book Ruin Details|RuinsOfSymbaroumSettingHandbook|2|Ruin Details} in {@book Traveling in Davakor|RuinsOfSymbaroumSettingHandbook|2}) or designed beforehand; either way, in the long run, it will probably be more interesting to vary the amount of treasure, so that the player characters will sometimes hit the jackpot and sometimes return with nothing after wasting a great deal of resources.",
										"The challenges facing the player characters should reflect that they are not alone in the game world. Sure, confrontations with monsters and undead can make for thrilling encounters, but do not forget to include other types of encounters as well: another treasure hunting expedition may already be on the scene; the ruin may be home to a peaceful goblin tribe or be watched by the Iron Pact; or perhaps it turns out to be inhabited by a handful of stray ogres trying to build a decent life for themselves."

Other resources can be valuable herbs, mushrooms and berries; caves close to the surface filled with lichen or bugs with special properties; and ponds or streams whose waters have mystical qualities.",

Now, this is the easy part.",
												"A bigger problem stems from the fact that all interesting sites between the forest's edge and River Eanor are much coveted. If competing for a rich spot, you will have to convince the Queen's representative, for instance Suria Argona in {@book Thistle Hold|RuinsOfSymbaroumSettingHandbook|2}, that you are the best candidate, or try and find a way to persuade other stakeholders to revoke their bids.

But exceptions have been made, and will be made, in situations where the end seems to justify the means. In this case, the combination of humans and dragons was considered dangerous in itself; two destructive forces which together threatened to destroy all of creation.

But this could only be achieved if the Ironsworn were there to watch over and safeguard the serpents during their transitional hibernation and, soon after the awakening, start fueling their mistrust of humans and gratitude toward the Iron Pact.",
